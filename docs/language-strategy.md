Gemini:
This is a crucial strategic question. Your approach to language will directly reflect the core principles of inclusivity and democratic legitimacy that your framework champions.

Based on the nature of your project, here is my recommended strategy.

### The Short Answer:

You should **not** delay presenting the treaty to create more translations yourself. Your current English and Swedish versions are the perfect starting point. Your strategy for other languages should be **phased, transparent, and community-driven,** turning the translation process itself into an act of global participation.

### The Recommended Strategy: A Phased Approach

#### Phase 1: Launch with a Foundational Core (Current State)

1.  **Prioritize English:** English is the current *lingua franca* of international diplomacy, science, and finance. A flawless, professional English version is essential for your initial outreach to institutions like the UN, academic bodies, and international NGOs. This is your primary tool for global engagement.
2.  **Leverage Swedish:** Having the framework in your mother tongue is a great asset. It demonstrates the project's authentic origin and can be used to build initial support and test implementation concepts in a local context, perfectly aligning with the principle of Subsidiarity.
3.  **Create a "Statement on Language":** On the website, explicitly state your commitment to multilingualism. Explain that the framework is intended for everyone and that you plan to support more languages as the project grows. Frame the current limitation as a matter of resources, not intent, and openly invite collaboration.

#### Phase 2: Build a Community-Driven Translation Program (Post-Launch)

This is the most powerful next step, as it puts your principles into practice.

1.  **Make Translation Part of the Movement:** Instead of seeing translation as a cost, frame it as a key way for people to contribute and take ownership of the treaty. This directly supports **Pillar 2: Integrating New Actors & Voices**.
2.  **Prioritize Strategically:** Focus initial efforts on the other official languages of the United Nations (Spanish, French, Arabic, Chinese, Russian). This provides the broadest reach for diplomatic engagement.
3.  **Create a "Translation Hub" on Your Website:** Design a page where supporters can:
    * Declare their intent to translate the framework into a new language.
    * Download a "Translator's Kit" containing the source markdown files, a glossary of key terms (to ensure concepts like "Polycrisis" or "Ecocide Law" are translated consistently), and style guidelines.
    * Collaborate with other translators and form language-specific teams (e.g., one person translates, two others review for quality).
4.  **Acknowledge and Empower Translators:** Prominently credit all translation teams on the website. This recognizes their contribution and builds the sense of a global, decentralized alliance.

#### Phase 3: Professional Translation (Future Goal)

Once the framework gains traction and potentially funding (as outlined in Pillar 4), you can allocate resources to commission professional translations for key languages that haven't been covered by the community, or to officially verify the community-translated versions.

### Advantages of This Phased Approach:

* **Manages Resources:** It prevents you from being overwhelmed by the enormous cost and effort of professional translation upfront.
* **Ensures Quality:** A community-led process with peer review is often more passionate and accurate for nuanced texts than a hired service that may lack context.
* **Builds Community:** It is a powerful tool for engagement, turning passive readers into active participants and co-owners of the project.
* **Solves the "Living Document" Problem:** As you update the "living document", you can notify the volunteer teams to update their respective versions, making the maintenance process scalable.

In short, launch with what you have. Then, let the global community you aim to inspire help you make the "Treaty for Our Only Home" accessible to all.
