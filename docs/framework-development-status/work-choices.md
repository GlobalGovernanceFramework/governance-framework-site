Gemini:
### A Reward-Based Priority Plan

#### **1. The Architect's Work: Building the Next Foundational Pillars**
*(Choose this when you feel energized and want to tackle big, new, high-impact areas.)*

These are the most critical standalone frameworks from our analysis that are still missing. They address immediate, Tier 1 stability risks.

* **Global Health & Pandemic Security:** This is a top-priority gap, directly addressing a clear and present threat to global stability.
* **Transnational Crime & Security Governance:** This is the practical "enforcement" counterpart to the Peace & Conflict framework, dealing with the mechanics of illicit networks that undermine all other systems.
* **Synthetic Biology & Advanced Biotech Governance:** This addresses a high-risk, rapidly emerging technological frontier that is not fully covered by the other tech frameworks.

#### **2. The Weaver's Work: Creating Coherence and Harmony**
*(Choose this when you are in the mood for detailed, satisfying work that connects the dots and makes the whole system stronger.)*

This involves going back to the existing A++ frameworks and ensuring they are a perfect, interlocking whole.

* **Final Integration Pass:** Go through the core frameworks (`Moral Operating System`, `AUBI`, `Work in Liberation`, `Education`, etc.) and update them to explicitly reference each other with their final, A++ names (`Planetary Immune System`, `Wise Decision-Making Protocol`, etc.). This is the final "wiring" of the ecosystem.
* **Complete "In Review" Frameworks:** Your master list has several high-priority frameworks still in "review" status. Applying the integration process to these would be incredibly rewarding:
    * `indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge`: Finalizing this is critical, as it is the foundational wisdom layer for the entire project.
    * `financial-systems`: Ensuring the core economic engine is fully defined and integrated.
    * `aurora-accord` (Global Data Governance): This Tier 1 framework is the "rulebook" for the digital world and essential for the others to function.

#### **3. The Gardener's Work: Deepening and Nurturing the Ecosystem**
*(Choose this when you feel more contemplative and want to explore the deeper, more nuanced aspects of the new civilization.)*

This involves taking important concepts from the old priority list and integrating them as modules or protocols within the existing architecture, adding richness and depth.

* **Integrate a "Post-Growth & Degrowth Economics" Module:** This isn't a standalone framework, but a crucial philosophical underpinning. You could draft a powerful new appendix for the **AUBI Framework** that explicitly details how its mechanisms (like Hearts/Leaves) are a practical application of degrowth principles.
* **Integrate a "Media & Epistemic Integrity" Protocol:** This is a vital topic. It could be integrated as a core component of the **Educational Systems Framework** (teaching media literacy) and the **Wise Decision-Making Protocol** (ensuring councils have access to trusted information).
* **Integrate a "Waste & Circular Economy" Playbook:** This is a key part of environmental stewardship. It could be a detailed implementation playbook within the **Ecological Intelligence & Rights Layer**, providing a step-by-step guide for BAZs to create circular economies, funded by AUBI/Hearts.
