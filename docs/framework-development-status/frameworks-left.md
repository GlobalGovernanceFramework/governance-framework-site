New list of extra frameworks:

The following refined priority list is based on a multi-criteria analysis that considers:

* **Urgency:** The immediacy of the threat if left unaddressed.
* **Systemic Impact:** The degree to which this framework is a prerequisite for or enables the success of other frameworks.
* **Existential Risk:** The potential for irreversible, catastrophic consequences.
* **Current Governance Deficit:** The scale of the gap between the need for governance and the current reality.

Here is a proposed granular prioritization, starting from the most urgent.

### Refined & Granular Priority List for New Frameworks

| Priority | Area | Tier | Rationale for Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Global Institutional Reform** | Tier 1 | **Foundation for all other action.** Without legitimate, effective, and trusted global institutions (UN, etc.), implementing any other framework becomes nearly impossible. This is the bedrock. | Done as the 'Treaty for Our Only Home'
| **2** | **Global Health Equity & Pandemic Governance** | Tier 1 | **Immediate existential threat.** Addresses the clear and present danger of global pandemics and the underlying health inequities that exacerbate such crises. High urgency and massive human impact. | To be integrated with the Planetary Health framework
| **3** | **Global Supply Chains & Logistics** | Tier 1 | **Immediate systemic vulnerability.** Recent years have shown that fragile supply chains can cripple the global economy, block access to essential goods like food and medicine, and create widespread instability. |
| **4** | **Energy Transition Governance** | Tier 1 | **Urgent climate imperative.** Directly linked to the most pressing aspects of climate change. A just and rapid energy transition is critical to preventing catastrophic environmental tipping points. |
| **5** | **Synthetic Biology & Neurotechnology Governance** | Tier 1 | **High-risk emerging technology.** These fields pose profound ethical questions and potential irreversible risks to what it means to be human. The governance gap is widening extremely fast. *(Merged "Synthetic Biology" and "Neurotechnology & Cognitive Rights" for a unified focus on high-stakes biotech).* |
| **6** | **Global Data Governance & Sovereignty** | Tier 1 | **Core infrastructure of the modern world.** Data and AI are now central to economics, security, and social discourse. The lack of governance is creating immense friction and risk. |
| **7** | **Transnational Crime & Global Security** | Tier 1 | **Erosion of state stability.** Illicit networks actively undermine legitimate governance, peace, and economic development. A direct threat to the stability required for progress in other areas. |
| **8** | **Cybersecurity & Digital Infrastructure** | Tier 2 | **Protection of critical systems.** Closely linked to #6 and #7, this focuses on protecting the essential digital arteries of global society from collapse or weaponization. |
| **9** | **Global Trade & Resource Governance** | Tier 1 | **Prevents resource-based conflict.** As demand for strategic resources (rare earths, water) grows, the potential for conflict increases. This is a foundational issue for long-term peace. |
| **10** | **Soil Health & Land Use Governance** | Tier 2 | **Foundation of food systems.** Degraded soil and poor land use threaten global food security and biodiversity. It's a slower-moving crisis than a pandemic, but just as fundamental. |
| **11** | **Global Public Goods** | Tier 1 | **Core principle of cooperation.** While lower in priority as a *new* framework (as it's a meta-concept), formalizing its principles is key to justifying and funding action in many other areas. |
| **12** | **Arctic & Polar Governance** | Tier 4 | **Emerging geopolitical hotspot.** The melting of polar ice is opening new shipping lanes and resource access, creating a new arena for great power competition and ecological devastation. High urgency in a specific domain. |
| **13** | **Waste & Circular Economy** | Tier 2 | **Addresses a key planetary boundary.** The "take-make-waste" model is unsustainable. A circular economy framework is essential for long-term ecological and economic health. |
| **14** | **Media Integrity & Global Epistemic Integrity** | Tier 3 | **Foundation of shared reality.** Without a baseline of trusted information and a shared understanding of reality, democratic processes and international cooperation break down. *(Merged for focus).* |
| **15** | **Post-Growth & Degrowth Economics** | Tier 2 | **Fundamental paradigm shift.** Explores necessary alternatives to an economic model that is hitting planetary limits. Essential for long-term sustainability but requires significant foundational work. |
| **16** | **Public Participation & Transnational Democracy** | Tier 2/3 | **Enhances legitimacy and effectiveness.** New models of democracy are needed to build public trust and buy-in for global initiatives. Supports #1. *(Merged for focus).* |
| **17** | **Care Work & Informal Economies** | Tier 3 | **Addresses a massive blind spot.** This work, largely done by women, is foundational to all economic activity but remains unmeasured and unsupported. A key issue for equity. |
| **18** | **Intellectual Property & Knowledge Sharing** | Tier 2 | **Reduces global inequity.** The current IP regime often hinders access to critical knowledge and technology for developing nations. Important for justice and global development. |
| **19** | **Global Nutrition & Diets** | Tier 2 | **Critical health and food system link.** Addresses the "slow pandemic" of malnutrition and diet-related disease, a major factor in overall global health and equity. |
| **20** | **Transportation & Mobility** | Tier 2 | **Key for decarbonization and equity.** Governance of global transport is essential for meeting climate goals and ensuring equitable access to economic opportunities. |
| **21** | **Human-Nature Relationship** | Tier 2 | **Cultural and ethical underpinning.** This framework addresses the root cultural narratives that drive environmental destruction. It's a deep, long-term project essential for lasting change. |
| **22** | **Creative Rights & Artistic Futures** | Tier 3 | **Nurtures cultural resilience.** Protects a fundamental human right and supports the creation of new narratives and "myth-making" needed for societal transformation. |
| **23** | **Tourism & Cultural Exchange** | Tier 3 | **Balances economic activity with preservation.** A more specific framework that addresses the tangible impacts of global mobility on local cultures and ecosystems. |
| **24** | **Long-Term Interstellar Governance** | Tier 4 | **Visionary & future-proofing.** While not immediately urgent, establishing ethical principles now for humanity's long-term future in space is a matter of profound foresight. |
| **25** | **Time & Measurement Standards** | Tier 4 | **Fundamental but stable.** While critical, the global systems for coordinating time and standards are relatively robust and less in crisis than other areas. |
