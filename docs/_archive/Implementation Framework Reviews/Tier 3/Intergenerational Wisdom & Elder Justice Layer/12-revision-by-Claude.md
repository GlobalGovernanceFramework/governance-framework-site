# Enhanced Global Governance Framework for Aging Population Support

## Executive Summary
**Vision**: Transform aging from a societal burden into a cornerstone of thriving communities through dignity, purpose, and intergenerational connection.

**Core Innovation**: Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) that rewards elder contributions + meaningful occupation rights + nested support systems that work from local to global scales.
