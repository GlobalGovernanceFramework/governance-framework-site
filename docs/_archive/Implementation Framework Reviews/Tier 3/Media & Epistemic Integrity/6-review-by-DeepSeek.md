  - Tiered system elegantly prioritizes interventions.  
  - "Economic Incentives" as cross-tier driver is perceptive.  
- **Suggestions:**  
  - Add **"Tier -1: Long-Term Cognitive Erosion"** (e.g., attention economy impacts on critical thinking).

  - "Algorithmic choice" (e.g., chronological/serendipity feeds) empowers users.  
  - Epistemic circuit breakers are a pragmatic crisis tool.  
- **Suggestions:**  
  - Mandate **"Ad Algorithm Transparency"** (e.g., real-time disclosure of political ad targeting).  

#### **Pillar 4 (Digital Public Square):**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Bridging Dialogues and Citizen Assemblies are evidence-based.  
  - Cultural adaptability is a standout feature.  
- **Suggestions:**  
  - Include **"Decentralized Moderation"** models (e.g., community juries for content disputes).  

#### **Pillar 5 (Epistemic Justice):**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Global Restitution Fund addresses tangible harms.  
  - Truth and reconciliation protocols are ethically robust.  
- **Suggestions:**

#### **Pillar 6 (Crisis Response):**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Integration with Treaty enforcement ensures scalability.  
  - Scenario planning anticipates emerging threats.  
- **Suggestions:**  
  - Add **"AI Deepfake Watermarking"** as a mandatory standard.  

### **6. Implementation Roadmap (Grade: 92/100)**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Phased scaling (10 → 50 → 100+ institutions) is pragmatic.  
  - Longitudinal tracking (e.g., polarization metrics) ensures accountability.  
- **Suggestions:**  
  - Include **"Youth Ambassador Programs"** to drive peer-to-peer media literacy.  
  - Add **"Anti-Corruption Safeguards"** for Trustmark auditing.  

### **7. Governance & Funding (Grade: 94/100)**

- **Suggestions:**  
  - Add **"Disinformation Stress Tests"** (e.g., war-game scenarios for Rapid Response Teams).  

### **9. Resource Scaling (Grade: 90/100)**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Budget projections are detailed and plausible.  
  - 5:1 ROI claim is ambitious but defensible.  
- **Suggestions:**
