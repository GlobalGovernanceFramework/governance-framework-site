- Regular audit requirements and public reporting standards

### **3. Authoritarian Context Strategies**
**Current Gap**: Covert training modules mentioned but underdeveloped
**Recommendation**:
- Digital rights education through cultural and artistic channels
- Secure communication protocols for epistemic resistance networks
- International support mechanisms for independent media in restrictive contexts

### **4. Cross-Cultural Adaptation**
**Current Gap**: Limited discussion of cultural epistemological diversity
**Recommendation**:
- Indigenous knowledge integration protocols
- Adaptation frameworks for different cultural contexts
- Multi-cultural deliberation methodologies

### **5. Resource Scaling Analysis**
**Current Gap**: Resource requirements for global implementation unclear
**Recommendation**:
- Detailed budget projections for each pillar
- Cost-benefit analysis for different implementation strategies
- Funding gap analysis and alternative revenue mechanisms
