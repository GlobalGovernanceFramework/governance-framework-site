# Youth & Intergenerational Global Governance Framework Outline

## 1. Vision
To create a global governance system that equitably represents and empowers all generations, particularly youth and future generations, ensuring sustainable, inclusive, and forward-thinking decision-making.

## 2. Core Principles
- **Intergenerational Justice**: Policies must prioritize long-term well-being for current and future generations.
- **Youth Empowerment**: Young people (ages 16-30) are equal co-architects in governance, with binding decision-making power.
- **Transparency & Accountability**: Governance processes are open, with mechanisms to hold leaders accountable across generations.
- **Inclusivity**: Representation reflects diverse global perspectives, especially from marginalized and underrepresented groups.
- **Foresight-Driven**: Decisions are informed by predictive modeling and long-term impact assessments.

## 3. Key Components

### 3.1 Global Youth Assembly (GYA)
- **Structure**: A permanent, democratically elected body within the UN, comprising youth representatives (ages 16-30) from every member state.
- **Powers**:
  - Weighted voting or veto power on long-term policies (e.g., climate, AI governance, space law).
  - Ability to propose and co-draft international treaties.
- **Rotation System**: Representatives serve 2-year terms, with mandatory turnover to ensure fresh perspectives.
- **Implementation**:
  - Establish electoral processes via national youth councils and digital voting platforms.
  - Secure funding through UN budgets and member state contributions.

### 3.2 Intergenerational Impact Assessments (IIAs)
- **Purpose**: Evaluate the long-term (50+ years) consequences of major policies and laws.
- **Process**:
  - Mandatory for all UN resolutions, national legislation, and corporate strategies.
  - Uses AI-powered predictive modeling to simulate impacts on future generations.
- **Oversight**: Conducted by independent panels of youth, experts, and "Future Guardians" (see 3.3).
- **Implementation**:
  - Develop standardized IIA protocols, inspired by environmental impact assessments.
  - Integrate with existing UN and national policy review processes.

### 3.3 Guardians of the Future
- **Role**: Independent ombudsman offices at national and UN levels to advocate for future generations.
- **Powers**:
  - Legal standing to challenge policies in national and international courts.
  - Authority to publish binding recommendations.
- **Model**: Expands on Wales’ Future Generations Commissioner with global enforcement mechanisms.
- **Implementation**:
  - Establish national offices through legislation, coordinated by a UN-level Future Generations Commissioner.
  - Fund via global "Future Generations Fund" (see 3.6).

### 3.4 Digital Democracy Platforms
- **Purpose**: Enable youth to participate in global governance through secure, decentralized systems.
- **Features**:
  - Blockchain-based voting via digital IDs for key global issues.
  - AI-assisted deliberative platforms for consensus-building, with real-time fact-checking and bias mitigation.
- **Implementation**:
  - Partner with tech organizations to develop open-source platforms.
  - Pilot in select regions before global rollout.

### 3.5 Reverse Mentorship & Intergenerational Councils
- **Reverse Mentorship**:
  - Mandatory advisory roles for youth (under 30) on government and corporate executive boards.
  - Focus on sustainability, tech ethics, and social equity.
- **Intergenerational Councils**:
  - Structured dialogues between youth and elders to co-design policies.
  - Hosted at national and UN levels.
- **Implementation**:
  - Legislate mandatory youth representation in decision-making bodies.
  - Create council frameworks with clear mandates and timelines.

### 3.6 Global Climate & Biodiversity Debt Mechanism
- **Purpose**: Address historical environmental harm by redistributing resources to youth-led sustainability initiatives.
- **Structure**:
  - Wealthy nations and corporations contribute to a "Future Generations Fund."
  - Funds allocated to youth-led projects via competitive grants.
- **Legal Framework**:
  - Recognize "ecocide" as an international crime, with youth plaintiffs in global courts.
- **Implementation**:
  - Establish fund through UN-backed agreements.
  - Create international legal pathways for ecocide prosecutions.

### 3.7 Decentralized Governance Experiments
- **Liquid Democracy Pilots**:
  - Allow citizens (especially youth) to delegate votes to experts or vote directly via apps.
- **Policy Hackathons**:
  - Global competitions for youth to draft governance models for emerging technologies (AI, gene editing, space colonization).
- **Implementation**:
  - Launch pilots in progressive nations or cities.
  - Scale successful models through UN partnerships.

### 3.8 Universal Civic Education & Future Literacy
- **Curriculum**:
  - Mandatory global courses on systems thinking, global governance, and foresight.
  - UN-backed "Future Simulations" for students to negotiate international treaties.
- **Implementation**:
  - Integrate into national education systems via UNESCO partnerships.
  - Develop open-access online modules.

### 3.9 Time Capsule Diplomacy
- **Purpose**: Hold leaders accountable by documenting their justifications for decisions.
- **Process**:
  - Leaders write letters to future generations, archived globally.
  - Letters revisited after 20-50 years for public review.
- **Implementation**:
  - Create a UN-managed digital archive.
  - Mandate participation for heads of state and corporate leaders.

### 3.10 Intergenerational Justice in the UN Charter
- **Goal**: Amend the UN Charter to recognize the rights of future generations.
- **Precedent**: Builds on the UN’s Right to a Healthy Environment resolution.
- **Implementation**:
  - Propose amendment through UN General Assembly.
  - Build global consensus via youth-led advocacy campaigns.

## 4. Radical Proposals for Consideration
- **Global Voting Age of 16**: Lower voting age for all elections to increase youth influence.
- **Sunset Clauses on Laws**: Policies expire unless re-approved by youth-inclusive reviews.
- **Wealth & Power Caps**: Limit terms or ages in leadership to prevent gerontocratic dominance.

## 5. Implementation Roadmap
1. **Year 1-2**: Pilot GYA, IIAs, and digital democracy platforms in select regions.
2. **Year 3-5**: Establish Guardians of the Future and Future Generations Fund globally.
3. **Year 6-10**: Integrate intergenerational justice into UN Charter and national governance systems.
4. **Ongoing**: Scale civic education, policy hackathons, and time capsule diplomacy.

## 6. Next Steps for globalgovernanceframework.org
- **Review**: Grade each component for feasibility, impact, and inclusivity.
- **Revise**: Refine based on stakeholder feedback (youth, policymakers, experts).
- **Advocacy**: Launch campaigns to promote framework adoption at national and UN levels.
- **Partnerships**: Collaborate with UNESCO, UNEP, and youth organizations for implementation.
