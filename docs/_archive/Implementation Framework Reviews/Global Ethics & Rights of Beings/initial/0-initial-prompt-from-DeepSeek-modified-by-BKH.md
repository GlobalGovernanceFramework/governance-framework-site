Björn Kenneth Holmström:
"Develop an outline for a Global Ethics & Human Rights framework that:  
1. Integrates Spiral Dynamics (e.g., valuing all worldviews but prioritizing life-affirming tiers), facilitating the world's eventual progress up the spiral, with the positive aspects of each stage emphasized and cherished and enabling resolution of the most prominent stage clashes.
2. Addresses tensions between universal rights and cultural autonomy.  
3. Includes enforcement mechanisms beyond nation-states (e.g., citizen assemblies, AI audits).  
4. Aligns with the UN SDGs but critiques their limitations.  
Structure:  
- Preamble (Core Values)  
- Meta-Principles (e.g., 'Rights of Nature' alongside human rights)  
- Governance Architecture  
- Conflict Resolution Protocols  
- Metrics for Success"
