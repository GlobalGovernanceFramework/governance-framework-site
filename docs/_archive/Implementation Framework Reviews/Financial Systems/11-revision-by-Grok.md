# Financial Systems Framework Outline for Global Governance

## Introduction: Financial Systems as the Nervous System of Value Flow
Financial systems orchestrate the flow of resources, trust, and value, acting as the nervous system of the global economy. Beyond transactions, they encode what we value—profit, purpose, or planetary wellbeing. This framework reimagines financial systems to prioritize human and ecological flourishing, integrating diverse currencies of value (love, care, connection) with robust governance, equitable access, practical transition pathways, and *Hearts* as a global coordinating currency. A system dynamics map illustrates feedback loops between components, ensuring resilient and adaptive value flows.

[Visual Description]: A system dynamics map showing feedback loops: 
- *Hearts* circulation reinforces Love Ledger participation.
- Care contributions increase AUBI payouts, driving community engagement.
- Global Commons Council governance stabilizes hybrid systems.
- Equity mechanisms reduce disparities, enhancing trust in *Hearts*.

## 1. Reimagining Value & Trust
**Objective**: Redefine wealth to encompass human, ecological, and relational wellbeing.  
- **From Profit to Purpose**: Financial systems grounded in human and planetary wellbeing.  
  - Draw on *Sacred Economics* (Charles Eisenstein), emphasizing shared value stories.  
  - Trust as a foundational currency, validated by community and technology.  
- **Alternative Trust Systems**:  
  - Mutual credit networks (e.g., Sardex in Italy, 80% transaction retention in local economies).  
  - Time banks (e.g., TimeRepublik, 10K+ users globally).  
  - Reputation-based micro-lending (e.g., Kiva, $2B+ disbursed).  
  - Care economies with "interbeing tokens."  
- **Success Metrics**:  
  - Participation rates (e.g., 30% community adoption in pilots).  
  - Social impact (e.g., 15% wellbeing score increase in pilot communities).  
  - Inequality reduction (e.g., 5% Gini coefficient drop).  
- **Case Studies with Baseline Data**:  
  - Andean time banks: 500 participants, 20% poverty reduction.  
  - Buddhist *dana* economies: 1,000+ transactions in Thailand pilot.  
  - Zakat-inspired mutual aid: $1M redistributed in Pakistan pilot.  

## 2. Plural Financial Infrastructures
