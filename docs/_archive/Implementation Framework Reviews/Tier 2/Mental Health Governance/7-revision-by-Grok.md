# Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health Governance

## Executive Summary
This framework, titled the **Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health**, establishes a rights-based, inclusive, and adaptive global approach to mental health governance, prioritizing psychosocial flourishing, equity, and planetary well-being. Key priorities include:
