- **Goals:** Eliminate poverty, validate care and ecological work, promote cultural and spiritual flourishing, ensure reparative justice, and foster resilient societies in Right Relationship with the planet.
- **Key Features:**
  - Four-tiered payout structure, with Layer 0 as the philosophical foundation honoring relational wealth.
  - Financing via automation taxes, resource levies, Commons Dividends, and Hearts/Leaves, stabilized by Treaty’s Pillar 4.
  - Governance via **Social Resilience Council** under Meta-Governance, with Earth Council veto power.
  - LMCI rooted in Right Relationship, measuring human-land connections.
  - Crisis protocols coordinated by Meta-Governance, with Indigenous-led recovery.
  - Cultural adaptation with Indigenous sovereignty, FPIC 2.0, and Red Lines Clause.
- **Risks:** Gaming, digital divide, capital flight, cultural conflicts, mitigated through Indigenous-guided governance, AI audits, and community validation.
- **Readiness:** Ready for pilot development in Indigenous-led Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), stakeholder engagement, and global coalition building.

**Changes**:
- Reframed AUBI as an expression of the Treaty and Indigenous wisdom.
- Positioned Hearts/Leaves as the regenerative economy’s lifeblood.

## **2. Introduction: AUBI as the Heart of a Regenerative Civilization**

### **2.1. A Foundation for Right Relationship**
Guided by the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework**, AUBI is the economic engine for the Treaty’s social contract, ensuring economic security while nurturing **Right Relationship**—the interconnected web of human, non-human, and planetary life. It unlocks potential for innovation, community flourishing, and cultural revitalization, aligned with STR-206.

**Right Relationship Defined:**
- **Economic Security:** Freedom from survival anxiety via a hybrid fiat/Hearts baseline.
- **Relational Wealth:** Prioritizing kinship, community, and ecological harmony (Layer 0).
- **Restorative Justice:** Reparations for historical and ecological harms (Layer 3).
- **Planetary Flourishing:** Contributions to care, culture, and ecology, rewarded by Hearts/Leaves.

**Historical Inspirations:** Indigenous gift economies, Alaska Permanent Fund, Brazil’s Bolsa Família, Finland’s UBI pilot, Kenya’s GiveDirectly, reimagined through Indigenous wisdom for global scalability.

### **2.2. AUBI vs. Traditional UBI**
AUBI is not a welfare policy but a living system for enacting Treaty promises, channeling Hearts/Leaves through the Love Ledger, and guided by Indigenous principles.

| **Feature** | **Traditional UBI** | **Adaptive UBI (AUBI)** |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Philosophy** | Welfare supplement | Expression of Right Relationship and Treaty social contract |
| **Payout** | Fixed fiat | Hybrid fiat/Hearts baseline, dynamic bonuses, Leaves for ecology |
| **Conditionality** | Unconditional | Unconditional baseline + voluntary contributions for Hearts/Leaves |
| **Metrics** | Poverty reduction | LMCI (Right Relationship, care, ecology, culture) |
| **Governance** | State-based | Social Resilience Council under Meta-Governance, Earth Council veto |
| **Cultural Approach** | Universal | Indigenous-guided, community-adapted with FPIC 2.0 |

### **2.3. The Guiding Compass: Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**
LMCI measures flourishing through **Right Relationship**, replacing GDP with metrics of human-land connection, care, and cultural vitality, guided by Indigenous wisdom.

**LMCI Components:**
- **Love (Care & Relationships):** Care hours, mentorship, social cohesion, validated by communities.
- **Meaning (Purpose & Growth):** Cultural preservation, knowledge sharing, spiritual flourishing.
- **Connection (Human-Land Harmony):** Ecological stewardship, sacred site health, community storytelling.

**Transition Strategy:** LMCI complements GDP for 5 years, with studies showing 7-12% productivity gains from enhanced wellbeing.

**Changes**:
- Reframed AUBI as the Treaty’s economic engine, rooted in Right Relationship.
- Redefined LMCI to emphasize human-land connections, aligning with Indigenous philosophy.
- Positioned Layer 0 as the foundation for relational wealth.

|--------------------|-------------------|----------------|-----------------------|
| **Financing** | P4 (Planetary Health) | Carbon taxes, Leaves for restoration, Hearts stabilization | Emergency funding via P4 |
| **Verification** | P2 (Global Forensic Corps) | Love Ledger validation, fraud prevention | Crisis evidence analysis |
| **Implementation** | P1 (Reform Accelerator Labs) | Pilot testing in BAZs, legislative templates | Rapid policy adaptation |
