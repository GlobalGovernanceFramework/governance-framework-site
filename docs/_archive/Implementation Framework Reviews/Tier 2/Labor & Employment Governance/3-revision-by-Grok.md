# Work in Liberation: A Radical Labour & Employment Governance Framework

## Introduction: Redefining Labour for a Post-Work Future
**Vision**: *"From exploited labour to liberated work—where every act of labour honours dignity, nurtures community, and regenerates the planet, transcending compulsory employment for voluntary, life-centered contributions."*

This framework reimagines labour as a voluntary expression of human potential within thriving ecological communities. It integrates **post-capitalist labour models**, **disability justice** (Radical Disability Rights Framework, filename: 11-revision-by-Grok.md), **Indigenous sovereignty** (Financial Systems Framework, filename: 22-revision-by-Grok.md), and **ecological regeneration**, building on *Hearts* currency, Love Ledger (Financial Systems Framework), Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) (Aging Population Support Framework, filename: 13-revision-by-Claude.md), and Bioregional Autonomy Zones (BAZs) (Indigenous Framework). New innovations from the Post-Work Framework (filename: 2-further-ideas-from-Björn-Kenenth-Holmström-and-DeepSeek.md) include the **Post-Labor Transition Protocol**, **Contribution Ecosystems**, **Planetary Stewardship Index**, **Autonomous Worker Syndicates**, and **AI-Human Symbiosis Framework**, aiming to phase out wage slavery by 2050.

**Visual Aid**:  
- **Description**: A spiral infographic illustrating labour liberation stages:  
  - **Inner Ring**: "Survival Labour" (wage slavery, exploitation).  
  - **Middle Ring**: "Sovereign Labour" (AUBI, *Hearts*, Contribution Ecosystems).  
  - **Outer Ring**: "Life-Making Labour" (ecosocial harmony, planetary stewardship).  
- **Implementation**: Interactive digital version on `workinliberation.org/spiral` (launch Q2 2026), with SVG downloads for advocacy, including icons for Contribution Ecosystems and Planetary Stewardship.

## 1. Core Principles
1. **Labour as Life-Making**  
   - Redefine "work" as **care, creativity, and ecological stewardship**, tracked via *Hearts* and Love Ledger (Financial Systems Framework, Section 3).  
   - **Decouple survival from wage labour** through AUBI with contribution multipliers (Aging Framework, Section 1.1; Post-Work Framework, Section 2.1).  

2. **Sovereignty Over Time & Body**  
   - **Right to refuse work** without penalty, including accommodations for disability (*Crip Time*, Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 2) and climate strike protections.  
   - Mandate **4-day workweeks** by 2030, with flexible scheduling (*Crip Time*) and a **15-hour/week contribution ceiling** for voluntary stewardship (Post-Work Framework, Section 6.1).  

3. **Plural Economies of Value**  
   - **Hybrid compensation**: Combine fiat, *Hearts*, and *Leaves* (Financial Systems Framework, Section 12.1) (e.g., 50% fiat, 30% *Hearts*, 20% care/ecological credits).  
   - **Indigenous labour protocols**: Incorporate *ayni* (reciprocal labour) and potlatch (gift economies) (Financial Systems Framework, Section 1.1).  
   - **Contribution Pluralism**: Recognize diverse value creation (e.g., care, knowledge sharing, creative expression) via Contribution Ecosystems (Post-Work Framework, Section 3.2).  

4. **Post-Human Solidarity**  
   - Tax **AI and robot labour** (30% productivity gains) to fund AUBI (Financial Systems Framework, Section 15; Post-Work Framework, Section 2.1).  
   - Grant **non-human labour rights**, such as ecosystem personhood with mandated "rest" periods (Indigenous Framework).  
   - Implement **AI-Human Symbiosis Protocols** to ensure AI serves human-defined values (Post-Work Framework, Section 4.2).  

5. **Abolition of Exploitative Systems**  
   - **Phase out gig economies** by 2035, replacing with **worker-owned platforms** like Sardex cooperatives (Financial Systems Framework, Section 1).  
   - **Ban prison labour**, transitioning to restorative justice economies led by elder councils (Aging Framework, Section 2.2).  
   - **Sunset extractive industries** (e.g., fossil fuels by 2030, fast fashion by 2032) via Just Transition Protocols (Post-Work Framework, Section 3.1).  

## 2. Structural Components
### 2.1 Global Labour Assembly (GLA)
- **Composition**: 50% workers (formal/informal), 30% marginalized groups (disabled, Indigenous, migrant), 20% AI observers trained on labour justice principles (Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 3.1).  
- **Powers**:  
  - Veto exploitative trade deals.  
  - Set **global labour standards** (e.g., 20:1 CEO-worker pay ratio).  
  - Govern *Hearts* labour exchanges (e.g., 1 hour childcare = 50 *Leaves*, Financial Systems Framework, Section 12.1).  
  - Oversee **Planetary Stewardship Markets** (e.g., Soil Generation Bonds, Post-Work Framework, Section 2.3).  
- **Governance**: Use **Neural Democracy Interface** for real-time preference aggregation (Post-Work Framework, Section 4.2).  
- **Visual Aid**:  
  - **Prompt**: A flowchart showing GLA structure: central GLA node branching to worker councils, marginalized group representatives, AI observers, and Planetary Stewardship Markets, with arrows for veto power and *Hearts* allocation.

### 2.2 Bioregional Work Councils (BWCs)
- **Role**: Coordinate labour within Bioregional Autonomy Zones (BAZs) (Indigenous Framework), including:  
  - **Land-back cooperatives**: Indigenous-led sustainable agriculture.  
  - **Care collectives**: Disability-led mutual aid networks (Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 3.5).  
  - **Autonomous Worker Syndicates**: Self-organizing, blockchain-enabled collectives (5-50 people) for regenerative activities (Post-Work Framework, Section 2.2).  
- **Tools**:  
  - **Labour Matching App**: Open-source platform for skill-sharing, integrated with *Hearts* and **Skill Resonance Matching** (Financial Systems Framework, Section 3; Post-Work Framework, Section 2.2).  
  - **Planetary Stewardship Index**: Rates jobs by ecological impact (e.g., biodiversity, soil health), targeting 70% workforce in regenerative activities by 2040 (Post-Work Framework, Section 8.1).  
- **Visual Aid**:  
  - **Prompt**: A network diagram of BWCs: nodes for land-back cooperatives, care collectives, Autonomous Worker Syndicates, and Labour Matching App, connected by *Hearts*, *Leaves*, and Stewardship Credits.

### 2.3 Adaptive Labour Contracts
- **Flexible Templates**:  
  - **Seasonal work**: Align with ecological cycles (e.g., fishing bans during spawning).  
  - **Project-based**: Self-determined hours for artists, caregivers, and neurodiverse workers (*Crip Time*, Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 20).  
  - **Contribution Ecosystems**: Fluid, voluntary activities (e.g., care, ecological stewardship, creative expression) with dynamic compensation (Post-Work Framework, Section 3.2).  
- **AI Co-Design**: Workers train algorithms for fair contracts, adhering to **Creativity Parity** standards (Post-Work Framework, Section 4.2).  

### 2.4 Reparative Economies
- **Colonialism Repair Bonds**: Tax corporations 5% of profits for Indigenous land rematriation and Black cooperative startups (Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 2).  
- **Care-weighted AUBI**: Extra *Hearts* for historically unpaid labour (e.g., +20% for care work, +30% for ecological restoration, +50% for intergenerational knowledge transmission, Post-Work Framework, Section 2.1).  
- **Reparations Fund**: 15% of AUBI funding from historical labour exploitation reparations (Post-Work Framework, Section 2.1).  

### 2.5 Work Dispute Systems
- **Labour Courts**:  
  - **AI mediators** (bias-audited, Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 5) and worker juries, using **Algorithmic Contribution Audit** for transparency (Post-Work Framework, Section 4.2).  
  - Enforce rulings via *Hearts* sanctions or **Crypto-Enabled Treasury** adjustments (Financial Systems Framework, Section 7; Post-Work Framework, Section 2.2).  
- **Visual Aid**:  
  - **Prompt**: A workflow diagram: "Dispute Reported" → "AI Mediation" → "Worker Jury Ruling" → "*Hearts* Sanctions or Treasury Adjustment."
