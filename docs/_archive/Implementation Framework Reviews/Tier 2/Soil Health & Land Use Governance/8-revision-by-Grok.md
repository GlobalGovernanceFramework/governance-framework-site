# Soil Health & Land Use Governance Framework

**Tier:** 2 (Systems for Long-Term Thriving)  
**Status:** Final Revised Draft Outline  

---

### Plain Language Summary

Healthy soil is not just dirt—it's a living, breathing system that feeds life. This framework helps the world shift from taking from the land to giving back—so all people, plants, and animals can thrive together.

---

### Framework Position within the Golden Triangle

The Soil Health & Land Use Governance Framework is empowered by the *Treaty* through enforceable mechanisms such as bans on soil-degrading chemicals, the Land Rematriation Tribunal under Pillar 3, and trade sanctions for non-compliance. It is guided by the *Indigenous Framework*, embedding Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) as the foundation for regenerative agriculture and soil health practices. The *Meta-Governance Framework* coordinates alignment across Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), resolving conflicts and ensuring consistency with global sustainability goals, including the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), climate targets, the *Biodiversity Framework* for ecological feedback loops, the *Planetary Health Framework* for soil-human health reciprocity, and the *Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) Framework* to monetize ecological contributions. The *Aurora Accord* ensures data sovereignty for soil-related knowledge, protecting TEK and community data.

### Vision: Land as Relation, Not Commodity

To reframe humanity's relationship with land and soil, shifting from an extractive, property-based model to a regenerative, stewardship-based model where soil is treated as a living, sacred commons essential for all life.

---

### Core Principles

- **Soil as a Living Commons:** Soil is not private property to be depleted but a shared, living entity with a right to be healthy, aligned with "Rights of Nature" legal frameworks (e.g., Ecuador, New Zealand).  
- **Subsoil Rights:** Protects deep soil layers and minerals from extractive industries (e.g., mining, fracking) to preserve long-term soil integrity.  
- **Bioregional Governance:** Land use decisions are made at the watershed and ecosystem level through BAZs, superseding arbitrary political boundaries, while meeting a Minimum Regenerative Threshold for global consistency.  
- **Land Rematriation & Restorative Justice:** Prioritizes returning land to Indigenous stewardship, creating mechanisms for cultural healing, reparations, and stewardship reparations for Indigenous communities managing rematriated lands. Addresses colonial land grabs, extractive export agriculture, and debt traps in Global South regions through debt-for-regeneration swaps and sovereignty-respecting aid programs, while including non-Indigenous landless populations (e.g., tenant farmers, displaced urban communities) in restorative justice.  
- **Regenerative by Default:** Mandates that all land use practices actively improve soil health, water cycles, and biodiversity, including predator-prey and microbial food web relationships.  
- **Food & Water Sovereignty:** Ensures local communities control their food and water sources, integrating urban-rural linkages (e.g., urban agriculture, rooftop gardens).  
- **Intergenerational Equity:** Ensures the voices of youth and future generations are included in land use governance through youth delegations in Bioregional Land Councils.  
- **Post-Ownership Stewardship:** Land stewardship may evolve beyond legal ownership models toward shared responsibility systems rooted in ecological and relational ethics.  
- **Soil-Human Health Reciprocity:** Recognizes the direct link between healthy soils, nutrient-dense food, and human health, fostering practices that enhance this reciprocal relationship.

### Structural Components

- **Global Soil Health Monitoring Service:** A decentralized network using satellites, local sensors, and TEK to provide a real-time "state of the world's soils" dashboard. Operates within the *Global Data Commons Trust* under the *Aurora Accord* to ensure data privacy (e.g., anonymizing sensitive TEK unless consent is given). Tracks metrics like carbon sequestration rates, soil organic matter, microbial diversity, mycorrhizal density, fungal health, social equity indicators (e.g., land rematriation progress, food sovereignty levels), cultural indicators (e.g., revival of Indigenous land-based languages, ceremonies), and avoided harm (e.g., reduced pesticide-related illnesses). Integrates with the *Planetary Health Framework* for joint soil-human health dashboards.  
- **Bioregional Land & Food Councils:** Governance bodies within each BAZ responsible for creating and enforcing local land use plans consistent with Accord principles and a Minimum Regenerative Threshold. Councils include Indigenous-led review processes, youth delegations, and citizen-led participatory land futures modeling (e.g., open scenario tools, citizen juries). Councils validate regenerative activities for *AUBI* Layer 2 Contributions, prioritizing TEK-based practices for higher *Hearts* currency rewards, with mechanisms to ensure access for small-scale farmers and Indigenous stewards (e.g., low-tech participation options).  
- **Land Rematriation & Justice Tribunal:** A specialized body under the *Treaty’s* Pillar 3 to adjudicate historical land claims, oversee restorative justice processes, facilitate cultural healing ceremonies, and provide long-term stewardship reparations for Indigenous communities. Includes provisions for Global South contexts addressing colonial legacies, debt-related dispossession, and non-Indigenous landless populations.  
- **Global Regenerative Agriculture Fund:** Funded by the *Treaty’s* Pillar 4, providing resources for farmers transitioning to regenerative practices, including tiered subsidies (higher for early adopters), peer-to-peer mentorship, and a Corporate Transition Pathway with tax breaks for agribusinesses shifting to regenerative supply chains. Issues green bonds to attract private investment and collaborates with the *Planetary Health Framework* for cross-framework funding pools tied to health outcomes. Supports a BAZ Seed Fund for resource-constrained communities.  
- **Knowledge Commons Platform:** A global platform for sharing TEK-based regenerative practices, co-managed by Indigenous councils and scientists under the *Aurora Accord* to ensure Indigenous Data Sovereignty, community consent, and data fiduciary standards. Includes a Soil Innovation Lab to pilot emergent practices (e.g., biochar, mycoremediation) and a Soil Storytelling Initiative to document land-healing narratives (e.g., Māori guardianship models). Links urban rooftop gardens to rural seed banks. Soil memory is not only biological—it is cultural. Through story, ceremony, and science, we remember how to care for land. The Knowledge Commons honors both ancestral traditions and emergent ecological science, weaving them into an intergenerational tapestry of practices that evolve with the land itself.  
- **Crisis Response Mechanism:** A rapid-response team to address soil degradation hotspots (e.g., desertification, post-industrial land) with tailored restoration strategies, including transboundary coordination across BAZs for shared challenges like desertification corridors or migratory dust storm patterns. Supports climate refugee resettlement by restoring degraded lands for displaced communities.

### Key Mechanisms

- **The Global Soil Health Accord:** A binding international agreement enforcing regenerative practices and phasing out soil-degrading chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Violations trigger fines, trade sanctions, or restorative justice processes via the *Treaty*. Ties soil carbon sequestration to national climate commitments under the *Treaty* (e.g., soil credits in carbon markets).  
- **Regenerative Agriculture Mandates:** A phased global transition to regenerative practices, supported by tiered subsidies, peer-to-peer mentorship, international farmer networks, and a Corporate Transition Pathway. Independent certification systems, co-developed with Indigenous councils, require public disclosure of audits to prevent greenwashing and penalize "checkbook regeneration" with *Treaty*-backed trade sanctions.  
- **Land Value & Anti-Speculation Tax:** A tax on the unimproved value of land, enforced globally via the *Treaty’s* trade leverage and standardized protocols to prevent evasion, discouraging speculative hoarding and incentivizing regenerative use.  
- **Community Land Trusts & Food Commons:** Legal and financial support for communities to hold land in common for food production, ecosystem restoration, housing, rewilded zones, sacred sites, and cultural landscapes as living libraries of soil restoration and biocultural memory.  
- **Soil Health Education Mandate:** Integrates soil literacy into global school curricula, overseen by the *Indigenous Framework*, to foster widespread understanding of soil as a living commons.  
- **Urban Soil Health Integration:** Policies to promote urban agriculture (e.g., rooftop gardens, urban soil restoration) with benchmarks for the percentage of city land managed regeneratively, linked to rural seed banks via the Knowledge Commons.  
- **Nutrient Density & Food Quality Verification:** In partnership with the *Planetary Health Framework*, tracks nutrient density of food from high-health-score soils, with "Planetary Health Certified" labels for regenerative BAZ products to enhance market and public health benefits.  
- **The Right to Ecological Repair:** Guarantees communities access to resources (e.g., open-source TEK, native seed banks) and protection from corporate patents on remediation technologies, aligning with the *Right to Repair Mandate*. Includes legal aid for communities fighting corporate land grabs.

### Implementation Pathways

- **Phased Rollout:**  
  - **Short-Term (1–5 years):** Pilot BAZs selected via a Readiness Assessment (e.g., Indigenous governance strength, soil degradation urgency, political willingness), supported by a BAZ Seed Fund. Test governance, monitoring, *AUBI* integration, and farmer cooperation systems.  
  - **Medium-Term (5–15 years):** Regional adoption of BAZs, scaling successful pilots, refining enforcement mechanisms, and addressing resistance through tiered subsidies, mentorship, and corporate incentives.  
  - **Long-Term (15+ years):** Global scaling, fully integrating with the *Treaty*, *Meta-Governance Framework*, *Biodiversity Framework*, *AUBI Framework*, and *Planetary Health Framework*.  
- **Conflict Resolution:** BAZs use consensus-based processes, guided by TEK and facilitated by the *Meta-Governance Framework*, prioritizing "stacked functions" (e.g., agrovoltaics) and multi-use assessments for competing land uses (e.g., solar farms vs. agriculture). Failing BAZs trigger *Treaty*-backed interventions (e.g., temporary stewardship by neighboring BAZs).  
- **Safeguards Against Co-optation:** Independent certification systems with public audit disclosure and greenwashing surveillance mechanisms, enforced via the *Treaty*, prevent misuse of "regenerative" labels.  
- **Maritime and Freshwater Integration:** Specialized BAZ working groups address coastal soil erosion and freshwater governance in collaboration with adjacent BAZs.  
- **Global-Local Feedback Loops:** Regular feedback between BAZs and the *Global Soil Health Monitoring Service* ensures local practices align with global ecological and social equity goals, supported by a BAZ Solidarity Fund to redistribute resources to struggling BAZs.  
- **Adaptive Governance:** Periodic review of BAZ governance models incorporates new scientific/TEK insights, with the Soil Innovation Lab piloting emergent practices.
