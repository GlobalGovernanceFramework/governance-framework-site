# Soil Health & Land Use Governance Framework

**Tier:** 2 (Systems for Long-Term Thriving)
**Status:** Draft Outline

---

### Framework Position within the Golden Triangle

*This section will detail how the framework is empowered by the Treaty (e.g., enforcing a ban on soil-degrading chemicals), guided by the Indigenous Framework (e.g., TEK as the basis for regenerative agriculture), and coordinated by the Meta-Governance Framework.*

### Vision: Land as Relation, Not Commodity

*To reframe humanity's relationship with land and soil, shifting from an extractive, property-based model to a regenerative, stewardship-based model where soil is treated as a living, sacred commons essential for all life.*

### Core Principles

* **Soil as a Living Commons:** Establishes soil not as private property to be depleted, but as a shared, living entity with a right to be healthy.
* **Bioregional Governance:** Land use decisions are made at the watershed and ecosystem level through BAZs, superseding arbitrary political boundaries.
* **Land Rematriation & Restorative Justice:** Prioritizes returning land to Indigenous stewardship and creating mechanisms for healing historical land-based injustices.
* **Regenerative by Default:** Mandates that all land use practices must actively improve soil health, water cycles, and biodiversity.
* **Food & Water Sovereignty:** Ensures that land use policies prioritize the rights of local communities to control their own food and water sources.

### Structural Components

* **Global Soil Health Monitoring Service:** A decentralized network using satellites, local sensors, and TEK to provide a real-time "state of the world's soils" dashboard. Operates as part of the `Global Data Commons Trust`.
* **Bioregional Land & Food Councils:** Governance bodies within each BAZ responsible for creating and enforcing local land use plans consistent with Accord principles.
* **Land Rematriation & Justice Tribunal:** A specialized body, operating under the `Treaty's` Pillar 3, to adjudicate historical land claims and oversee restorative justice processes.
* **Global Regenerative Agriculture Fund:** Funded by the `Treaty's` Pillar 4, providing resources for farmers and communities to transition to regenerative practices.

### Key Mechanisms

* **The Global Soil Health Accord:** The binding international agreement.
* **Regenerative Agriculture Mandates:** A global phase-out of soil-degrading chemical pesticides and fertilizers.
* **Land Value & Anti-Speculation Tax:** A tax on the unimproved value of land to discourage speculative hoarding and incentivize efficient, regenerative use.
* **Community Land Trusts & Food Commons:** Legal and financial support for communities to take land out of the speculative market and hold it in common for food production, ecosystem restoration, and housing.
