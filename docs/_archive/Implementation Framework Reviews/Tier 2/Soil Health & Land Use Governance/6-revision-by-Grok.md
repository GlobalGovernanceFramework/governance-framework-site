# Soil Health & Land Use Governance Framework

**Tier:** 2 (Systems for Long-Term Thriving)  
**Status:** Final Revised Draft Outline  

---

### Plain Language Summary

Healthy soil is not just dirt—it's a living, breathing system that feeds life. This framework helps the world shift from taking from the land to giving back—so all people, plants, and animals can thrive together.

---

### Framework Position within the Golden Triangle

The Soil Health & Land Use Governance Framework is empowered by the *Treaty* through enforceable mechanisms such as bans on soil-degrading chemicals and the establishment of the Land Rematriation Tribunal under Pillar 3. It is guided by the *Indigenous Framework*, embedding Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) as the foundation for regenerative agriculture and soil health practices. The *Meta-Governance Framework* coordinates alignment across Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), resolving conflicts and ensuring consistency with global sustainability goals, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), climate targets, and the *Biodiversity Framework* for above-ground and below-ground ecological feedback loops. The framework also integrates with the *Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) Framework* to monetize ecological contributions and the *Aurora Accord* to ensure data sovereignty for soil-related knowledge.

### Vision: Land as Relation, Not Commodity

To reframe humanity's relationship with land and soil, shifting from an extractive, property-based model to a regenerative, stewardship-based model where soil is treated as a living, sacred commons essential for all life.

---

### Core Principles

- **Soil as a Living Commons:** Soil is not private property to be depleted but a shared, living entity with a right to be healthy, aligned with emerging "Rights of Nature" legal frameworks (e.g., Ecuador, New Zealand).  
- **Bioregional Governance:** Land use decisions are made at the watershed and ecosystem level through BAZs, superseding arbitrary political boundaries.  
- **Land Rematriation & Restorative Justice:** Prioritizes returning land to Indigenous stewardship and creating mechanisms for cultural healing and reparations for historical land-based injustices, including addressing colonial land grabs, extractive export agriculture, and international debt traps in Global South regions through debt-for-regeneration swaps and sovereignty-respecting aid programs.  
- **Regenerative by Default:** Mandates that all land use practices actively improve soil health, water cycles, and biodiversity, including predator-prey and microbial food web relationships.  
- **Food & Water Sovereignty:** Ensures local communities control their food and water sources, integrating urban-rural linkages (e.g., urban agriculture, rooftop gardens).  
- **Intergenerational Equity:** Ensures the voices of youth and future generations are included in land use governance through youth delegations in Bioregional Land Councils.  
- **Post-Ownership Stewardship:** Land stewardship may evolve beyond legal ownership models toward shared responsibility systems rooted in ecological and relational ethics.  
- **Soil-Human Health Reciprocity:** Recognizes the direct link between healthy soils, nutrient-dense food, and human health, fostering practices that enhance this reciprocal relationship.

### Structural Components

- **Global Soil Health Monitoring Service:** A decentralized network using satellites, local sensors, and TEK to provide a real-time "state of the world's soils" dashboard. Operates within the *Global Data Commons Trust*, tracking specific metrics like carbon sequestration rates, soil organic matter, microbial diversity, mycorrhizal density, fungal health, and social equity indicators (e.g., land rematriation progress, food sovereignty levels).  
- **Bioregional Land & Food Councils:** Governance bodies within each BAZ responsible for creating and enforcing local land use plans consistent with Accord principles. These councils include Indigenous-led review processes to integrate TEK, youth delegations for intergenerational input, and citizen-led participatory land futures modeling (e.g., open scenario tools, citizen juries). Councils also validate regenerative activities for *AUBI* Layer 2 Contributions, enabling participants to earn *Hearts* currency.  
- **Land Rematriation & Justice Tribunal:** A specialized body under the *Treaty’s* Pillar 3 to adjudicate historical land claims, oversee restorative justice processes, and facilitate cultural healing ceremonies, with specific provisions for Global South contexts addressing colonial legacies and debt-related dispossession.  
- **Global Regenerative Agriculture Fund:** Funded by the *Treaty’s* Pillar 4, providing resources for farmers transitioning to regenerative practices, including subsidies, education campaigns, and international farmer cooperation programs to counter resistance from industrial agriculture. The Fund also issues green bonds to attract private investment for soil restoration.  
- **Knowledge Commons Platform:** A global platform for sharing TEK-based regenerative practices, co-managed by Indigenous councils and scientists to ensure accessibility and cultural sensitivity across BAZs. Operates under the *Aurora Accord* to ensure Indigenous Data Sovereignty, community consent protocols, and data fiduciary standards. Soil memory is not only biological—it is cultural. Through story, ceremony, and science, we remember how to care for land. The Knowledge Commons honors both ancestral traditions and emergent ecological science, weaving them into an intergenerational tapestry of practices that evolve with the land itself.  
- **Crisis Response Mechanism:** A rapid-response team to address soil degradation hotspots (e.g., desertification, post-industrial land) with tailored restoration strategies, including transboundary coordination across BAZs for shared challenges like desertification corridors or migratory dust storm patterns.

### Key Mechanisms

- **The Global Soil Health Accord:** A binding international agreement enforcing regenerative practices and phasing out soil-degrading chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Violations are addressed through fines, trade sanctions, or restorative justice processes, enforced via the *Treaty’s* mechanisms.  
- **Regenerative Agriculture Mandates:** A phased global transition to regenerative practices, supported by subsidies, education, and international farmer networks to ease transitions from industrial methods. Independent certification systems, co-developed with Indigenous councils, prevent corporate co-optation and greenwashing of "regenerative" labels, with surveillance mechanisms to monitor compliance.  
- **Land Value & Anti-Speculation Tax:** A tax on the unimproved value of land, enforced globally via the *Treaty’s* trade leverage and standardized protocols to prevent evasion, discouraging speculative hoarding and incentivizing regenerative use.  
- **Community Land Trusts & Food Commons:** Legal and financial support for communities to hold land in common for food production, ecosystem restoration, housing, rewilded zones, sacred sites, and cultural landscapes as living libraries of soil restoration and biocultural memory.  
- **Soil Health Education Mandate:** Integrates soil literacy into global school curricula, overseen by the *Indigenous Framework*, to foster widespread understanding of soil as a living commons.  
- **Urban Soil Health Integration:** Policies to promote urban agriculture (e.g., rooftop gardens, urban soil restoration) to ensure the framework’s applicability in urban contexts.  
- **Nutrient Density & Food Quality Verification:** In partnership with the *Planetary Health Framework*, tracks the nutrient density of food produced from soils with high health scores. Food from verified regenerative BAZs receives a "Planetary Health Certified" label, enhancing market and public health benefits.  
- **The Right to Ecological Repair:** Guarantees communities access to resources and knowledge needed to restore degraded land, including open-source TEK via the *Knowledge Commons*, native seed banks, and protection from corporate patents on remediation technologies, aligning with the *Right to Repair Mandate* from the *Global Data Governance & Sovereignty Framework*.
