# Soil Health & Land Use Governance Framework

**Tier:** 2 (Systems for Long-Term Thriving)  
**Status:** Revised Draft Outline  

---

### Framework Position within the Golden Triangle

The Soil Health & Land Use Governance Framework is empowered by the *Treaty* through enforceable mechanisms such as bans on soil-degrading chemicals and the establishment of the Land Rematriation Tribunal under Pillar 3. It is guided by the *Indigenous Framework*, embedding Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) as the foundation for regenerative agriculture and soil health practices. The *Meta-Governance Framework* coordinates alignment across Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), resolving conflicts and ensuring consistency with global sustainability goals, such as the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and climate targets.

### Vision: Land as Relation, Not Commodity

To reframe humanity's relationship with land and soil, shifting from an extractive, property-based model to a regenerative, stewardship-based model where soil is treated as a living, sacred commons essential for all life.

---

### Core Principles

- **Soil as a Living Commons:** Soil is not private property to be depleted but a shared, living entity with a right to be healthy, aligned with emerging "Rights of Nature" legal frameworks (e.g., Ecuador, New Zealand).  
- **Bioregional Governance:** Land use decisions are made at the watershed and ecosystem level through BAZs, superseding arbitrary political boundaries.  
- **Land Rematriation & Restorative Justice:** Prioritizes returning land to Indigenous stewardship and creating mechanisms for cultural healing and reparations for historical land-based injustices.  
- **Regenerative by Default:** Mandates that all land use practices actively improve soil health, water cycles, and biodiversity.  
- **Food & Water Sovereignty:** Ensures local communities control their food and water sources, integrating urban-rural linkages (e.g., urban agriculture, rooftop gardens).  
- **Intergenerational Equity:** Ensures the voices of youth and future generations are included in land use governance through youth delegations in Bioregional Land Councils.

### Structural Components

- **Global Soil Health Monitoring Service:** A decentralized network using satellites, local sensors, and TEK to provide a real-time "state of the world's soils" dashboard. Operates within the *Global Data Commons Trust*, tracking specific metrics like carbon sequestration rates, microbial diversity, and social equity indicators (e.g., land rematriation progress, food sovereignty levels).  
- **Bioregional Land & Food Councils:** Governance bodies within each BAZ responsible for creating and enforcing local land use plans consistent with Accord principles. These councils include Indigenous-led review processes to integrate TEK and youth delegations for intergenerational input.  
- **Land Rematriation & Justice Tribunal:** A specialized body under the *Treaty’s* Pillar 3 to adjudicate historical land claims, oversee restorative justice processes, and facilitate cultural healing ceremonies.  
- **Global Regenerative Agriculture Fund:** Funded by the *Treaty’s* Pillar 4, providing resources for farmers transitioning to regenerative practices, including subsidies and education campaigns to counter resistance from industrial agriculture. The Fund also explores green bonds to attract private investment for soil restoration.  
- **Knowledge Commons Platform:** A global platform for sharing TEK-based regenerative practices, co-managed by Indigenous councils and scientists to ensure accessibility and cultural sensitivity across BAZs.  
- **Crisis Response Mechanism:** A rapid-response team to address soil degradation hotspots (e.g., desertification, post-industrial land) with tailored restoration strategies.

### Key Mechanisms

- **The Global Soil Health Accord:** A binding international agreement enforcing regenerative practices and phasing out soil-degrading chemical pesticides and fertilizers. Violations are addressed through fines, trade sanctions, or restorative justice processes, enforced via the *Treaty’s* mechanisms.  
- **Regenerative Agriculture Mandates:** A phased global transition to regenerative practices, supported by subsidies and education to ease farmers’ shift from industrial methods. Certification systems prevent corporate co-optation of "regenerative" labels.  
- **Land Value & Anti-Speculation Tax:** A tax on the unimproved value of land, enforced globally via the *Treaty’s* trade leverage, to discourage speculative hoarding and incentivize regenerative use.  
- **Community Land Trusts & Food Commons:** Legal and financial support for communities to hold land in common for food production, ecosystem restoration, and housing, removing it from speculative markets.  
- **Soil Health Education Mandate:** Integrates soil literacy into global school curricula, overseen by the *Indigenous Framework*, to foster widespread understanding of soil as a living commons.  
- **Urban Soil Health Integration:** Policies to promote urban agriculture (e.g., rooftop gardens, urban soil restoration) to ensure the framework’s applicability in urban contexts.

### Implementation Pathways

- **Phased Rollout:**  
  - **Short-Term (1–5 years):** Pilot BAZs in diverse bioregions, testing governance and monitoring systems.  
  - **Medium-Term (5–15 years):** Regional adoption of BAZs, scaling successful pilots and refining enforcement mechanisms.  
  - **Long-Term (15+ years):** Global scaling of the framework, fully integrating with the *Treaty* and *Meta-Governance Framework*.  
- **Conflict Resolution:** BAZs resolve disputes (e.g., food production vs. rewilding) through participatory processes, guided by TEK and facilitated by the *Meta-Governance Framework*.  
- **Safeguards Against Co-optation:** Independent certification systems, co-developed with Indigenous councils, ensure authentic regenerative practices.  
- **Maritime and Freshwater Integration:** The framework addresses coastal soil erosion and freshwater governance through collaboration with adjacent BAZs and specialized working groups.  

---

### Metrics for Success

- **Soil Health Indicators:** Carbon sequestration rates, soil organic matter, microbial diversity, and water retention capacity, tracked via the Global Soil Health Monitoring Service.  
- **Social Equity Metrics:** Progress on land rematriation, reductions in land-based inequalities, and local food sovereignty levels.  
- **Ecosystem Metrics:** Increases in biodiversity, restoration of degraded land, and improvements in watershed health.  

---

### Key Questions Addressed

- **Dispute Resolution:** BAZs use consensus-based processes, guided by TEK and facilitated by the *Meta-Governance Framework*, to prioritize regenerative outcomes.  
- **Corporate Co-optation:** Certification systems and strict enforcement via the *Treaty* prevent misuse of "regenerative" labels.  
- **Maritime/Freshwater Linkages:** Specialized BAZ working groups address coastal and freshwater challenges, ensuring holistic governance.
