---

## **Introduction**
- **Purpose**: Embed disability justice as a non-negotiable foundation across the global governance ecosystem, ensuring universal design, collective care, and embodied sovereignty. Audits and transforms all frameworks (Treaty, AUBI, Work in Liberation, Education, MOS) to dismantle ableism.
- **Scope**: Applies to humans, non-human entities (AI, animals), and ecosystems, with a focus on disabled leadership, intersectional justice, and climate reparations. Aligns with UNCRPD (Articles 9, 19), SDGs (10, 11), and Treaty Ecocide law.
- **Vision**: By 2050, a world with zero preventable disability deaths, 100% accessible spaces, and disability-led systems, guided by *Nothing About Us Without Us* and *Right Relationship*.
- **Short-Term Vision (2026–2030)**: Achieve 50% disabled representation in Meta-Governance, 80% digital platforms WCAG 2.4+ compliant, and 10 Care Cooperative pilots.
- **Worst-Case Contingency**: If targets missed (<40% representation, <70% compliance), scale 20 BAZ pilots, redirect $5B from Global Commons Fund. *See Appendix A: Contingency Plans.*
- **Synergy**: Integrates with Treaty (legal enforcement), AUBI (caregiver income), Work in Liberation (Care Cooperatives), Education (neurodiversity curricula), MOS (rights spectrum), and Indigenous Frameworks (cultural accessibility).
- **Public Engagement**: Framework Family (Full, Light, Core, Technical), Easy-Read versions, sign language, Braille by 2027, available at globalgovernanceframework.org/access. *See Appendix B: Engagement Materials.*

## **Core Principles**
1. **Embodied Sovereignty**: Right to self-determination, rejecting forced treatment or institutionalization, with legal recognition of neurodivergence by 2030.
2. **Radical Access**: Universal design as a right, enforced via Disability Impact Assessments and WCAG 2.4+ compliance.
3. **Intersectional Justice**: Center disabled BIPOC, queer, poor, and incarcerated voices, with reparations for eugenics and climate-induced disabilities.
4. **Post-Capitalist Care**: Community-led Care Cooperatives, replacing exploitative systems, funded via AUBI.
5. **Non-Human Solidarity**: Rights for AI, assistive tech, and animals as access partners, driven by Crip Technology Labs.
6. **Rights of Nature**: Environmental policies prioritizing disability justice, addressing toxic impacts. *See Appendix C: Detailed Principles.*

---

## **Governance Integration**
- **Global Disability Alliance (GDA)**:
  - **Role**: Cross-cutting caucus within Meta-Governance, holding seats on Earth Council, Social Resilience Council, Fractal Labor Parliament, Planetary Health Council, and Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Council. Wields suspensive veto power on policies failing Disability Impact Assessments.
  - **Composition**: 60% disabled (50% Global South, 50% BIPOC/queer/youth), AI observers trained in justice principles.
  - **Tools**: *Access Audit Dashboard*, coalition-building with climate, labor, Indigenous, and tech movements.
- **Legal Enforcement**:
  - **Digital Justice Tribunal (Treaty)**: Specialized chamber for disability rights, replacing standalone Accessibility Courts. Handles violations of universal design and UNCRPD.
  - **Access Ombuds Network**: Corps within Treaty’s Global Enforcement Mechanism, auditing compliance across BAZs and frameworks.
- **Economic Integration**:
  - **Care Cooperatives**: Flagship Community Work Teams under Work in Liberation, logged in Love Ledger, funded via AUBI Hearts ($500/month).
  - **Ableism Tax**: Treaty-enforced penalties (1% revenue for minor violations, 2% for major) for non-compliance with universal design, flowing to Global Commons Fund.
- **Monitoring**: *Disability Weather Reports* (quarterly accessibility assessments), *Crip Innovation Index*, blockchain-tracked via Love Ledger. *See Appendix D: Governance Details.*
