## Specific Textual Enhancements

### **Enhanced Preamble**:
"Our current global trade system was designed to maximize the flow of capital and goods, often at the expense of ecosystems and communities, while perpetuating colonial extractive relationships that concentrate wealth and power. A regenerative civilization requires decolonizing exchange—dismantling systems that enable resource extraction from the Global South to serve Global North consumption, and building trade relationships based on reciprocity, sovereignty, and ecological regeneration."

### **Additional Core Principle**:
**"Decolonized Exchange"**: Trade relationships must redress colonial extractive patterns, ensuring that resource-rich communities benefit from their resources rather than serving as sacrifice zones for global consumption.

### **Enhanced Implementation Timeline**:
**Phase 1 Detail**: "First RTZ pilot between 3-5 bioregions selected based on: (1) existing sustainability commitments, (2) complementary resource profiles enabling closed-loop trade, (3) strong civil society capacity for democratic oversight, (4) government willingness to challenge existing trade agreements."
