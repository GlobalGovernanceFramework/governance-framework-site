# **Enhanced Global Governance Framework for Migration & Human Mobility**  
*A Comprehensive Application Layer for Planetary Coordination*  

---

## **1. Introduction: Migration as Planetary Coordination in Action**

**Vision**:  
> *"Migration is not a crisis to manage but a natural force to harmonize—a planetary circulatory system of people, cultures, and knowledge that regenerates ecosystems, economies, and societies when governed through Indigenous wisdom and meta-governance coordination."*  

This framework operationalizes the principles of the **[Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home)** and the **[Integrated Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance)** to address the planetary phenomenon of human mobility. It is guided by the bioregional governance and Traditional Ecological Knowledge of the **[Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge)** and powered by the sacred economics and *Hearts* currency systems of the **[Financial Systems Framework](/frameworks/financial-systems)**.

Rather than treating migration as a separate policy domain, this framework demonstrates how meta-governance principles create coordinated responses that honor Indigenous sovereignty while addressing the climate displacement, economic inequality, and governance failures that drive forced migration.

**Core Principles**:  
- **Fluid Sovereignty**: Rights and belonging tied to community participation, not static borders, implementing the meta-governance principle of **polycentric coordination**
- **Ecological Alignment**: Migration policies restore ecosystems and climate stability, operationalizing the **planetary stewardship** principle through bioregional governance
- **Indigenous-Led Stewardship**: Traditional Knowledge guides all migration governance, with Indigenous communities holding veto authority over policies affecting their territories through **FPIC 2.0 protocols** from the Indigenous Framework
- **Sacred Economics Integration**: Migration contributions valued through the *Hearts* currency system, creating economic incentives for care work and ecological restoration rather than exploitation
- **Meta-Governance Coordination**: Crisis response, cultural integration, and youth leadership operate through the coordination mechanisms detailed in the Meta-Governance Framework
- **Anti-Fragility**: Systems adapt to climate shocks through the adaptive governance principles embedded in all frameworks
- **Seventh-Generation Accountability**: Migration policies evaluated for their impact on seven generations, following Indigenous governance protocols

**Framework Integration Architecture**:
- **Legal Foundation**: Migration Justice Tribunals established under **Pillar 3** of the Treaty's expansion of universal jurisdiction and ecocide law
- **Economic Infrastructure**: Funded through the Treaty's **Pillar 4** mechanisms including carbon tax and Payment for Global Public Goods Fund, with value exchanges through the *Hearts* currency system
- **Coordination System**: Operates as a specialized application within the Meta-Governance Framework's **crisis response** and **cultural integration** tracks
- **Cultural Grounding**: All implementation guided by **Bioregional Autonomous Zones** and **Traditional Knowledge protection systems** from the Indigenous Framework
- **Democratic Authority**: Planetary Migration Council operates as a **Meta-Governance Coordination Council** with 50% migrant representation and Indigenous sovereignty recognition

## **6. Radical FAQs Through Framework Integration**

**Q: How does this avoid creating a new form of global governance domination?**  
> *"This framework operates through **polycentric coordination** and **Indigenous sovereignty**, ensuring no single authority controls migration governance. **Bioregional Autonomous Zones** maintain territorial jurisdiction while **Meta-Governance protocols** enable voluntary cooperation without subordination."*

**Q: What prevents wealthy nations from capturing this system?**  
> *"**Indigenous communities exercise veto authority** over policies affecting their territories, **youth councils have binding power** over long-term decisions, and the **Office of the Adversary** monitors for elite capture. **Sacred economics** prevents monetary manipulation while **traditional authority** cannot be bought or controlled."*

**Q: How does this address climate displacement at the needed scale?**  
> *"**Climate Resilience Visas** operate through **Treaty emergency protocols** with **24-hour coordination capability**, funded through **carbon tax revenue** rather than voluntary aid. **Bioregional governance** enables ecosystem-scale response while **Indigenous early warning systems** enable prevention rather than just reaction."*

**Q: What about communities that reject these frameworks?**  
> *"All participation is voluntary and **culturally appropriate**. **Indigenous communities retain exit authority** through **Red Lines Clause**, and **Meta-Governance subsidiarity** means local decisions stay local. The frameworks coordinate willing participants rather than imposing universal requirements."*
