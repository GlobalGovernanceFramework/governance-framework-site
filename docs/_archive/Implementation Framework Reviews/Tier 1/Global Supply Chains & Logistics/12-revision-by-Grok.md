## FSF Description Box
The **Financial Systems Framework (FSF)** is a proposed global governance mechanism to orchestrate equitable resource flows, integrating traditional finance (fiat, taxes) with innovative currencies like *Hearts* and *Leaves*. Governed by a decentralized Global Commons Council with 50% Global South representation, it aligns with the Paris Agreement and UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human Rights. It supports GSCL through Resource & Environmental Taxes, microloans, and ethical data protocols, ensuring resilient funding and transparency.

## 2. Core Pillars

### 2.1 Diversified and Localized Production
> **Vignette**: In Kenya, a solar-powered SME hub earns 200 *Hearts* for recycling plastic into 3D-printing filament, reducing emissions and creating 50 local jobs.

- **Goal**: Shift to bioregional, nearshored, and localized production to cut emissions by 30% and enhance resilience.
- **Strategies**:
  - **Subsidize IoT kits** and training for 10,000 SMEs by 2030, with 50% in Global South.
  - **Reward suppliers** with *Hearts* for ESG practices (e.g., 1 ton CO2 reduction = 100 *Hearts*).
  - **Distribute *Leaves*** for micro-rewards (e.g., 10 *Leaves* for local waste cleanup), convertible to tax credits (100 *Leaves* = $10 credit).
  - **Fund regional hubs** via FSF’s Resource & Environmental Taxes and Financial Transaction Taxes.
  - **Offer microloans** for Global South SMEs to overcome IoT/AI adoption costs.
  - **Low-tech pathway**: Provide analog production logs for SMEs in low-connectivity areas.
- **Metrics** | **Target**:
