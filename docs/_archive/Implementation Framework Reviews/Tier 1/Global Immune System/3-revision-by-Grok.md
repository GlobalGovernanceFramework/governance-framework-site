# Global Health & Pandemic Security (GH&PS) Framework Outline

## Preamble & Core Principles

**Vision:** To establish a global immune system that prevents, detects, and defeats pandemics with speed, equity, and resilience, serving as the operational arm under the strategic guidance of the Planetary Health Council.

**Core Principles:**
- **Speed & Solidarity Over Sovereignty (in Crisis):** Rapid, coordinated global action supersedes national interests during Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC).
- **Open Science & Public-First IP:** All health innovations funded by public resources are held in the global commons, free from monopolistic barriers.
- **Radical Equity:** Prioritize marginalized and vulnerable populations in resource allocation and system design.
- **Proactive Prevention:** Emphasize upstream zoonotic and environmental risk mitigation over reactive measures.
- **Subsidiarity:** Empower local and regional systems as the foundation of global health security.
- **Scientific Integrity with Epistemic Humility:** Protect scientific rigor while integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and community insights.
