# Global Data Governance & Sovereignty Framework

**Tier:** 1 (Urgent Global Stability & Justice)
**Status:** Draft Outline

---

## 1. Introduction: Stewarding the World's Collective Intelligence

**Vision:** To reframe data from a privately extracted commodity into a sacred trust—a reflection of our individual lives, community wisdom, and planetary health. This framework establishes a global order for data that protects digital dignity, enables innovation for public good, and ensures the benefits of the digital age are shared by all, not concentrated in the hands of a few.

**Core Problem:** Humanity is navigating the 21st century with 20th-century rules for its most valuable new resource. The current state is a digital wild west defined by data colonialism, surveillance capitalism, and geopolitical fragmentation. This chaos erodes trust, undermines democracy, creates profound inequities, and leaves our collective digital infrastructure vulnerable to collapse and manipulation.

**Framework's Role:** This framework provides the foundational "rules of the road" for the digital age. It is the essential prerequisite for governing AI, building the **`Digital Commons`**, and ensuring that other critical frameworks (`Planetary Health`, `Financial Systems`, `AUBI`) can function securely and ethically. It is enabled by the legal authority of the **`Treaty for Our Only Home`**, coordinated via the **`Meta-Governance Framework`**, and ethically grounded in the non-negotiable principle of **`Indigenous Data Sovereignty`**.

## 2. Core Principles

* **Data as a Three-Fold Commons:** Data is not monolithic. This framework recognizes three distinct categories with different rights and responsibilities:
    1.  **Personal Data:** Generated by an individual. Belongs to the individual under the principle of self-sovereignty.
    2.  **Community & Cultural Data:** Generated by or representing a collective (e.g., a community's health data, a linguistic group's language data, Indigenous Traditional Knowledge). Belongs to the collective under the principle of community sovereignty.
    3.  **Public & Environmental Data:** Data that is a global public good (e.g., climate sensor data, public genomic sequences, satellite imagery). To be stewarded for the benefit of all humanity and the planet.

* **Digital Dignity & Sovereignty:** Every individual and community has an inalienable right to control their own digital identity and data. This explicitly codifies **Indigenous Data Sovereignty** (as defined by the Indigenous Governance Framework) as a cornerstone of the entire global data architecture.

* **Fiduciary Responsibility:** Any entity holding another's personal or community data has a legally binding fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the data subjects, not their own commercial or political interests.

* **Interoperability by Consent:** Data systems must be able to communicate to unlock innovation, but this flow is governed by principles of trust, security, and explicit, ongoing consent—not by default open access.

* **Epistemic Justice:** The governance of data must actively work to dismantle knowledge hierarchies. It must protect and value diverse ways of knowing, ensuring that Indigenous, traditional, and community knowledge is not devalued or exploited by dominant data paradigms.

* **Accountability & Redress:** Data-related harms (from privacy breaches to algorithmic bias) must have clear, accessible, and enforceable pathways to justice and restitution.

## 3. Structural Components: The Digital Sovereignty Charter

This framework is enacted through a new binding international agreement, the **Digital Sovereignty Charter**, established under the authority of the `Treaty for Our Only Home`.

### 3.1. The Global Digital Governance Council (GDGC)

* **Function:** The primary meta-governance body for the digital world. It sets global technical and ethical standards, mediates cross-border data conflicts, and provides oversight for the digital ecosystem. It is coordinated via the **`Meta-Governance Framework`**.
* **Composition:** A multi-stakeholder body with balanced representation from governments, civil society, technical experts, and the private sector. It includes a permanent, empowered **Indigenous Data Sovereignty Council**.
* **Key Powers:**
    * Chartering and auditing **Data Fiduciaries**.
    * Setting standards for interoperability and data portability.
    * Coordinating global responses to major cybersecurity threats and digital harms.

### 3.2. The Indigenous Data Sovereignty Council

* **Function:** As defined in the **`Indigenous Governance Framework`**, this council is the supreme authority on the governance of all Indigenous data and Traditional Knowledge in digital forms.
* **Authority:** Holds **absolute veto power** within the GDGC on any standard, policy, or protocol that affects Indigenous data. It is not an advisory body; it is a sovereign authority operating in partnership.

### 3.3. The Global Data Commons Trust

* **Function:** A decentralized entity responsible for stewarding **Public & Environmental Data**. It ensures that critical global datasets (climate models, public health data, etc.) are accurately maintained, securely stored, and made accessible for research and public good under clear ethical guidelines.
* **Governance:** Governed by a board of scientific, ethical, and community leaders, operating with full transparency.

### 3.4. The Digital Justice Tribunal

* **Function:** A specialized court established under the `Treaty's` Pillar 3 (Strengthening Global Law & Enforcement).
* **Jurisdiction:** Has compulsory jurisdiction over:
    * Crimes against digital dignity (e.g., mass surveillance by a state or corporation).
    * Systemic data rights violations by major technology platforms.
    * Disputes over data sovereignty between nations or communities.
    * Theft or misuse of data from the Global Data Commons Trust.

## 4. Key Mechanisms & Policies

### 4.1. The Data Fiduciary Standard & Certification

* **Policy:** A global legal standard is established, shifting the burden of data protection from individuals ("I consent") to data holders. Any organization wishing to manage significant amounts of personal or community data must be certified as a **Data Fiduciary** by the GDGC.
* **Requirements:** To be certified, a fiduciary must demonstrate technical security, ethical AI governance, transparent algorithms, and a business model that is not based on exploiting user data against their interests.

### 4.2. The Data Portability & "Right to Exit" Mandate

* **Policy:** All major digital platforms are required to use open standards and provide APIs that allow users and communities to move their data (including social graphs, content, and transaction histories) to a competitor or a personal data store with one click.
* **Impact:** This breaks the monopolistic "network effects" of dominant platforms and fosters a more competitive, innovative digital ecosystem.

### 4.3. The Global Data Taxation Framework

* **Policy:** A tax is levied on the revenue generated from the commercial use of large-scale personal and community data. This is a tax on the *extraction* of this valuable resource.
* **Funding Allocation:** Revenue flows directly into the `Treaty's` **Payment for Global Public Goods Fund** (Pillar 4) with a significant portion earmarked for:
    1.  Funding the **Global Data Commons Trust**.
    2.  Investing in digital literacy and infrastructure in the Global South.
    3.  Providing resources directly to communities to build their own sovereign data infrastructure.

### 4.4. The AI Training Data Transparency Mandate

* **Policy:** Any entity developing or deploying a large-scale AI model must maintain a public, auditable registry of the datasets used for its training.
* **Enforcement:** The Digital Justice Tribunal can levy massive fines and mandate model shutdowns if it is found that the model was trained on illegally sourced data, stolen IP, or non-consensual personal/community data. This directly addresses one of the biggest ethical crises in modern AI.

## 5. Implementation Pathways

* **Phase 1 (Years 1-3): Charter & Governance Formation**
    * Ratify the Digital Sovereignty Charter through the reformed UNGA.
    * Establish the Global Digital Governance Council (GDGC) and the Indigenous Data Sovereignty Council.
    * Launch pilot programs for Data Fiduciary certification in 3-5 "Digital Sanctuary" nations (e.g., Estonia, Costa Rica).

* **Phase 2 (Years 4-7): Infrastructure & Enforcement**
    * Build the technical and legal infrastructure for the Global Data Commons Trust.
    * Operationalize the Digital Justice Tribunal and hear its first landmark cases.
    * Mandate the "Right to Exit" protocols for all major tech platforms operating within Treaty-signatory nations.

* **Phase 3 (Years 8+): Global Integration & Maturation**
    * The Data Taxation Framework becomes a primary source of funding for global digital public goods.
    * The Data Fiduciary standard becomes the global norm, shifting the entire digital economy towards a trust-based model.
    * Indigenous communities have established robust, sovereign data infrastructures, protecting their knowledge for future generations.

## 6. Synergies with Core Frameworks

* **`Treaty`:** Provides the legal authority (Pillar 1 & 3) and funding mechanisms (Pillar 4) to make this entire governance regime binding and sustainable.
* **`Meta-Governance`:** Provides the coordination architecture for the GDGC to interface with national regulators, corporations, and other global councils, preventing digital governance from becoming another silo.
* **`Indigenous Governance`:** This is the most critical synergy. The Data Governance Framework is the primary vehicle for implementing **Indigenous Data Sovereignty** on a global scale, ensuring the digital world does not repeat the extractive patterns of the colonial era.
* **`Planetary Health`:** Provides the rules for the `Global Pathogen Surveillance Network`, ensuring data is shared for public good without violating sovereignty.
* **`Financial Systems` & `AUBI`:** Provides the secure, private, and ethical data layer required for the `Love Ledger` and `Hearts` currency to function as tools of empowerment, not surveillance.
