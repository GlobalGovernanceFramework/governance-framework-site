# Global Data Governance & Sovereignty Framework

**Tier:** 1 (Urgent Global Stability & Justice)  
**Status:** Revised Draft Outline  

---

## 1. Introduction: Stewarding the World's Collective Intelligence

**Vision:** To reframe data from a privately extracted commodity into a sacred trust—a reflection of our individual lives, community wisdom, and planetary health. This framework establishes a global order for data that protects digital dignity, enables innovation for public good, and ensures the benefits of the digital age are shared by all, not concentrated in the hands of a few.  
**Elevator Pitch:** This framework transforms data into a sacred trust, empowering individuals and communities, ensuring Indigenous sovereignty, and fostering ethical innovation for a just digital age.  

**Core Problem:** Humanity is navigating the 21st century with 20th-century rules for its most valuable resource. The current state is a digital wild west defined by data colonialism, surveillance capitalism, and geopolitical fragmentation. Existing frameworks like GDPR fail to address AI training data loopholes (e.g., non-consensual data scraping), lack robust cross-border enforcement, and ignore the ecological impact of data infrastructure (e.g., data centers consuming 1-2% of global electricity). Data breaches cost an estimated $4.45 billion annually (2023 IBM report), eroding trust, undermining democracy, creating inequities, and leaving digital infrastructure vulnerable to collapse and manipulation. **Case Study:** In 2021, a major social media platform’s data breach exposed 533 million users’ personal data, highlighting the failure of consent-based models to prevent mass exploitation.  

**Framework's Role:** This framework provides the foundational "rules of the road" for the digital age, prioritizing ecological sustainability and justice. It is the prerequisite for governing AI, building the **Digital Commons**, and enabling frameworks like **Planetary Health**, **Financial Systems**, **AUBI**, and **Peace & Conflict** to function securely and ethically. It is enabled by the **Treaty for Our Only Home**, coordinated via the **Meta-Governance Framework**, and grounded in **Indigenous Data Sovereignty**.

## 2. Core Principles

* **Data as a Three-Fold Commons:** Data is not monolithic. This framework recognizes three distinct categories with different rights and responsibilities:  
  1. **Personal Data:** Generated by an individual (e.g., location data, biometric info, private messages). Belongs to the individual under self-sovereignty.  
  2. **Community & Cultural Data:** Generated by or representing a collective (e.g., water usage data from a village, ancestral oral histories, Indigenous Traditional Knowledge). Belongs to the collective under community sovereignty.  
  3. **Public & Environmental Data:** Data that is a global public good (e.g., NASA climate models, earthquake sensor networks, public genomic sequences). To be stewarded for the benefit of all humanity and the planet.  

* **Digital Dignity & Sovereignty:** Every individual and community has an inalienable right to control their digital identity and data, including anonymity, algorithmic transparency, and protection from non-consensual use. **Indigenous Data Sovereignty** is a cornerstone of the global data architecture.  

* **Fiduciary Responsibility:** Entities holding personal or community data have a legally binding duty to prioritize data subjects’ interests over commercial or political gains.  

* **Interoperability by Consent:** Data systems must enable innovation through secure, consent-driven interoperability, not default open access.  

* **Epistemic Justice:** Governance must dismantle knowledge hierarchies, valuing Indigenous, traditional, and community knowledge equitably.  

* **Accountability & Redress:** Data-related harms (e.g., privacy breaches, algorithmic bias) must have clear, enforceable pathways to justice and restitution.  

* **Ecological Sustainability:** Data infrastructure must minimize environmental impact (e.g., energy consumption, e-waste) and promote regenerative digital infrastructure (e.g., renewable-powered data centers, circular hardware lifecycles) to align with planetary health.  

* **Temporal Data Rights:** Data retention periods must be defined based on data type (e.g., personal data deleted after consent expires, public data retained for scientific value), balancing utility and privacy.
