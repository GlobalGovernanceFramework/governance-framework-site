# Global Data Governance & Sovereignty Framework

**Tier:** 1 (Urgent Global Stability & Justice)  
**Status:** Revised Draft Outline  

---

## 1. Introduction: Stewarding the World's Collective Intelligence

**Vision:** To reframe data from a privately extracted commodity into a sacred trust—a reflection of our individual lives, community wisdom, and planetary health. This framework establishes a global order for data that protects digital dignity, enables innovation for public good, and ensures the benefits of the digital age are shared by all, not concentrated in the hands of a few.  
**Elevator Pitch:** This framework transforms data into a sacred trust, empowering individuals and communities, ensuring Indigenous sovereignty, and fostering ethical innovation for a just digital age.  

**Core Problem:** Humanity is navigating the 21st century with 20th-century rules for its most valuable new resource. The current state is a digital wild west defined by data colonialism, surveillance capitalism, and geopolitical fragmentation. Existing frameworks like GDPR fail to address AI training data loopholes (e.g., non-consensual data scraping), lack robust cross-border enforcement, and ignore the ecological impact of data infrastructure (e.g., energy-intensive data centers). This chaos erodes trust, undermines democracy, creates profound inequities, and leaves our collective digital infrastructure vulnerable to collapse and manipulation.  

**Framework's Role:** This framework provides the foundational "rules of the road" for the digital age. It is the essential prerequisite for governing AI, building the **Digital Commons**, and ensuring that other critical frameworks (**Planetary Health**, **Financial Systems**, **AUBI**) can function securely and ethically. It is enabled by the legal authority of the **Treaty for Our Only Home**, coordinated via the **Meta-Governance Framework**, and ethically grounded in the non-negotiable principle of **Indigenous Data Sovereignty**.

## 2. Core Principles

* **Data as a Three-Fold Commons:** Data is not monolithic. This framework recognizes three distinct categories with different rights and responsibilities:  
  1. **Personal Data:** Generated by an individual. Belongs to the individual under the principle of self-sovereignty.  
  2. **Community & Cultural Data:** Generated by or representing a collective (e.g., a community's health data, a linguistic group's language data, Indigenous Traditional Knowledge). Belongs to the collective under the principle of community sovereignty.  
  3. **Public & Environmental Data:** Data that is a global public good (e.g., climate sensor data, public genomic sequences, satellite imagery). To be stewarded for the benefit of all humanity and the planet.  

* **Digital Dignity & Sovereignty:** Every individual and community has an inalienable right to control their own digital identity and data, including rights to anonymity, algorithmic transparency, and protection from non-consensual data use. This explicitly codifies **Indigenous Data Sovereignty** (as defined by the Indigenous Governance Framework) as a cornerstone of the entire global data architecture.  

* **Fiduciary Responsibility:** Any entity holding another's personal or community data has a legally binding fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the data subjects, not their own commercial or political interests.  

* **Interoperability by Consent:** Data systems must be able to communicate to unlock innovation, but this flow is governed by principles of trust, security, and explicit, ongoing consent—not by default open access.  

* **Epistemic Justice:** The governance of data must actively work to dismantle knowledge hierarchies. It must protect and value diverse ways of knowing, ensuring that Indigenous, traditional, and community knowledge is not devalued or exploited by dominant data paradigms.  

* **Accountability & Redress:** Data-related harms (from privacy breaches to algorithmic bias) must have clear, accessible, and enforceable pathways to justice and restitution.  

* **Ecological Sustainability:** Data infrastructure must minimize environmental impact, addressing energy consumption and e-waste to align with planetary health goals.

## 3. Structural Components: The Digital Sovereignty Charter

This framework is enacted through a new binding international agreement, the **Digital Sovereignty Charter**, established under the authority of the **Treaty for Our Only Home**.  

### 3.1. The Global Digital Governance Council (GDGC)  

* **Function:** The primary meta-governance body for the digital world. It sets global technical and ethical standards, mediates cross-border data conflicts, and provides oversight for the digital ecosystem. It coordinates with the **Meta-Governance Framework** via crisis coordination protocols (e.g., joint responses to cybersecurity threats).  
* **Composition:** A multi-stakeholder body with balanced representation from governments, civil society, technical experts, and the private sector. It includes a permanent, empowered **Indigenous Data Sovereignty Council** and a **Youth Advisory Council** to ensure intergenerational justice.  
* **Key Powers:**  
  - Chartering and auditing **Data Fiduciaries**.  
  - Setting standards for interoperability and data portability.  
  - Coordinating global responses to major cybersecurity threats and digital harms.  
  - Subject to annual audits by the **Indigenous Data Sovereignty Council** to ensure accountability.  

### 3.2. The Indigenous Data Sovereignty Council  

* **Function:** As defined in the **Indigenous Governance Framework**, this council is the supreme authority on the governance of all Indigenous data and Traditional Knowledge in digital forms.  
* **Authority:** Holds **absolute veto power** within the GDGC on any standard, policy, or protocol that affects Indigenous data. It is a sovereign authority operating in partnership, not an advisory body. Conducts annual audits of GDGC decisions to ensure compliance with Indigenous rights.  

### 3.3. The Global Data Commons Trust  

* **Function:** A decentralized entity responsible for stewarding **Public & Environmental Data**. It ensures that critical global datasets (climate models, public health data, etc.) are accurately maintained, securely stored, and made accessible for research and public good under clear ethical guidelines. Uses technologies like blockchain or DAOs to prevent bureaucratic capture.  
* **Governance:** Governed by a transparent board of scientific, ethical, and community leaders, ensuring planetary health data is shared without exploitation (e.g., via anonymized, consent-based protocols).  

### 3.4. The Digital Justice Tribunal  

* **Function:** A specialized court established under the **Treaty’s** Pillar 3 (Strengthening Global Law & Enforcement).  
* **Jurisdiction:** Has compulsory jurisdiction over:  
  - Crimes against digital dignity (e.g., mass surveillance by a state or corporation).  
  - Systemic data rights violations by major technology platforms.  
  - Disputes over data sovereignty between nations or communities.  
  - Theft or misuse of data from the Global Data Commons Trust.

## 4. Key Mechanisms & Policies

### 4.1. The Data Fiduciary Standard & Certification  

* **Policy:** A global legal standard shifts the burden of data protection from individuals ("I consent") to certified **Data Fiduciaries**. Any organization managing significant personal or community data must demonstrate technical security, ethical AI governance, transparent algorithms, and a non-exploitative business model.  
* **Requirements:** Certification by the GDGC, with annual Indigenous-led audits to ensure compliance.  

### 4.2. The Data Portability & "Right to Exit" Mandate  

* **Policy:** All major digital platforms are required to use open standards and provide APIs that allow users and communities to move their data (including social graphs, content, and transaction histories) to a competitor or a personal data store with one click.  
* **Impact:** Breaks the monopolistic "network effects" of dominant platforms and fosters a competitive, innovative digital ecosystem.  

### 4.3. The Global Data Taxation Framework  

* **Policy:** A tax is levied on revenue from commercial use of large-scale personal and community data, with additional penalties for data hoarding (e.g., retaining non-essential data beyond consent periods).  
* **Funding Allocation:** Revenue flows into the **Treaty’s** Payment for Global Public Goods Fund (Pillar 4), with a significant portion earmarked for:  
  1. Funding the **Global Data Commons Trust**.  
  2. Investing in digital literacy and infrastructure in the Global South.  
  3. Providing resources for communities to build sovereign data infrastructure.  
  4. Supporting the **Love Ledger/Hearts currency** for equitable financial systems.  

### 4.4. The AI Training Data Transparency Mandate  

* **Policy:** Any entity developing or deploying a large-scale AI model must maintain a public, auditable registry of the datasets used for its training.  
* **Enforcement:** The Digital Justice Tribunal can levy massive fines and mandate model shutdowns if models use illegally sourced data, stolen IP, or non-consensual personal/community data.  

### 4.5. The Right to Repair Mandate  

* **Policy:** Platforms must provide tools and documentation for users to repair and modify data systems, aligning with Indigenous circular economies.  
* **Impact:** Reduces dependency on proprietary systems and promotes sustainability.  

### 4.6. Data Disarmament Incentive  

* **Policy:** Incentivizes corporations to delete non-essential data to reduce breach risks, offering tax credits or certification benefits.

  - Conduct global Indigenous consultations per the **Treaty’s** Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) requirements to shape the Digital Sovereignty Charter.  

* **Phase 1 (Years 1-3): Charter & Governance Formation**  
  - Ratify the Digital Sovereignty Charter through the reformed UNGA.  
  - Establish the Global Digital Governance Council (GDGC), Indigenous Data Sovereignty Council, and Youth Advisory Council.  
  - Launch pilot programs for Data Fiduciary certification in 3-5 "Digital Sanctuary" nations (e.g., Estonia, Costa Rica).  

* **Phase 2 (Years 4-7): Infrastructure & Enforcement**  
  - Build the technical and legal infrastructure for the Global Data Commons Trust.  
  - Operationalize the Digital Justice Tribunal and hear its first landmark cases.  
  - Mandate the "Right to Exit" protocols for all major tech platforms in Treaty-signatory nations.  

* **Phase 3 (Years 8+): Global Integration & Maturation**  
  - The Data Taxation Framework becomes a primary source of funding for global digital public goods.  
  - The Data Fiduciary standard becomes the global norm, shifting the digital economy to a trust-based model.  
  - Indigenous communities establish robust, sovereign data infrastructures.  
  - **Sunset Clause**: Obsolete provisions are phased out per the **Meta-Governance Framework’s** Liberatory Impermanence principle.

## 6. Synergies with Core Frameworks

* **Treaty for Our Only Home:** Provides the legal authority (Pillars 1 & 3) and funding mechanisms (Pillar 4) to make this governance regime binding and sustainable. The Data Taxation Framework directly supports Pillar 4’s Payment for Global Public Goods Fund.  
* **Meta-Governance Framework:** Provides the coordination architecture for the GDGC to interface with national regulators, corporations, and other global councils, ensuring digital governance integrates with crisis coordination protocols (e.g., cybersecurity or climate data sharing).  
* **Indigenous Governance Framework:** The primary vehicle for implementing **Indigenous Data Sovereignty** globally, ensuring the digital world does not repeat colonial extractive patterns. The Indigenous Data Sovereignty Council’s veto power and annual audits are non-negotiable.  
* **Planetary Health:** Provides rules for the **Global Pathogen Surveillance Network**, ensuring data (e.g., climate sensors) is shared for public good without violating sovereignty, using anonymized, consent-based protocols.  
* **Financial Systems & AUBI:** Provides the secure, private, and ethical data layer required for the **Love Ledger** and **Hearts currency** to function as tools of empowerment, not surveillance.
