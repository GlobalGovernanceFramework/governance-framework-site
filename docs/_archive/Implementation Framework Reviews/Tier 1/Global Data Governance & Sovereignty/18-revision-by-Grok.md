# Global Data Governance & Sovereignty Framework

**Tier:** 1 (Urgent Global Stability & Justice)  
**Status:** Revised Draft Outline  

---

## 1. Introduction: Stewarding the World's Collective Intelligence

**Vision:** To reframe data from a privately extracted commodity into a sacred trust—a reflection of our individual lives, community wisdom, and planetary health. This framework establishes a global order for data that protects digital dignity, enables innovation for public good, and ensures the benefits of the digital age are shared by all, not concentrated in the hands of a few.  
**Elevator Pitch:** This framework transforms data into a sacred trust, empowering individuals and communities, ensuring Indigenous sovereignty, and fostering ethical innovation for a just digital age, saving billions annually from data breaches ($4.45B in 2023).  
**User Story:** A user in Kenya opens their consent dashboard to revoke permissions for AI models trained on their community’s data, choosing instead to grant access via their regional cooperative for fair revenue, embodying the sacred trust of data sovereignty.

**Core Problem:** Humanity is navigating the 21st century with 20th-century rules for its most valuable resource. The current state is a digital wild west defined by data colonialism, surveillance capitalism, geopolitical weaponization (e.g., state-sponsored misinformation campaigns, foreign app data harvesting concerns like TikTok, Russian election interference), and fragmentation. Frameworks like GDPR fail to address AI training data loopholes (e.g., non-consensual data scraping), lack robust cross-border enforcement, and ignore the ecological impact of data infrastructure (e.g., data centers consuming 1-2% of global electricity). Data breaches cost an estimated $4.45 billion annually (2023 IBM report), eroding trust, undermining democracy, creating inequities, and leaving digital infrastructure vulnerable to collapse and manipulation. **Case Study:** In 2021, a major social media platform’s data breach exposed 533 million users’ personal data, highlighting the failure of consent-based models to prevent mass exploitation. This framework complements GDPR by exceeding its standards through the **GDPR+ Compatibility Standard**, ensuring enforceable global standards, Indigenous sovereignty, and ecological accountability.  

**Framework's Role:** This framework, the **Paris Agreement for the Digital Age**, provides the foundational "rules of the road" for the digital age, prioritizing ecological sustainability and justice. It is the prerequisite for governing AI, building the **Digital Commons**, and enabling frameworks like **Planetary Health**, **Financial Systems**, **AUBI**, and **Peace & Conflict** to function securely and ethically. It is enabled by the **Treaty for Our Only Home**, coordinated via the **Meta-Governance Framework**, and grounded in **Indigenous Data Sovereignty**.

## 2. Theory of Change

This framework achieves its vision through a clear causal chain:  
- **Mechanisms**: Implementing the **Data Fiduciary Standard**, **Right to Exit**, and **AI Training Data Transparency Mandate** shifts corporate incentives from exploitation to accountability.  
- **Immediate Outcomes**: These policies rebuild public trust, reduce data breaches, and empower communities with control over their data.  
- **Medium-Term Impacts**: Reduced breach costs (e.g., $4.45B annually), increased innovation through interoperable systems, and equitable data revenue distribution save billions and foster competition.  
- **Long-Term Vision**: A secure, equitable, and sustainable global digital economy that protects digital dignity, supports planetary health, and ensures justice for all, particularly marginalized communities.

## 3. Core Principles

* **Data as a Three-Fold Commons:** Data is not monolithic. This framework recognizes three distinct categories with different rights and responsibilities:  
  1. **Personal Data:** Generated by an individual (e.g., location data, biometric info, private messages). Belongs to the individual under self-sovereignty.  
  2. **Community & Cultural Data:** Generated by or representing a collective (e.g., water usage data from a village, ancestral oral histories, Indigenous Traditional Knowledge). Belongs to the collective under community sovereignty.  
  3. **Public & Environmental Data:** Data that is a global public good (e.g., NASA climate models, earthquake sensor networks, public genomic sequences). To be stewarded for the benefit of all humanity and the planet.  

* **Digital Dignity & Sovereignty:** Every individual and community has an inalienable right to control their digital identity and data, including anonymity, algorithmic transparency, and protection from non-consensual use. **Indigenous Data Sovereignty** is a cornerstone of the global data architecture.  

* **Fiduciary Responsibility:** Entities holding personal or community data have a legally binding duty to prioritize data subjects’ interests over commercial or political gains.  

* **Interoperability by Consent:** Data systems must enable innovation through secure, consent-driven interoperability, not default open access.  

* **Epistemic Justice:** Governance must dismantle knowledge hierarchies, valuing Indigenous, traditional, and community knowledge equitably.  

* **Accountability & Redress:** Data-related harms (e.g., privacy breaches, algorithmic bias) must have clear, enforceable pathways to justice and restitution.  

* **Ecological Sustainability:** Data infrastructure must minimize environmental impact (e.g., energy consumption, e-waste) and promote regenerative digital infrastructure (e.g., renewable-powered data centers, circular hardware lifecycles) aligned with **Planetary Health Framework** metrics (e.g., carbon neutrality, biodiversity impact).  

* **Temporal Data Rights:** Data retention periods must be defined based on data type (e.g., personal data deleted after consent expires, public data retained for scientific value), balancing utility and privacy.  

* **Data Minimalism:** Systems must collect only essential data, incentivizing minimal data practices to reduce risks and ecological footprint.

### 4.3. The Global Data Commons Trust  

* **Function:** Stewards **Public & Environmental Data** for research and public good using technologies like blockchain or DAOs (e.g., cryptographic audit trails, smart contracts with community oversight, or modular civic-tech platforms, based on **technological maturity thresholds**—e.g., blockchain only where scalable, secure, and community-verified to prevent greenwashing) to prevent bureaucratic capture.  
* **Governance:** Transparent board of scientific, ethical, and community leaders, ensuring planetary health data is shared without exploitation (e.g., via anonymized, consent-based protocols).  

### 4.4. The Digital Justice Tribunal  

* **Function:** A court under the **Treaty’s** Pillar 3 (Strengthening Global Law & Enforcement).  
* **Jurisdiction:** Covers crimes against digital dignity (e.g., mass surveillance), systemic data rights violations, sovereignty disputes, and misuse of Global Data Commons Trust data. Advised by the **Office of Algorithmic Accountability** on algorithmic bias cases.  

### 4.5. Regional Data Stewardship Councils  

* **Function:** Adapt global principles to local cultural and regulatory contexts while maintaining interoperability. Operate under subsidiarity thresholds (e.g., regional councils handle local disputes unless they impact >2 regions, escalating to GDGC).  
* **Composition:** Regional representatives from communities, governments, and technical experts, ensuring alignment with GDGC standards.  
* **Powers:** Implement localized data policies, support small-scale community governance, and mediate regional data disputes.
