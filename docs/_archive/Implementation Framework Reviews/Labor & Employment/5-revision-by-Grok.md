# Work in Liberation: A Radical Labour & Employment Governance Framework

## Executive Summary: A Day in the Life, 2045
Imagine waking up in 2045 in a Nairobi Bioregional Autonomy Zone (BAZ). You’re not rushing to a job to pay bills—your Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) of $3,000/month, boosted by 20% for caregiving, ensures your needs are met. Today, you choose to contribute: two hours mentoring youth through a Labour Matching App earns you *Hearts* credits, which you trade for locally grown food. Later, you join your Autonomous Worker Syndicate to restore a nearby wetland, earning Stewardship Credits that enhance your AUBI. Your neurodiverse schedule, shaped by *Crip Time*, gives you flexibility to rest. In the evening, you attend a "Great Recalibration" ceremony, celebrating community contributions with music and storytelling. This is liberated work: no bosses, no exploitation—just care, creativity, and planetary healing, governed by worker-led councils and ethical AI. By 2050, 90% of people live this way, with 70% of jobs regenerating ecosystems, guided by the Planetary Stewardship Index. *Work in Liberation* makes this future real, blending Indigenous wisdom, disability justice, and post-work innovation to end wage slavery and nurture thriving communities.

**Visual Aid**:  
- **Description**: A spiral infographic illustrating labour liberation stages:  
  - **Inner Ring**: "Survival Labour" (wage slavery).  
  - **Middle Ring**: "Sovereign Labour" (AUBI, *Hearts*, Purpose-Driven Volunteering).  
  - **Outer Ring**: "Life-Making Labour" (ecosocial harmony, planetary stewardship).  
- **Implementation**: Interactive digital version at `workinliberation.org/spiral` (launch Q2 2026), with SVG downloads and a thumbnail mockup showing the spiral with icons for care, ecology, and creativity.

## Introduction: Redefining Labour for a Post-Work Future
**Vision**: *"From exploited labour to liberated work—where every act of labour honours dignity, nurtures community, and regenerates the planet, transcending compulsory employment for voluntary, life-centered contributions."*

This framework reimagines labour as voluntary, purpose-driven contributions within ecological communities. It integrates **post-capitalist labour models**, **disability justice** (Radical Disability Rights Framework, filename: 11-revision-by-Grok.md), **Indigenous sovereignty** (Financial Systems Framework, filename: 22-revision-by-Grok.md), and **ecological regeneration**, building on *Hearts* currency, Love Ledger (Financial Systems Framework), Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) (Aging Population Support Framework, filename: 13-revision-by-Claude.md), Bioregional Autonomy Zones (BAZs) (Indigenous Framework), and the Post-Work Framework (filename: 2-further-ideas-from-Björn-Kenenth-Holmström-and-DeepSeek.md) with its **Post-Labor Transition Protocol**, **Contribution Ecosystems**, **Planetary Stewardship Index**, **Autonomous Worker Syndicates**, and **AI-Human Symbiosis Framework**.

**System Map**:  
- **Description**: A one-page diagram linking *Hearts* (care currency), AUBI (income floor), BAZs (local governance), AI-Symbiosis (ethical automation), Love Ledger (care tracking), BWCs (work councils), and GLA (global assembly). Arrows show flows to outcomes: stewardship, wellbeing, creative output.  
- **Implementation**: Available as an interactive SVG at `workinliberation.org/system-map` (launch Q2 2026), with a thumbnail mockup showing nodes and flows.

## 1. Core Principles
1. **Labour as Life-Making**  
   - Redefine "work" as **care, creativity, and ecological stewardship**, tracked via *Hearts* and Love Ledger (Financial Systems Framework, Section 3).  
   - **Decouple survival from wage labour** through AUBI with contribution multipliers (Aging Framework, Section 1.1; Post-Work Framework, Section 2.1).  

2. **Sovereignty Over Time & Body**  
   - **Right to refuse work** without penalty, with accommodations for disability (*Crip Time*, Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 2) and climate strike protections.  
   - Mandate **4-day workweeks** by 2030, with flexible scheduling (*Crip Time*) and a **15-hour/week contribution ceiling** (Post-Work Framework, Section 6.1).  

3. **Plural Economies of Value**  
   - **Hybrid compensation**: Fiat, *Hearts*, *Leaves* (Financial Systems Framework, Section 12.1) (e.g., 50% fiat, 30% *Hearts*, 20% care/ecological credits).  
   - **Indigenous protocols**: *Ayni* (reciprocal labour), potlatch (gift economies) (Financial Systems Framework, Section 1.1).  
   - **Contribution Pluralism**: Value care, knowledge sharing, creativity via Purpose-Driven Volunteering (Post-Work Framework, Section 3.2).  

4. **Post-Human Solidarity**  
   - Tax **AI and robot labour** (30% productivity gains) for AUBI (Financial Systems Framework, Section 15; Post-Work Framework, Section 2.1).  
   - Grant **non-human labour rights**, e.g., ecosystem personhood with "rest" periods (Indigenous Framework).  
   - Implement **AI-Human Symbiosis Protocols** for human-defined values (Post-Work Framework, Section 4.2).  

5. **Abolition of Exploitative Systems**  
   - **Phase out gig economies** by 2035 with worker-owned platforms (Financial Systems Framework, Section 1).  
   - **Ban prison labour**, transition to restorative justice economies (Aging Framework, Section 2.2).  
   - **Sunset extractive industries** (e.g., fossil fuels by 2030, fast fashion by 2032) via Just Transition Protocols (Post-Work Framework, Section 3.1).  

## 2. Structural Components
### 2.1 Global Labour Assembly (GLA)
- **Composition**: 50% workers, 30% marginalized groups (disabled, Indigenous, migrant), 20% AI observers (Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 3.1).  
- **Powers**:  
  - Veto exploitative trade deals.  
  - Set **global labour standards** (e.g., 20:1 CEO-worker pay ratio).  
  - Govern *Hearts* exchanges (e.g., 1 hour childcare = 50 *Leaves*, Financial Systems Framework, Section 12.1).  
  - Oversee **Planetary Stewardship Markets** (Post-Work Framework, Section 2.3).  
- **Governance**: **Neural Democracy Interface** for real-time preference aggregation (Post-Work Framework, Section 4.2).  
- **Visual Aid**:  
  - **Prompt**: Flowchart of GLA: central node to worker councils, marginalized representatives, AI observers, Planetary Stewardship Markets, with arrows for veto power and *Hearts* allocation. Thumbnail mockup with color-coded nodes.

### 2.2 Bioregional Work Councils (BWCs)

  - **Prompt**: Network diagram of BWCs: nodes for cooperatives, care collectives, syndicates, Labour Matching App, linked by *Hearts*, *Leaves*, Stewardship Credits. Thumbnail mockup with ecosystem icons.

### 2.3 Adaptive Labour Contracts
- **Flexible Templates**:  
  - **Seasonal work**: Align with ecological cycles.  
  - **Project-based**: Self-determined hours for artists, caregivers, neurodiverse workers (*Crip Time*, Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 20).  
  - **Purpose-Driven Volunteering**: Fluid contributions (care, stewardship, creativity) with dynamic compensation (Post-Work Framework, Section 3.2).  
- **AI Co-Design**: Workers train algorithms for fair contracts, adhering to **Creativity Parity** (Post-Work Framework, Section 4.2).  

### 2.4 Reparative Economies
- **Colonialism Repair Bonds**: 5% corporate profit tax for Indigenous land rematriation, Black cooperative startups (Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 2).  
- **Care-weighted AUBI**: Extra *Hearts* (e.g., +20% for care, +30% for restoration, +50% for knowledge transmission, Post-Work Framework, Section 2.1).  
- **Reparations Fund**: 15% of AUBI from historical labour exploitation reparations (Post-Work Framework, Section 2.1).  

### 2.5 Work Dispute Systems
- **Labour Courts**:  
  - **AI mediators** (bias-audited, Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 5) and worker juries, using **Algorithmic Contribution Audit** (Post-Work Framework, Section 4.2).  
  - Enforce rulings via *Hearts* sanctions or **Crypto-Enabled Treasury** adjustments (Financial Systems Framework, Section 7; Post-Work Framework, Section 2.2).
