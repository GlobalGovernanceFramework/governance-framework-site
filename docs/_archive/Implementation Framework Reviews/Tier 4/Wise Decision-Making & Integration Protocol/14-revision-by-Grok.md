### **Version History:**
- **4.0 (Current):** Repositioned as Wise Decision-Making & Integration Protocol per Gemini’s instructions. Eliminated standalone Wisdom Councils, integrating SOPs into Meta-Governance councils, Digital Justice Tribunal, BAZ meetings, and Education Framework. Merged facilitation roles into Work in Liberation Framework, funded via AUBI. Made date-agnostic (e.g., "Phase 1–3" vs. "18-Month Framework"). Preserved granular details (e.g., Ethical Stress-Testing, Deep Listening, Paradox Navigation) in appendices.
- **3.0 (Previous):** Original GWGF with standalone Wisdom Councils and specific timelines.

## **Introduction**
- **Purpose**: Provide the universal methodology ("How") for wise decision-making across the global governance ecosystem, bridging MOS ("What" - ethical principles) and IDLP ("Who" - leader capacity). Enables ethical, equitable, and contemplative governance for complex challenges.
- **Scope**: Supplies standard operating procedures (SOPs) for Meta-Governance councils, Digital Justice Tribunal, BAZ community meetings, and Education Framework’s restorative justice circles. Covers philosophical rigor, contemplative practices, and equitable processes, with Indigenous wisdom and trauma-informed approaches.
- **Vision**: Governance reflects humanity’s deepest wisdom, balancing analytical rigor, contemplative depth, and equitable power distribution, fostering flourishing for all life.
- **Short-Term Vision (Phase 1–3)**: Embed SOPs in 50% of Meta-Governance councils, train 100,000 facilitators, and pilot wisdom processes in 20 BAZs.
- **Worst-Case Contingency**: If targets missed (<40% council adoption, <50,000 trained), scale 10 BAZ pilots, redirect $50M from Global Commons Fund. *See Appendix A: Contingency Plans.*
- **Synergy**: Integrates with Meta-Governance (SOPs for councils), Treaty (Digital Justice Tribunal), AUBI (funds facilitators), MOS (ethical grounding), IDLP (leader training), and Indigenous Frameworks (cultural wisdom).
- **Public Engagement**: Framework Family (Full, Light with contemplative visuals, Core, Technical), accessible formats (VR/AR, sign language, 10+ languages) by Phase 2, available at globalgovernanceframework.org/wisdom-protocol. *See Appendix B: Engagement Materials.*

## **Core Principles**
1. **Epistemic Pluralism**: Integrate analytical, experiential, somatic, cultural, and intuitive knowledge, prioritizing Indigenous and decolonized epistemologies.
2. **Productive Uncertainty**: Embrace "not knowing" as a decision-making asset, navigating incomplete data with rigor.
3. **Relational Intelligence**: Governance emerges from relationships among people, ecosystems, and future generations.
4. **Embodied Ethics**: Combine head, heart, and body wisdom, grounded in MOS principles.
5. **Equitable Power**: Amplify marginalized voices, counter elite capture.
6. **Adaptive Responsiveness**: Evolve processes based on feedback, with sunset clauses. *See Appendix C: Detailed Principles.*

---

## **Governance Integration**
- **Meta-Governance SOPs**:
  - **Role**: Provide SOPs (Ethical Stress-Testing, Assumption Audits, Deep Listening) for all Meta-Governance councils (Earth, Social Resilience, Planetary Health).
  - **Application**: Used for wicked problems (e.g., climate tipping points, AI ethics), ensuring contemplative and equitable decisions.
- **Digital Justice Tribunal**:
  - **Role**: Applies Ethical Stress-Testing to complex cases (e.g., resource disputes, AI violations).
  - **Tools**: Paradox Navigation, Justice Impact Audits.
- **BAZ Community Meetings**:
  - **Role**: Use Deep Listening Protocols for inclusive deliberation, with trauma-informed facilitation.
  - **Integration**: Aligns with Education Framework’s restorative justice circles.
- **Economic & Labor Integration**:
  - **Work in Liberation Framework**: Recognizes facilitation (e.g., trauma-informed facilitators, cultural liaisons) as valuable labor.
  - **AUBI**: Funds facilitators via Hearts, ensuring equitable access.
- **Ethical Grounding**:
  - **MOS**: Provides ethical principles for SOPs (e.g., multi-perspective ethics).
  - **IDLP**: Trains leaders to apply SOPs effectively.
- **Cultural Integration**: Incorporates Indigenous wisdom (e.g., Māori kaitiakitanga, Ubuntu) via Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Framework. *See Appendix D: Governance Details.*
