# Global Existential Risk Governance (GERG) Framework  
*(Revised Outline with Enhanced Pluralism and Simulation Theory Dismissal)*  

## 1. Scope of Governance  
The GERG framework addresses **actionable, evidence-based existential risks** with plausible pathways to global catastrophe. Risks must meet:  
- **Material or causal evidence** of potential occurrence.  
- **Capacity for human intervention** (prevention, mitigation, or resilience).  

**Risk Tiers**:  
- **Tier 1 (High Priority)**: Immediate, actionable risks (e.g., AI misalignment, nuclear warfare).  
- **Tier 2 (Medium Priority)**: Emerging or speculative risks with partial intervenability (e.g., quantum warfare, nanotech gray goo).  
- **Tier 3 (Low Priority)**: Philosophical or unactionable risks (e.g., simulation shutdown, false vacuum decay, rogue black holes).  

**Excluded from Active Governance (Tier 3)**:  
- **Simulation shutdown** (see Section 2).  
- **Theological/afterlife risks** (unfalsifiable).  
- **False vacuum decay** (no causal link to human activity).  
- **Rogue black holes** (speculative, non-intervenable).  

**Note**: Tier 3 risks are monitored via horizon scanning for potential reclassification if new evidence emerges.

## 2. Simulation Theory: Pragmatic Deprioritization  
**Rationale for Tier 3 Classification**:  
- **Non-Intervenability**: No known mechanism exists to prevent or mitigate a hypothetical simulation shutdown.  
- **Non-Verifiability**: The hypothesis is empirically untestable, placing it outside actionable governance.  
- **Pluralistic Respect**: Metaphysical perspectives—whether materialist, idealist, or simulationist—are valued as personal lenses but not prioritized for policy action.  

**Statement**:  
*"Simulation theory, while a thought-provoking concept, is deprioritized in GERG due to its non-intervenable and unverifiable nature. GERG focuses on risks where human agency can reduce suffering or prevent catastrophe, respecting diverse worldviews without requiring metaphysical consensus."*

- **Prevention**: Binding carbon-negative pledges; real-time tipping point monitoring.  
- **Mitigation**: Solar radiation management (last resort); ocean acidification countermeasures.  
- **Resilience**: Floating cities; drought-resistant crops; decentralized infrastructure.  

### E. Natural Catastrophes (Asteroid/Volcanic)  
- **Description**: Asteroid impact (>10km) or supervolcanic eruption causing global cooling.  
- **Prevention**: Spaceguard 2.0 for asteroid detection/deflection; volcanic monitoring systems.  
- **Mitigation**: Global sulfur-cooling reserve for volcanic winters.  
- **Resilience**: Underground agriculture bunkers; Svalbard 2.0 knowledge vaults.  

### F. Emerging Risks  
- **Quantum Warfare**: Encryption-breaking destabilization.  
  - **Prevention**: Quantum-resistant cryptography standards.  
  - **Mitigation**: Redundant financial/military systems.  
  - **Resilience**: Decentralized digital infrastructure.  
- **Nanotech Gray Goo**: Self-replicating nanobots consuming biomass.  
  - **Prevention**: Strict nanotech oversight; dual-use tech ethics reviews.  
  - **Mitigation**: Nanobot neutralization protocols.  
  - **Resilience**: Biomass recovery strategies.  
- **Global Epistemic Failure**: Coordinated disinformation eroding societal sensemaking.  
  - **Prevention**: Transparent information protocols; media literacy education.  
  - **Mitigation**: Decentralized knowledge verification networks.  
  - **Resilience**: Community-based truth-seeking initiatives.  
- **AI-Biotech Convergence**: Synergistic risks from combined AI and biotech advancements.  
  - **Prevention**: Cross-disciplinary oversight boards.  
  - **Mitigation**: Integrated risk assessment frameworks.  
  - **Resilience**: Modular response systems for hybrid threats.  

## 4. Governance Structure  
### A. Monitoring Bodies  
- **Existential Risk Observatory (ERO)**: Tiers risks by likelihood/severity using AI-driven models; conducts horizon scanning for Tier 3 risks.  
- **AI Alignment Board**: Audits frontier AI systems for dangerous capabilities.  
- **Pandemic Radar**: Global genomic surveillance for pathogen outbreaks.  
- **Climate Tipping Point Network**: Tracks methane releases, ice sheet stability.  

### B. Enforcement Mechanisms  
- **Existential Security Council (UN-ESC)**: Enacts binding resolutions on risky technologies.  
- **Global Response Teams**: Neutralize rogue bioweapons/AI actors.  
- **Space Governance Body**: Regulates asteroid deflection and orbital activities.  
- **Network-Based Governance Nodes**: Regional/local actors coordinate with global bodies for agile response.  

### C. Public Engagement & Legitimacy  
- **World Risk Assembly**: Citizen juries deliberate risk trade-offs, ensuring diverse representation.  
- **Existential Civics Education**: Mandatory curricula on catastrophic risks in schools globally.  
- **Media Advocacy**: Promote precautionary sci-fi and longtermist policies via entertainment and public campaigns.  
- **Civil Society Watchdogs**: Grassroots organizations monitor and provide feedback on governance efficacy.  

## 5. Resilience & Adaptation Strategies  
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Redundant grids, vertical farming, local energy systems.  
- **Global Knowledge Vaults**: Digital/physical backups of civilization’s knowledge (e.g., Svalbard 2.0).  
- **Post-Collapse Continuity**: Underground/off-world "arks" with **equity-based access frameworks** ensuring fair resource allocation.  
- **Psychological Resilience**: Training for rapid societal adaptation to catastrophic scenarios.  

## 6. Worldview-Sensitive Adaptation Layer (Optional)  
To accommodate diverse epistemologies (e.g., Indigenous, spiritual, systems thinking):  
- **Non-Attachment to Outcomes**: Reduces paralysis in crisis scenarios, inspired by consciousness-centric frameworks.  
- **Compassion-Driven Governance**: Ethical action rooted in shared humanity, adaptable to materialist or idealist worldviews.  
- **Indigenous Knowledge Integration**: Incorporate holistic risk perspectives from Indigenous communities.  
- **Metaphor for Unity**: *"Whether reality is a simulation, a dream, or a cosmic accident, the pain of a starving child is real enough to demand action."*

## 7. Implementation Roadmap  
- **Phase 1 (1-3 years)**: Establish ERO, UN-ESC, and monitoring systems; ratify AI Safety Accord and Biosecurity Pact; launch Existential Civics curricula.  
- **Phase 2 (3-10 years)**: Deploy decentralized infrastructure; expand Spaceguard 2.0; operationalize World Risk Assembly.  
- **Phase 3 (10+ years)**: Achieve global coordination; implement post-collapse continuity plans; refine equity protocols.  
- **Adaptive Governance**: Annual participatory foresight workshops and Delphi panels to update risk tiers and strategies.  

## 8. Notes for Further Development  
- **Policy Language**: Refine for **globalgovernanceframework.org** to target policymakers, emphasizing clarity and coalition-building.  
- **Experiential Tools**: Develop simulation-based training (e.g., risk scenario exercises) for GERG staff and stakeholders, replacing "Taoist Dwarf Fortress" for broader appeal.  
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Conduct global consultations with diverse groups (e.g., Indigenous communities, regional governments) to ensure inclusivity.  
- **Ethical Oversight**: Establish an ethics board to address dilemmas in resilience resource allocation.  

## Appendix A: Consciousness and Governance  
For stakeholders exploring consciousness-first models, GERG acknowledges that metaphysical frameworks can inform ethical action without dictating policy. Resources available at [globalgovernanceframework.org/philosophy].
