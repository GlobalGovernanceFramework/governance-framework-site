## **Introduction**
- **Purpose**: Serve as the emergency response and foresight protocol for existential risks, embedded across the global governance ecosystem, activating when civilization faces catastrophic threats (Tier 0/1 risks). Ensures survival through prevention, mitigation, and resilience.
- **Scope**: Addresses actionable existential risks (AI misalignment, biotech catastrophe, nuclear warfare, climate collapse, natural catastrophes, emerging risks) with global coordination, equity, and cultural sensitivity. Aligns with Treaty, UNCRPD, IPCC, and MOS *Dynamic Rights Spectrum*.
- **Vision**: By year 15, humanity is safeguarded against existential risks through integrated governance, equitable resilience, and proactive foresight, ensuring a regenerative civilization.
- **Short-Term Vision (year 1 to year 5)**: Establish Existential Risk Observatory (ERO), achieve 80% treaty adoption, train 100M in Existential Civics, and deploy resilience infrastructure in 50% of Priority Resilience Zones.
- **Worst-Case Contingency**: If targets missed (<60% treaty adoption, <50M trained), scale 20 BAZ pilots, redirect $10B from Global Commons Fund. *See Appendix A: Contingency Plans.*
- **Synergy**: Integrates with Meta-Governance (Crisis Command Protocol), Treaty (enforcement), AUBI (funding), Planetary Health (climate), Aurora Accord (tech), MOS (triage ethics), and Indigenous Frameworks (cultural resilience).
- **Public Engagement**: Framework Family (Full, Light, Core, Technical), accessible formats (VR/AR, sign language, 10+ languages) by year 2, available at globalgovernanceframeworks.org/planetary-immune-system. Mobile GERG Risk App for real-time risk data. *See Appendix B: Engagement Materials.*

---

## **Core Principles**
1. **Pragmatic Foresight**: Prioritize actionable, evidence-based risks (Tier 0/1/2).
2. **Equity & Justice**: Ensure Global South, Indigenous, and vulnerable populations lead and benefit.
3. **Transparency**: Public dashboards, citizen engagement via World Risk Assembly.
4. **Resilience**: Decentralized infrastructure, cultural preservation, psychological support.
5. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Integrate Indigenous wisdom (e.g., Māori kaitiakitanga, Ubuntu). *See Appendix C: Detailed Principles.*

---

## **Governance Integration**
- **Crisis Command Protocol**:
  - **Role**: Temporary configuration of Meta-Governance councils (Earth, Social Resilience, Planetary Health) as Existential Security Council (UN-ESC) when ERO declares Tier 0/1 crisis. Grants streamlined decision-making and emergency powers.
  - **Composition**: 50% Global South, 30% Indigenous/youth, transparent nominations, overseen by Independent Oversight Tribunal.
  - **Tools**: ERO risk models, *Mobile GERG Risk App*, blockchain-tracked decisions.
- **Enforcement**:
  - **Global Response Teams**: Elite units within Treaty’s Global Enforcement Mechanism, trained for existential threats (e.g., rogue AI lab shutdown, bio-leak response).
  - **Sanctions**: Patent revocation, trade restrictions for non-compliance, enforced via Digital Justice Tribunal.
- **Economic Integration**:
  - **Global Commons Fund**: Incorporates Sin Tax (1% on high-risk tech) and GERG Innovation Portfolio ($10B for AI alignment, asteroid defense).
  - **AUBI**: Funds resilience infrastructure (e.g., food stockpiles) via Layer 3.
- **Jurisdictional Thresholds**:
  - **Planetary Health**: Manages standard climate governance; Planetary Immune System activates for existential climate risks (e.g., tipping points).
  - **Aurora Accord**: Handles day-to-day AI/biotech ethics; Planetary Immune System oversees frontier, high-risk tech via AI Alignment Board, Biosecurity Pact.
  - **MOS**: Provides standard ethics; Planetary Immune System uses triage ethics for crisis decisions (e.g., bunker access). *See Appendix D: Governance Details.*
