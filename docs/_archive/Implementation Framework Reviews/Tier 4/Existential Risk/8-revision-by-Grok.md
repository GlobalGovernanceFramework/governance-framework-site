# Global Existential Risk Governance (GERG) Framework  
*(The WHO for Existential Risks: Enhanced Final Outline)*  

## 1. Scope of Governance  
The GERG framework, branded as **"The WHO for Existential Risks"**, addresses **actionable, evidence-based existential risks** with plausible pathways to global catastrophe. Risks must meet:  
- **Material or Causal Evidence**: Supported by empirical data or causal models (e.g., historical precedents, scientific projections).  
- **Capacity for Human Intervention**: Viable prevention, mitigation, or resilience strategies exist.  

**Risk Tiers**:  
- **Tier 1 (High Priority)**: Immediate, actionable risks with high likelihood/severity (e.g., AI misalignment, nuclear warfare).  
- **Tier 2 (Medium Priority)**: Emerging risks with partial intervenability (e.g., quantum warfare, self-replicating nanotech).  
- **Tier 3 (Watchlist)**: Philosophical or unactionable risks (e.g., simulation shutdown, false vacuum decay).  

**Watchlist Risks (Tier 3)**: Monitored via horizon scanning for reclassification if new evidence emerges.  
- **Simulation shutdown** (see Section 2).  
- **Theological/afterlife risks** (unfalsifiable).  
- **False vacuum decay** (no causal link to human activity).  
- **Rogue black holes** (speculative, non-intervenable).  

**Risk-Assessment Flowchart for Tier Reclassification**:  
1. **Evidence Check**: Is there empirical data or a causal model? (Yes → Proceed; No → Tier 3)  
2. **Intervenability Check**: Are prevention/mitigation strategies feasible? (Yes → Tier 1/2; No → Tier 3)  
3. **Impact Assessment**: Quantify likelihood (e.g., >1% in 50 years) and severity (e.g., >50% population loss).  
4. **Public Petitioning**: Allow academic/civil society petitions for reclassification, reviewed annually by ERO.

## 2. Simulation Theory: Pragmatic Deprioritization  
**Rationale for Tier 3 Classification**:  
- **Non-Intervenability**: No known mechanism exists to influence a hypothetical simulation shutdown (quantified as 0% actionable control).  
- **Non-Verifiability**: Lacks empirical testability or falsifiable predictions.  
- **Pluralistic Respect**: GERG respects diverse worldviews (materialist, idealist, simulationist) but prioritizes shared, evidence-based action thresholds.  

**Statement**:  
*"Simulation theory, while a compelling academic exercise, is deprioritized in GERG due to its non-intervenable and unverifiable nature. GERG focuses on risks where human agency can reduce suffering or prevent catastrophe, without requiring metaphysical consensus."*  

**Footnote**: For academic exploration of consciousness-first models or other metaphysical frameworks, see [Appendix A](#appendix-a) or [globalgovernanceframework.org/philosophy]. These are not GERG policy positions.

- **Regional Disparities**: Prioritize funding for climate-vulnerable and low-resource regions via Global South Resilience Fund.  

## 6. Worldview-Sensitive Adaptation Layer  
To accommodate diverse epistemologies:  
- **Non-Attachment to Outcomes**: Reduces crisis paralysis, inspired by consciousness-centric frameworks.  
- **Compassion-Driven Governance**: Ethical action rooted in shared humanity.  
- **Indigenous Knowledge Integration**: Incorporate holistic perspectives (e.g., **Māori kaitiakitanga**, **Islamic stewardship (khilafah)**, **African ubuntu**, **Confucian harmony**) for global legitimacy.  
- **Metaphor for Unity**: *"Whether reality is a simulation, a dream, or a cosmic accident, the pain of a starving child is real enough to demand action."*

## 7. Implementation Roadmap  
- **Phase 1 (2026-2028)**:  
  - Establish ERO, UN-ESC, Global South Advisory Council; ratify AI Safety Accord and Biosecurity Pact within **12 months**.  
  - Launch Existential Civics in 50% of UN member states (ages 12+, 10+ languages).  
  - Pilot Citizen Resilience Program in 10 countries (e.g., Iceland, Kenya).  
  - Initiate **Coalition of the Willing** with 20+ nations for transitional governance.  
  - **Capacity-Building**: Fund policy infrastructure in low-resource nations.  
- **Phase 2 (2028-2035)**:  
  - Deploy decentralized infrastructure; expand Spaceguard 2.0.  
  - Operationalize World Risk Assembly (100+ countries).  
  - Implement sin tax on high-risk tech.  
- **Phase 3 (2035+)**:  
  - Achieve global coordination; refine equity protocols for arks.  
  - Scale resilience programs globally.  
- **Adaptive Governance**: Annual foresight workshops/Delphi panels; **KPIs** (e.g., 80% treaty adoption by 2030, 50% reduction in unaligned AI projects by 2035).  
- **Fallback Plan**: If treaty adoption lags, pivot to **resilience-first track** (e.g., prioritize decentralized infrastructure, regional coalitions).

## 8. Notes for Further Development  
- **Policy Language**: Optimized for **globalgovernanceframework.org**, emphasizing clarity, urgency, and coalition-building.  
- **Experiential Tools**: Develop **simulation engine for nation-state scenario modeling** (e.g., AI-driven risk scenarios) with **Taoist Dwarf Fortress** as an easter egg for staff engagement.  
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Conduct consultations with Indigenous communities, regional governments, and youth groups.  
- **Ethical Oversight**: **Ethics Board** to address dilemmas in resource allocation (e.g., ark access).  
- **UN Reform**: Propose **UNSC veto power** for UN-ESC on existential risk resolutions.  
- **Language Localization**: Translate training materials into 10+ languages (e.g., Arabic, Mandarin, Swahili) by 2028.  
- **Justice Layer**: Tie GERG to reparations and intergenerational equity discussions (see Appendix C).  
- **Open Science**: Mandate open-source models and transparent data-sharing for AI/biotech risk assessments.

## Appendix A: Consciousness and Governance  
For academic exploration of consciousness-first models or other metaphysical frameworks, GERG acknowledges their ethical inspiration without endorsing as policy. See [globalgovernanceframework.org/philosophy].

## Appendix B: Model Treaty Article for UN-ESC  
**Article 1: Enforcement Powers**  
1. The Existential Security Council (UN-ESC), a UNSC sub-body, issues binding resolutions on existential risks (e.g., moratoriums on unaligned AGI, gain-of-function research).  
2. Member states comply via economic sanctions, asset freezes, or Global Response Team interventions.  
3. Non-compliance triggers UNSC review, with UN-ESC veto power for existential risk matters.  
4. Funding via sin tax on high-risk technologies (e.g., 1% tax on AI compute >10^18 FLOPS, synthetic biology equipment).  

## Appendix C: Justice and Intergenerational Equity  
GERG commits to:  
- **Reparative Justice**: Prioritize resilience funding for historically disadvantaged regions (e.g., post-colonial nations).  
- **Intergenerational Equity**: Ensure future generations’ needs guide resource allocation (e.g., long-term seed vaults, knowledge preservation).  
- **Transparency**: Annual public reports on equity metrics (e.g., % of resilience funds to Global South).

---

This framework is **pragmatic**, **equitable**, **enforceable**, and **globally inclusive**, uniting stakeholders to prevent and survive existential risks. It balances bold vision with actionable steps, ensuring transparency, justice, and resilience for all regions.
