# Final Enhanced Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health Governance

## Executive Summary
The **Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health** is a transformative, rights-based framework prioritizing psychosocial flourishing, equity, and planetary well-being. This final revision integrates comprehensive clinical outcomes, inter-governmental coordination, technology governance, and change management, ensuring implementation readiness. Key priorities include:
- **Quick Wins:** Integrate mental health into Universal Health Coverage (UHC) with ≥5% budget allocation, pilot community-led task forces in 3-5 diverse regions, and deploy a Global Mental Health Watchdog with a Traffic Light System.
- **Long-Term Shifts:** Transition to rights-based care, establish a Global Mental Health Commons Fund, and embed mental health in climate and future-of-work policies with detailed implementation guides.
- **Monitoring & Accountability:** Use flourishing metrics, community-led monitoring, and a Transparency Dashboard with audited AI tools, robust data protection, and specific performance benchmarks.

## Quick Start Guide
1. **Integrate Mental Health into UHC:** Mandate ≥5% of national health budgets, enforced via trade incentives and a **Path to Compliance Checklist** (policy reform, training, budget increase).
2. **Pilot Community-Led Task Forces:** Launch in 3-5 diverse regions (e.g., urban Africa, rural Asia, indigenous Americas) with **Cultural Adaptation Toolkit** and centralized fallbacks.
3. **Establish Global Mental Health Watchdog:** Implement a Traffic Light System (🟩 Green = compliant, 🟨 Yellow = partial, 🟥 Red = sanctions) with **performance benchmarks** (e.g., 80% access to care, 50% stigma reduction).

## Principles in Practice Sidebar
