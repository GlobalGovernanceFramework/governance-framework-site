  - Community-based mediation for local conflicts.

## 4. Implementation Mechanisms
- **Capacity Building**:
  - Training programs for judges, lawyers, and mediators on global standards.
  - Technology integration for case management and transparency (e.g., blockchain for court records).
- **Funding and Resources**:
  - Global justice fund, supported by member state contributions and international organizations.
  - Prioritization of funding for under-resourced regions.
- **Technology and Innovation**:
  - AI-driven legal research tools for equitable access to legal precedents.
  - Virtual courtrooms for remote access to justice.

## 5. Monitoring and Accountability
- **Performance Metrics**:
  - Case resolution times, accessibility rates, and public trust indices.
  - Regular audits of judicial independence and fairness.
- **Transparency Mechanisms**:
  - Publicly accessible case databases.
  - Annual justice system performance reports.
- **Corrective Measures**:
  - Independent review boards for judicial misconduct.

## 7. Challenges and Mitigation Strategies
- **Cultural and Legal Diversity**:
  - Mitigation: Flexible frameworks with room for local adaptation.
- **Resource Disparities**:
  - Mitigation: Tiered funding models and technology transfers.
- **Political Resistance**:
  - Mitigation: Diplomatic engagement and incentivized compliance.

## 8. Timeline and Milestones
- **Year 1**: Establish global oversight body, draft core legal standards.
- **Year 2-3**: Set up regional hubs, pilot implementation in select jurisdictions.
- **Year 4-5**: Scale globally, integrate technology, and publish first performance report.
- **Ongoing**: Continuous evaluation and adaptation.

## 9. Conclusion
- **Vision**: A global justice system that upholds fairness, fosters trust, and adapts to evolving global needs.
- **Call to Action**: Stakeholders to collaborate on refining and implementing the framework.
