I think we can enhance the Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework while simultaneously creating an index file similar to the others. Let me outline how I'd improve the framework to reach 100/100, then create a structured index file that aligns with your established format.

## Framework Improvements

Your Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework is already strong at 94/100, but could benefit from these enhancements:

1. **Seed Kit Reference**: The framework currently lacks mention of a Seed Kit, which is a consistent feature across your other frameworks.

2. **Implementation Tooling**: While there are "Implementation Tools" mentioned throughout, they need more structured organization and accessibility instructions.

3. **Visual Components**: Add a section about planned visual components (diagrams, infographics) like in the other frameworks.

4. **SDG Alignment**: Strengthen explicit connections to relevant Sustainable Development Goals.

5. **Regional Customization**: Expand the regional approach beyond case studies to include specific implementation pathways for different contexts.

6. **Metrics & Evaluation**: Create a more comprehensive monitoring and evaluation section with specific KPIs.
