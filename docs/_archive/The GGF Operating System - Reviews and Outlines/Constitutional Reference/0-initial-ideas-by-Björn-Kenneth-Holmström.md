I have begun developing Global Governance Frameworks (globalgovernanceframework.org), an organization for solving the planets polycrisis by creating solutions to all relevant areas.


Facing the scale of the issues and the immense resources required to handle and coordinate everything, I am thinking we need a framework or (maybe you have a better term) other document structure detailing the organization (how it should operate, and be organized).

We should uphold values such as truth, transparency, ethical conduct, community participation, epistemic humility. We should use best practice for all coding, leveraging tools such as git, and keeping our content open source. We could also be based on the LMCI (Love, meaning, connection index) for our participants and all extended connections to prosper. We should also be optimized based on the positive aspects of all the levels of spiral dynamics (from beige to clear). The structure of the organization should be as lean and modular as possible. We should leverage the most optimal tools for each task, such as the state of the art LLMs as advisors, the best media platforms for outreach, the best platforms for community participation (for example Discord), but also open gatherings in nature.

We should also be open to the eventual dissolution of the organization, when humanity and the planet have reached a high enough development to continue without it.


Thoughts, any additions you think are valuable before we draft a framework outline for the organization's organization?
