# GGF Operating System (GGF-OS v2.0)

This document is the constitution, manifesto, and operational guide for the Global Governance Framework (GGF). It is a public, living document, hosted on a Git repository, and subject to participatory revision processes. The GGF-OS embodies the principles it promotes, acting as a prototype for resilient, participatory governance designed to foster collective flow and minimize egoic friction.

---

## 0. Preamble: The Call & The Commitment

### The Polycrisis Imperative
Humanity faces interconnected global crises—climate change, inequality, conflict, and technological disruption—that demand coordinated, systemic responses. These challenges threaten the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants, requiring adaptive, inclusive governance grounded in shared stewardship.

### Our Response: A Guild of Stewards
The GGF exists to co-create, curate, and disseminate open-source governance frameworks for planetary well-being. We are a global network of contributors collaboratively designing systems that foster resilience, equity, and sustainability.

### Our Compass: Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI)
GGF’s success is measured by the flourishing of its members and the communities it serves, assessed through a holistic index: Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI). Labs define 2-3 specific, measurable indicators aligned with LMCI to track their impact.

### Our Foundation: Integrated & Evolving Consciousness
Our work integrates healthy expressions of all levels of human consciousness, inspired by Spiral Dynamics:
- **Beige:** Ensuring physical security and survival needs.
- **Purple:** Fostering community belonging and cultural cohesion.
- **Red:** Encouraging bold action and individual agency.
- **Blue:** Upholding shared values and disciplined execution.
- **Orange:** Driving innovation and strategic effectiveness.
- **Green:** Promoting inclusivity and empathy.
- **Yellow/Turquoise:** Embracing systemic, holistic integration.
- **Coral:** Actively creating space for paradigm-breaking innovation, fostering unforeseen models of governance and collaboration that may challenge this framework itself. This ethos ensures GGF remains a catalyst for continuous evolution, avoiding dogmatism.

## 1. Core Principles

These principles guide GGF’s internal operations, designed to enable collective flow and reduce egoic attachment.

### Radical Transparency
All non-private operational data—finances, decision logs, project roadmaps—are publicly accessible via platforms like OpenCollective.

### Subsidiarity & Polycentrism
GGF is a modular network of autonomous Working Groups (Labs). Decision-making is localized to Labs, with a Stewards Circle coordinating network-wide functions.

### Direct & Deliberative Participation
All members have a voice. Decision-making uses a tiered model:
- **Consensus** for charter amendments.
- **Consent** for operational decisions.
- **Individual autonomy** for personal tasks.
Digital tools like Loomio and Pol.is enable scalable deliberation.

### Epistemic Humility & Open Inquiry
We foster curiosity over certainty. An internal “Office of the Adversary” challenges assumptions, and all work is versioned (e.g., v1.8) to encourage iteration. The Office operates with rotating contributors, selected via open nomination and consent-based processes, intervening at least quarterly to critique strategies, propose creative alternatives, and ensure balance between critique and collaboration. Interventions may be anonymous to encourage candid feedback.

### Ethical Tooling
We prioritize tools that are free, open-source, privacy-respecting, and decentralized, while allowing pragmatic use of proprietary tools when necessary, guided by a clear selection protocol (see Section 3.5).

### Graceful Obsolescence
GGF is a scaffold, not a monument. A “Sunset Protocol” defines conditions for dissolving or transitioning the organization when its mission is fulfilled. For long-term projects, the protocol ensures knowledge transfer and continuity through open-source licensing and documentation to prevent disruption.

### Principle of Reversibility
Decisions are reversible where possible, with review periods and rollback plans to adapt to unintended consequences, supporting epistemic humility.

### Relational Integrity
We commit to fostering psychological safety and compassionate collaboration:
- **Assume Good Faith:** Contributors assume positive intent in disagreements.
- **Compassionate Communication:** Interactions use Nonviolent Communication, focusing on needs and feelings, reviewed for cultural sensitivity to decolonize knowledge and prioritize non-Western governance models.
- **Mediation Support:** Labs designate trained mediators to facilitate conversations before escalation.

---

## 2. Organizational Structure

GGF operates as a holarchy—a system of nested, autonomous units—designed to minimize egoic attachment through fluid roles and collective ownership.

### A. Working Groups (Labs)
- **Purpose:** Core operational units aligned with GGF domains, organized as Core or Emergent Labs (see Section 7).
- **Autonomy:** Labs manage projects, budgets, and teams, adhering to GGF-OS.
- **Operation:** Labs define internal processes, aligning with Charter principles.
- **Scaling:** Labs exceeding a dynamic size threshold (e.g., 20 contributors or based on project complexity) split per the Fractal Scaling Protocol (see Section 3.7).
- **Feedback Loops:** Labs provide quarterly feedback to the Stewards Circle via reports and open forums.
- **Accountability:** Labs undergo a Lab Health Review Protocol (see Section 3.13) to support performance and alignment.

### B. Roles
- **Contributors:** Individuals contributing code, content, facilitation, or resources, recognized for work, not titles.
- **Lab Stewards:** One or two rotating coordinators per Lab, responsible for communication, Charter adherence, project oversight, and monitoring burnout, encouraging collective breaks between sprints.
- **Stewards Circle:** A rotating body of one steward per Lab, tasked with:
  1. Resource allocation.
  2. Cross-Lab coordination.
  3. Charter guardianship.
  4. External communications.
  5. Coordinating external threat responses (see Section 3.8).
  - **Term Limits:** Stewards serve two-year terms, with one year off before re-eligibility.
- **Support Guild:** A specialized Lab managing interactions with centralized systems:
  - **Mandate:** Insulate Labs from bureaucratic constraints, handle legal incorporation, banking, contracts, compliance, international legal monitoring, and annual environmental impact assessments of GGF operations.
  - **Operation:** Operates autonomously, reporting transparently to the Stewards Circle.
- **Fork Mediation Guild:** A specialized Lab facilitating equitable asset splits and dialogue during forks, including intellectual property disputes, ensuring relational integrity (see Section 6.1).
- **Guardian Council:** A diverse group (3-5 members) upholding GGF principles without executive authority.
  - **Selection:** Chosen via consent after an open nomination period accessible to all contributors, ensuring democratic legitimacy, based on their wisdom and alignment with GGF principles.
  - **Terms:** Staggered three-year terms.
