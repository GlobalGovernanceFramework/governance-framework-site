# GGF Operating System (GGF-OS v2.2)

This document is the constitution, manifesto, and operational guide for the Global Governance Framework (GGF). It is a public, living document, hosted on a Git repository, and subject to participatory revision processes. The GGF-OS embodies the principles it promotes, acting as a prototype for resilient, participatory governance designed to foster collective flow and minimize egoic friction.

---

## 0. Preamble: The Call & The Commitment

### The Polycrisis Imperative
Humanity faces interconnected global crises—climate change, inequality, conflict, and technological disruption—that demand coordinated, systemic responses. These challenges threaten the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants, requiring adaptive, inclusive governance grounded in shared stewardship.

### Our Response: A Guild of Stewards
The GGF exists to co-create, curate, and disseminate open-source governance frameworks for planetary well-being. We are a global network of contributors collaboratively designing systems that foster resilience, equity, and sustainability.

### Our Compass: Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI)
GGF’s success is measured by the flourishing of its members and the communities it serves, assessed through a holistic index: Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI). Labs define 2-3 specific, measurable indicators aligned with LMCI to track their impact.

### Our Foundation: Integrated & Evolving Consciousness
Our work integrates healthy expressions of all levels of human consciousness, inspired by Spiral Dynamics:
- **Beige:** Ensuring physical security and survival needs.
- **Purple:** Fostering community belonging and cultural cohesion.
- **Red:** Encouraging bold action and individual agency.
- **Blue:** Upholding shared values and disciplined execution.
- **Orange:** Driving innovation and strategic effectiveness.
- **Green:** Promoting inclusivity and empathy.
- **Yellow/Turquoise:** Embracing systemic, holistic integration.
- **Coral:** Actively creating space for paradigm-breaking innovation, fostering unforeseen models of governance and collaboration that may challenge this framework itself. This ethos ensures GGF remains a catalyst for continuous evolution, avoiding dogmatism.

---

## 1. Core Principles

These principles guide GGF’s internal operations, designed to enable collective flow and reduce egoic attachment.

### Radical Transparency
All non-private operational data—finances, decision logs, project roadmaps—are publicly accessible via platforms like OpenCollective.

### Subsidiarity & Polycentrism
GGF is a modular network of autonomous Working Groups (Labs). Decision-making is localized to Labs, with a Stewards Circle coordinating network-wide functions.

### Direct & Deliberative Participation
All members have a voice. Decision-making uses a tiered model:
- **Consensus** for charter amendments.
- **Consent** for operational decisions.
- **Individual autonomy** for personal tasks.
Digital tools like Loomio and Pol.is enable scalable deliberation.

### Epistemic Humility & Open Inquiry
We foster curiosity over certainty. An internal “Office of the Adversary” challenges assumptions, with rotating contributors selected via open nomination and consent-based processes, intervening at least quarterly to critique strategies, propose creative alternatives, and ensure balance between critique and collaboration. Interventions may be anonymous to encourage candid feedback. The Office operates as a rotating function, potentially integrated with Guardian Council responsibilities, to maintain agility.

### Ethical Tooling
We prioritize free, open-source, privacy-respecting, decentralized tools, allowing pragmatic use of proprietary tools when necessary, guided by a selection protocol (see Section 3.5).

### Graceful Obsolescence
GGF is a scaffold, not a monument. A “Sunset Protocol” ensures dissolution or transition when the mission is fulfilled, with knowledge transfer via open-source licensing for long-term projects.

### Principle of Reversibility
Decisions are reversible where possible, with review periods and rollback plans to adapt to unintended consequences, supporting epistemic humility.

### Principle of Reciprocal Gifting: 
The GGF operates within a gift economy ethos. We recognize that contributions are gifts of time, energy, and wisdom to the commons. The GGF, in turn, reciprocates by gifting back to its contributors through open access to knowledge, "Growth Support" opportunities, and by stewarding the collective work for planetary benefit. This principle fosters a non-transactional culture of mutual support.

### Relational Integrity
We commit to fostering psychological safety and compassionate collaboration:
- **Assume Good Faith:** Contributors assume positive intent in disagreements.
- **Compassionate Communication:** Interactions use Nonviolent Communication, focusing on needs and feelings, reviewed for cultural sensitivity to decolonize knowledge and prioritize non-Western governance models, including explicit references to Indigenous governance principles such as consensus-based decision-making and relational accountability.
- **Mediation Support:** Labs designate trained mediators to facilitate conversations before escalation.

### Climate Justice & Environmental Stewardship
All operations prioritize climate justice, ensuring environmental impact assessments are integrated into decision-making, funding allocations, and tool selections to minimize carbon footprints and promote ecological resilience.

---

## 2. Organizational Structure

GGF operates as a holarchy—a system of nested, autonomous units—designed to minimize egoic attachment through fluid roles and collective ownership.

### A. Working Groups (Labs)
- **Purpose:** Core operational units aligned with GGF domains, organized as Core, Emergent, or Innovation Labs (see Section 7).
- **Autonomy:** Labs manage projects, budgets, and teams, adhering to GGF-OS.
- **Operation:** Labs define internal processes, aligning with Charter principles.
- **Scaling:** Labs exceeding a dynamic size threshold (e.g., based on project complexity or contributor count, typically 20+) split per the Fractal Scaling Protocol (see Section 3.7).
- **Feedback Loops:** Labs provide quarterly feedback to the Stewards Circle via reports and open forums.
- **Accountability:** Labs undergo a Lab Health Review Protocol (see Section 3.13) to support performance and alignment.

### B. Roles
- **Contributors:** Individuals contributing code, content, facilitation, or resources, recognized for work, not titles.
- **Lab Stewards:** One or two rotating coordinators per Lab, responsible for communication, Charter adherence, project oversight, and monitoring burnout, encouraging collective breaks between sprints.
- **Stewards Circle:** A rotating body of one steward per Lab, tasked with:
  1. Resource allocation.
  2. Cross-Lab coordination.
  3. Charter guardianship.
  4. External communications.
  5. Coordinating external threat responses (see Section 3.8).
  - **Term Limits:** Stewards serve two-year terms, with one year off before re-eligibility.
- **Support Guild:** A specialized Lab managing interactions with centralized systems:
  - **Mandate:** Insulate Labs from bureaucratic constraints, handle legal incorporation, banking, contracts, compliance, international legal monitoring, and annual environmental impact assessments of GGF operations.
  - **Operation:** Operates autonomously, reporting transparently to the Stewards Circle.
- **Fork Mediation Guild:** A specialized Lab facilitating equitable asset splits and dialogue during forks, including intellectual property disputes, ensuring relational integrity (see Section 6.1). This Guild may merge with the Support Guild if operational overlap occurs to streamline functions.
- **Guardian Council:** A diverse group (3-5 members) upholding GGF principles without executive authority.
  - **Selection:** Chosen via a two-stage process: (1) open nomination accessible to all contributors, followed by (2) a community vote requiring a two-thirds majority, ensuring democratic legitimacy. Candidates are evaluated based on demonstrated wisdom (e.g., conflict resolution experience, cross-cultural understanding) and alignment with GGF principles (e.g., commitment to LMCI).
  - **Terms:** Staggered three-year terms.

---

## 3. Operational Protocols

These protocols create conditions for flow states through clear objectives, minimal interruptions, and blameless collaboration.

### 3.1 Code & Content Protocol
- **Repository:** Work stored in public Git repositories (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- **Licensing:** Code uses MIT or Apache 2.0; content uses CC-BY-SA.
- **Versioning:** Semantic versioning (e.g., v2.2.0).
- **Collective Ownership:** Ideas are collective property, detaching from ego.
- **Accessibility:** Documentation adheres to Grade 8 readability and multilingual translation (see Section 3.11).
- **Intellectual Property Guidance:** For complex scenarios (e.g., AI-generated content, collaborative innovations, commercial applications), the Support Guild provides clear protocols to ensure fair attribution, open-source compliance, and dispute resolution.

### 3.2 Communication Protocol
- **Asynchronous-First:** Text-based, asynchronous communication via Mattermost or Matrix.
- **Synchronous Gatherings:** Optional video calls and in-person retreats in nature for strategic alignment and recharging.
- **Public Outreach:** Work shared via accessible media (e.g., YouTube, podcasts, interactive models) in multiple languages.
- **Right to Unplug:** Contributors may disconnect to prevent burnout.
- **Digital Minimalism Ethos:** To support deep work, prevent burnout, and foster genuine connection, the GGF promotes a cultural ethos of digital minimalism. This is a recommendation, not a mandate. It encourages practices such as intentionally limiting notifications, preferring focused tools over distracting platforms, and valuing the quality and thoughtfulness of communication over its speed and volume. This practice directly supports our `Right to Unplug` and `LMCI` compass.
- **Contemplative Practices:** Labs may adopt optional rituals to enhance focus, cohesion, and creative insight, such as:
  - 5-minute silent syncs before meetings to foster presence and collective mindfulness.
  - Intention-setting practices to align contributors on shared goals, fostering clarity and purpose.
  - Dream journaling to capture subconscious insights, encouraging innovative thinking.
  - Contemplative governance, including 2-3 minutes of shared silence before high-stakes meetings to promote centered deliberation and reduce reactive decision-making.
- **Feedback Loops:** Quarterly Lab feedback to Stewards Circle via forums or reports.

### 3.3 Financial Protocol
- **Funding:** Secured through grants, donations, Reform Impact Bonds (innovative financial instruments tied to social and environmental outcomes), and other diversified sources such as crowdfunding, partnerships, and potential governance-as-a-service offerings.
- **Treasury:** Held in a transparent treasury (e.g., OpenCollective).
- **Allocation:** Stewards Circle allocates budgets via consent-based participatory proposals, prioritizing Core Labs. Quadratic voting is used for participatory budgeting.
- **Forking Assets:** Assets split equitably via Fork Mediation Guild, defaulting to 50/50 for shared projects.
- **Financial Strategy & Resilience:**
  - **Diversification:** Support Guild explores diverse funding, including consulting services, training programs, and governance-as-a-service models.
  - **Metrics:** Public dashboard tracks funding runway, income diversity, expenditure, and environmental impact of financial decisions.
  - **Crisis Management:** In funding shortfalls, participatory de-budgeting prioritizes Core Labs, with contingency plans for 6-month runway minimum.
- **Conflict of Interest Protocol:** Contributors disclose potential conflicts (e.g., financial interests, partnerships) during budget allocation or partnership decisions. The Stewards Circle reviews disclosures, and affected contributors recuse themselves from relevant votes.

### 3.4 Decision-Making Protocol
- **Tools:** Loomio facilitates proposals and voting.
- **Process:** Proposals move from idea to discussion, vote, and implementation, inspired by sociocracy. Complex issues use a dialectical process:
  - **Articulation:** Opposing viewpoints documented clearly.
  - **Synthesis:** Facilitators propose a “third way” within 7 days.
  - **Timeline:** Decisions conclude within 14 days unless extended by consent.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Uses “Spiral Peacecraft” with blameless post-mortems. Mediators intervene early. Escalation to Stewards Circle if unresolved after 30 days.
- **Restorative Justice Protocol:** For high-stakes disputes, optional healing circles rebuild trust, facilitated by trained mediators.
- **Contemplative Governance:** High-stakes meetings begin with 2-3 minutes of silence.
- **Reversibility:** Significant decisions include 6-month review periods and rollback plans.
- **Success Metrics Dashboard:** Decisions are evaluated against organizational health metrics (e.g., LMCI impact, operational efficiency, contributor engagement) via a public dashboard updated quarterly.

### 3.5 Tool Selection Protocol
- **Selection Process:**
  1. Seek robust FOSS tools as default.
  2. Evaluate proprietary tools for privacy, autonomy, and exit strategy.
  3. Document proprietary tool decisions in Tools & Tech Stack, including cost-benefit analysis and environmental impact (e.g., carbon footprint).
- **Deprecation Timeline:** Proprietary tools have 1-3 year deprecation plans.
- **Resilience:** Tools support self-hosting, regular data backups, and detailed disaster recovery plans (e.g., restoration timelines, data integrity checks).
- **Environmental Impact:** Tool choices assessed for energy consumption and ecological footprint, prioritizing low-impact solutions.

### 3.6 Work Cycle Protocol
- **Sprint-Based Objectives:** 2-4 week cycles with clear goals.
- **Blameless Post-Mortems:** Reviews focus on systemic learning.
- **Protocol Effectiveness Metrics:** Each cycle includes a review of protocol effectiveness (e.g., time to decision, contributor satisfaction), reported to the Stewards Circle.

### 3.7 Fractal Scaling Protocol
- **Lab Size Limits:** Split Labs based on complexity or contributor count (e.g., 20+).
- **Decentralized Onboarding:** Labs use standardized templates (see Section 8).

- **Decommissioning:** If unviable after 6 months, Labs may merge or dissolve via consent, ensuring knowledge transfer.
- **Metrics:** Labs define 2-3 success indicators during formation, aligned with LMCI.

### 3.14 Environmental Impact Assessment Protocol
- **Scope:** All major decisions (e.g., funding, partnerships, tool selection, retreats) undergo environmental impact assessments to minimize carbon footprints and promote climate justice.
- **Process:** Labs submit impact estimates, reviewed by the Support Guild, with public reporting via the financial dashboard.
- **Metrics:** Include carbon emissions, resource consumption, and ecological restoration contributions.
- **Accountability:** Decisions with high environmental impact require mitigation plans or offsets, such as:
  - Using renewable energy providers for digital infrastructure.
  - Partnering with verified carbon offset programs (e.g., reforestation projects).
  - Reducing physical travel through virtual collaboration tools.
  - Investing in local ecological restoration initiatives tied to Lab activities.

### 3.15 Conflict of Interest Protocol
- **Disclosure:** Contributors disclose financial, personal, or professional interests that may influence decisions (e.g., funding allocations, partnerships).
- **Review:** Stewards Circle evaluates disclosures, ensuring transparency via public logs.
- **Recusal:** Affected contributors recuse themselves from relevant decisions to maintain integrity.
- **Audits:** Annual reviews ensure compliance, with mediation for disputes.

### 3.16 Implementation Prioritization Protocol
- **Purpose:** Guides organizations adopting GGF-OS by prioritizing protocol implementation based on scale, resources, and context.
- **Process:** Labs assess needs and select initial protocols (e.g., Communication, Decision-Making, Lab Health Review) using a prioritization matrix (e.g., impact vs. complexity).
- **Support:** Stewards Circle provides templates and case studies to streamline adoption.
- **Feedback:** Adopters report outcomes to refine the matrix, stored in a public case study database.
- **Lite Version Development:** A simplified “GGF-OS Lite” version is planned for smaller organizations, focusing on core protocols (e.g., Communication, Decision-Making, Financial Transparency) to reduce complexity.

### 3.17 Internal Regenerative Economy Protocol
To ensure integrity and operationalize our own principles, the GGF will serve as the first pilot site for the novel financial and economic models it develops. This protocol creates a direct feedback loop, allowing us to test, refine, and demonstrate the viability of our frameworks through our own lived experience.

- **Phase 1: Internal Love Ledger & `Leaves` (Reputational)**
  - The GGF will implement an internal `Love Ledger` for all contributors to log non-monetary contributions such as peer-mentorship, conflict mediation, care work, and knowledge sharing.
  - These validated contributions will generate `Leaves`, a symbolic and reputational sub-unit of the `Hearts` currency, acknowledging value creation within the community.

- **Phase 2: `Hearts` for Governance (Functional)**
  - As the system matures, `Leaves` will become convertible to internal `Hearts` tokens.
  - These non-monetary `Hearts` will be integrated into our governance processes. Use cases include staking `Hearts` as an escalation bond in conflict resolution or using them to amplify voting power in the quadratic voting for participatory budgeting, thereby giving more weight to those who have contributed more care and value to the ecosystem.

- **Phase 3: `Hearts` for Stewardship & AUBI Prototyping (Economic)**
  - The `Stewardship Compensation` (Tier 3 Support) will be denominated and paid in `Hearts`, creating a closed-loop internal economy.
  - This system will serve as a prototype for the Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) framework. Core Stewards will receive a baseline of `Hearts` (Layer 1 AUBI), augmented by adaptive bonuses (Layer 2 AUBI) generated from their `Love Ledger` contributions, demonstrating a real-world model of our most advanced economic theories.

## 4. Membership & Contribution

### 4.1 Principle of Sovereign Identity
Participation is based on contribution and reputation, not state-registered legal identities. To balance safety, accountability, and trust, we recognize the following identity protocols:

- **Choice of Identity:** Contributors are free to participate using either their legal name or a stable, consistent pseudonym. Both are considered equally valid forms of identity within the GGF ecosystem. The community culture values the quality of contribution above the type of identity chosen.

- **Reputation as the Core:** Regardless of whether a real name or pseudonym is used, trust is built through consistent, good-faith participation, peer review, and verifiable contributions. This reputation, tied to a stable identifier (name or pseudonym), is the primary currency of trust and influence within the GGF.

- **The Limited Role of Anonymity:** General collaboration, discussion, and decision-making require a stable identifier to build trust and accountability. Therefore, anonymous participation in these forums is not permitted. However, specific, protocol-defined channels will exist for anonymous feedback (e.g., submissions to the `Office of the Adversary`, optional sections of exit interviews) to ensure candid input can be received safely.

- **Minimalist Legal Interface:** For necessary legal or financial transactions, the `Support Guild` will interface with legal identities, but this information will be firewalled to protect the privacy of the contributor's chosen community identity.

- **Accessibility:** Onboarding accommodates diverse needs (see Section 3.11).

### 4.2 Contributor Journeys & Reciprocal Support
Engagement in the GGF follows flexible, non-hierarchical pathways. To honor diverse forms of contribution and ensure the GGF's long-term sustainability, we recognize a three-tiered support model grounded in the principle of reciprocal gifting.

- **Tier 1: Volunteer Gifting (The Foundation):** The majority of contributions are gifts of time, energy, and wisdom to the commons. This reflects the open-source and mutual aid ethos at the heart of the GGF.

- **Tier 2: Growth Support (Capacity Building):** The GGF gifts back to its contributors by fostering their development. Contributors may receive stipends for education, conference travel, or aligned personal projects that build their capacity and, in turn, enrich the GGF ecosystem.

- **Tier 3: Stewardship Compensation (Sustainability):** To ensure the GGF can be sustained by dedicated stewards regardless of their financial circumstances, a limited number of mission-critical, high-commitment roles (e.g., within the Support Guild or Core Labs) may be eligible for a modest stipend. These arrangements are proposed by a Lab, approved with consent by the Stewards Circle, and are transparently logged. This is not a salary, but a mechanism to prevent financial barriers to deep stewardship.

**Additional Support & Pathways:**
- **Engagement Journeys:** Contributors may naturally follow different paths of engagement, such as Observer, Contributor, Steward, or Guardian, which are descriptive of their involvement, not formal, hierarchical titles.
- **Burnout Prevention:** Lab Stewards are responsible for monitoring for signs of burnout and encouraging collective breaks and adherence to the `Right to Unplug`.
- **Exit Interviews:** Departing contributors are invited to participate in a compassionate exit interview to share feedback, ensuring the GGF continues to learn and improve.
