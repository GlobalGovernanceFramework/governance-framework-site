# GGF Operating System (GGF-OS v1.5)

This document is the constitution, manifesto, and operational guide for the Global Governance Framework (GGF). It is a public, living document, hosted on a Git repository, and subject to participatory revision processes. The GGF-OS embodies the principles it promotes, acting as a prototype for resilient, participatory governance designed to foster collective flow and minimize egoic friction.

## 0. Preamble: The Call & The Commitment

### The Polycrisis Imperative
Humanity faces interconnected global crises—climate change, inequality, conflict, and technological disruption—that demand coordinated, systemic responses. These challenges threaten the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants, requiring adaptive, inclusive governance grounded in shared stewardship.

### Our Response: A Guild of Stewards
The GGF exists to co-create, curate, and disseminate open-source governance frameworks for planetary well-being. We are a global network of contributors collaboratively designing systems that foster resilience, equity, and sustainability.

### Our Compass: Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI)
GGF’s success is measured by the flourishing of its members and the communities it serves, assessed through a holistic index: Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI).

### Our Foundation: Integrated & Evolving Consciousness
Our work integrates healthy expressions of all levels of human consciousness, inspired by Spiral Dynamics:
- **Beige:** Ensuring physical security and survival needs.
- **Purple:** Fostering community belonging and cultural cohesion.
- **Red:** Encouraging bold action and individual agency.
- **Blue:** Upholding shared values and disciplined execution.
- **Orange:** Driving innovation and strategic effectiveness.
- **Green:** Promoting inclusivity and empathy.
- **Yellow/Turquoise:** Embracing systemic, holistic integration.
- **Coral:** Actively creating space for paradigm-breaking innovation, fostering unforeseen models of governance and collaboration that may challenge this framework itself. This ethos ensures GGF remains a catalyst for continuous evolution, avoiding dogmatism.

## 1. Core Principles

These principles guide GGF’s internal operations, designed to enable collective flow and reduce egoic attachment.

### Radical Transparency
All non-private operational data—finances, decision logs, and project roadmaps—are publicly accessible via platforms like OpenCollective.

### Subsidiarity & Polycentrism
GGF is a modular network of autonomous Working Groups (Labs). Decision-making is localized to Labs for their domains, with a Stewards Circle coordinating essential network-wide functions.

### Direct & Deliberative Participation
All members have a voice. Decision-making uses a tiered model:
- **Consensus** for charter amendments.
- **Consent** for operational decisions.
- **Individual autonomy** for personal tasks.
Digital tools like Loomio and Pol.is enable scalable deliberation.

### Epistemic Humility & Open Inquiry
We foster curiosity over certainty. An internal “Office of the Adversary” challenges assumptions, and all work is versioned (e.g., v1.5) to encourage iteration.

### Ethical Tooling
We prioritize tools that are free, open-source, privacy-respecting, and decentralized, while allowing pragmatic use of proprietary tools when necessary, guided by a clear selection protocol (see Section 3.5).

### Graceful Obsolescence
GGF is a scaffold, not a monument. A “Sunset Protocol” defines conditions for dissolving or transitioning the organization when its mission is fulfilled.

---

## 2. Organizational Structure

GGF operates as a holarchy—a system of nested, autonomous units—designed to minimize egoic attachment through fluid roles and collective ownership.

### A. Working Groups (Labs)
- **Purpose:** Core operational units aligned with GGF domains, organized as Core Labs or Emergent Labs (see Section 7).
- **Autonomy:** Labs manage their projects, budgets, and teams, adhering to the GGF-OS.
- **Operation:** Each Lab defines its internal processes but aligns with the Charter’s principles.

### B. Roles
- **Contributors:** Individuals contributing code, content, facilitation, or resources, recognized for their work rather than fixed titles.
- **Lab Stewards:** One or two rotating coordinators per Lab, responsible for communication, Charter adherence, and project oversight. Contributors *take on* this role temporarily, not as a permanent identity.
- **Stewards Circle:** A small, rotating body of one steward per Lab, tasked with:
  1. Resource allocation.
  2. Cross-Lab coordination.
  3. Charter guardianship.
  4. External communications.
- **Support Guild:** A specialized Lab providing tools, infrastructure, and administrative support (e.g., legal, financial) to all Labs.
- **Founding Guardian:** The initial custodian of GGF’s principles, with a defined transition protocol (see Section 5).

## 3. Operational Protocols

These protocols create conditions for flow states through clear objectives, minimal interruptions, and blameless collaboration.

### 3.1 Code & Content Protocol
- **Repository:** All work is stored in a public Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- **Licensing:** Code uses permissive open-source licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0). Content uses Creative Commons (e.g., CC-BY-SA).
- **Versioning:** Frameworks and documents use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.5.0).
- **Collective Ownership:** Submitted ideas become collective property for development, modification, or discard, detaching them from individual ego.

### 3.2 Communication Protocol
- **Asynchronous-First:** Primary communication is text-based and asynchronous via platforms like Mattermost or Matrix to protect uninterrupted work time and enable flow.
- **Synchronous Gatherings:** Optional video calls for high-bandwidth discussions and in-person retreats in nature for strategic alignment and recharging.
- **Public Outreach:** GGF shares work through accessible media (e.g., YouTube, podcasts, interactive models).
- **Right to Unplug:** Contributors have the explicit right to disconnect and set personal boundaries to prevent burnout and sustain effortless collaboration.

### 3.3 Financial Protocol
- **Funding:** Secured through grants, donations, and mechanisms like Reform Impact Bonds.
- **Treasury:** Funds are held in a transparent treasury (e.g., OpenCollective).
- **Allocation:** The Stewards Circle allocates budgets to Labs based on participatory proposals, prioritizing Core Labs initially (see Section 7).

### 3.4 Decision-Making Protocol
- **Tools:** Platforms like Loomio facilitate proposals and voting.
- **Process:** Proposals move from idea to discussion, vote, and implementation, inspired by sociocratic models. For complex issues, a dialectical process requires articulating opposing viewpoints and synthesizing a “third way” to transcend binaries.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Uses the “Spiral Peacecraft” model, with blameless post-mortems focusing on systemic causes rather than personal fault.
- **Contemplative Governance:** High-stakes meetings begin with 2-3 minutes of shared silence to foster centered, receptive deliberation.

### 3.5 Tool Selection Protocol
To operationalize the Ethical Tooling principle, GGF adopts a “FOSS-first, not FOSS-only” approach, prioritizing free, open-source tools aligned with our values while allowing pragmatic use of proprietary tools when necessary.

- **Selection Process:**
  1. **Viable FOSS Alternative:** Seek a robust, well-maintained FOSS tool that meets the task’s needs as the strong default.
  2. **Values-Alignment Check:** If no viable FOSS alternative exists, evaluate proprietary tools against:
     - Respect for user privacy and data sovereignty.
     - Avoidance of dependencies compromising long-term autonomy.
     - Availability of a clear exit strategy for future migration.
  3. **Transparent Justification:** Decisions to use key proprietary tools must be documented publicly in the Tools & Tech Stack document, with a clear rationale for bypassing FOSS alternatives.

### 3.6 Work Cycle Protocol
- **Sprint-Based Objectives:** Labs operate in 2-4 week cycles with clear, achievable goals, providing immediate feedback to support flow states.
- **Blameless Post-Mortems:** Project reviews focus on systemic learning, not individual blame, reducing egoic attachment to outcomes.

## 4. Membership & Contribution

### 4.1 Principle of Sovereign Identity
Participation is based on contribution and reputation, not state-registered legal identities, reducing bureaucratic control and egoic identity attachment.

- **Pseudonymity as a Right:** Contributors may operate under stable pseudonyms. The community values work quality over legal names.
- **Reputation as Currency:** Trust is built through consistent, good-faith participation, peer review, and verifiable contributions. Reputation is the primary “identity.”
- **Minimalist Legal Interface:** The Support Guild handles legal or financial transactions requiring a legal identity (e.g., grants, contracts), firewalled to protect contributor privacy. All other interactions default to pseudonymity.

---

## 5. Foundational Roles & Transition Protocols

### 5.1 Philosophy of Stewardship
GGF is a resilient, self-evolving ecosystem. All roles, including that of the original creator, are temporary and serve the organization’s principles and mission. Roles are functions, not identities, fostering ego-reduced collaboration.

### 5.2 The Role of the Founding Guardian
The Founding Guardian is the initial custodian of GGF’s core principles, inspired by the “Council of Guardians” model.

- **Mandate:** To uphold the integrity of GGF’s principles without executive authority, acting as a guide and reflective voice.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Pose questions during key decisions to ensure alignment with the GGF-OS (e.g., “Does this align with radical transparency?”).
  - Serve as a “living historian,” providing context on the original intent of principles when requested.
  - Champion mechanisms like the Office of the Adversary to challenge groupthink.
- **Limitations:** The Founding Guardian cannot veto decisions by the Stewards Circle or Labs, allocate resources unilaterally, or direct projects.

### 5.3 Founder Transition Protocol
This protocol ensures the organization’s independence through a phased transition.

- **Phase 1: Catalyst (Years 1-2)**  
  The Founding Guardian plays a high-involvement role in establishing the organization, frameworks, and community, while building structures for decentralization.
- **Phase 2: Stewardship & Mentorship (Years 3-5)**  
  The Founding Guardian mentors other stewards, delegates all executive responsibilities, and reduces operational involvement. At least one extended sabbatical is taken to test organizational resilience.
- **Phase 3: Guardian Emeritus (Year 6+)**  
  The role becomes purely advisory, with no formal responsibilities. The community may consult the Guardian Emeritus, but GGF operates independently. This phase includes a clause for its eventual sunsetting.

## 6. Network Dynamics & Evolution

### 6.1 Forkability Protocol (The Right to Evolve)
GGF operates as a dynamic, voluntary network. Any Working Group or Lab retains the sovereign right to “fork”—to peacefully secede and establish itself as an independent entity, taking its projects and identity with it. This transcends success/failure binaries, fostering a generative ecosystem.

- **Process:**
  1. **Declaration of Intent:** The Lab declares its intent to fork, outlining reasons and vision.
  2. **Dialogue Period (30-60 days):** A good-faith dialogue occurs between the Lab and Stewards Circle to explore alternatives and ensure informed decisions.
  3. **Peaceful Separation:** If forking proceeds:
     - **Intellectual Property:** The forking group retains ownership of its created IP. Foundational GGF IP remains under its original open-source license, with encouragement for the new entity to license improvements back to the GGF commons.
     - **Shared Assets:** Financial assets are negotiated transparently and equitably.
     - **Continued Relationship:** Forking is not hostile; the new entity is invited to remain a peer in the broader ecosystem.

## 7. The Lab Ecosystem

### 7.1 A Dynamic & Dual Structure
GGF’s work is organized through a dual structure of Labs to balance strategic focus with emergent innovation. All Labs operate with full autonomy per the principle of Subsidiarity.

### 7.2 Core Labs
- **Purpose:** To ensure sustained effort on “Keystone Reforms” and “Critical Path” areas identified in the Treaty for Our Only Home, addressing foundational aspects of the polycrisis.
- **Initial List:** Derived from Tier 1 priorities (e.g., Climate & Energy Governance Lab, Peace & Conflict Resolution Lab, Food Systems Lab).
- **Function:** Primary recipients of initial funding and resources to maintain focus on GGF’s core mission.

### 7.3 Emergent Labs
- **Purpose:** To enable contributors to propose new areas of focus, fostering novelty, inclusivity, and adaptation to unforeseen challenges.
- **Formation:** Proposed by any group of 3-5 contributors with a clear purpose statement and commitment to the GGF-OS.
- **Chartering:** Proposals are submitted to the Stewards Circle for lightweight ratification to ensure alignment with core principles.
- **Evolution:** Successful Emergent Labs may transition to Core Lab status, allowing GGF’s strategic focus to evolve.
