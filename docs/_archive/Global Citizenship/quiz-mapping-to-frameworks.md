# Quiz-to-Framework Mapping Strategy
*Current implementation for the Interactive Global Citizenship Compass*

## 🎯 Quiz Structure & Strategic Goals

### **Core Design Principles**
- **Multiple pathways to Tier 0**: Emphasize that the Treaty for Our Only Home is foundational
- **Personal relevance**: Connect user interests to specific frameworks
- **Progressive complexity**: Start with accessible concepts, build toward systems thinking
- **Tier 0 prominence**: Make it clear that governance reform enables all other solutions

├── Importance: CRITICAL
└── Message: "Before we can solve other challenges, we need governance systems that coordinate global action"
```

### **Tier 1: Urgent Action**
```
Climate & Energy Governance
├── Description: "Urgent action on climate change and clean energy transition"
├── Color: #2D5F2D (Forest green)
└── Connection: Environmental crisis → immediate response

Peace & Conflict Resolution  
├── Description: "Building sustainable peace and resolving conflicts"
├── Color: #2B4B8C (Deep blue)
└── Connection: Justice values → institutional peace-building
```

## 🧮 Recommendation Algorithm

### **Current Logic:**
1. **Collect all framework mappings** from user's 3 answers
2. **Count frequency** of each framework mention
3. **Sort by popularity** and select top 3 recommendations
4. **Special weighting**: Treaty for Our Only Home gets prominence when selected

### **Example User Journey:**
```
User Answers:
├── Q1: "Climate & Environment" → [climate-energy]
├── Q2: "Protecting & Healing" → [environmental-stewardship, healthcare]  
└── Q3: "Global & Planetary" → [climate-energy, peace-conflict, treaty-foundation]

Algorithm Results:
├── climate-energy: 2 mentions → Primary recommendation
├── treaty-foundation: 1 mention → Foundation emphasis
└── environmental-stewardship: 1 mention → Supporting framework

Display Order:
1. 🌍 Climate & Energy Governance (Tier 1) - Your primary interest
2. ⭐ Treaty for Our Only Home (Tier 0) - Foundation that enables climate action  
3. 🌱 Environmental Stewardship (Tier 2) - Supporting systems
```

## 🎯 Strategic Tier 0 Pathways

### **Current Routes to Treaty Framework:**
1. **Direct Selection**: "All systems working together" → Immediate Treaty recommendation
2. **Systems Thinking**: "Transforming Systems" → Direct Treaty pathway  
3. **Scale Awareness**: "All levels connected" → Multi-scale governance understanding
4. **Planetary Scope**: "Global & Planetary" → Includes Treaty among recommendations

### **Messaging Strategy:**
- **Foundation First**: Emphasize that other frameworks need governance coordination
- **Visual Prominence**: ⭐ highlighting and special amber styling
- **Clear Value Proposition**: "Before we can solve [specific issue], we need systems that work together"

## 📊 Current Gaps & Enhancement Opportunities

### **Limited Framework Coverage:**
- **Currently mapped**: 8 out of 30+ frameworks
- **Missing tiers**: Limited Tier 3 and Tier 4 representation
- **Missing frameworks**: Most specialized frameworks not yet mapped

### **Simplistic Mapping Logic:**
- **Current**: One-to-one or one-to-few mappings
- **Potential**: More nuanced interest profiling
- **Enhancement**: Cross-tier connections and prerequisite relationships

### **Quiz Scope:**
- **Current**: 3 questions, basic interest identification
- **Potential**: Values assessment, complexity preference, cultural context
- **Enhancement**: Learning style and engagement preference mapping

## 🚀 Recommended Enhancements

### **Short-term (Next Iteration):**
1. **Expand framework database** to include all 30+ frameworks
2. **Add Tier 3 & 4 quiz pathways** for culture/consciousness-oriented users
3. **Refine Treaty messaging** with specific examples of why it's foundational
4. **Add framework prerequisites** (e.g., "Technology Governance builds on Treaty foundation")

### **Medium-term (Future Versions):**
1. **Multi-dimensional profiling** (values + complexity + engagement style)
2. **Dynamic quiz length** based on user engagement level
3. **Cultural adaptation** of questions and framework emphasis
4. **Learning pathway suggestions** (recommended progression through tiers)

### **Advanced Features:**
1. **AI-powered recommendations** based on global events and user behavior
2. **Community matching** (connect users with similar framework interests)  
3. **Local implementation focus** (frameworks relevant to user's geographic region)
4. **Personalized practice suggestions** based on framework interests and development level
