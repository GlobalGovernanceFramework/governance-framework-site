# Official Policy on Political and Partisan Engagement

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-06-25

## 1. Preamble & Purpose

The mission of the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF) initiative is to provide a pragmatic and comprehensive framework for upgrading global systems to meet 21st-century challenges. Our work is inherently **political** in that it deals with governance, public affairs, and the structure of power. However, to maintain our integrity, credibility, and ability to engage with all stakeholders, we must remain rigorously **non-partisan**.

This policy outlines the principles that guide our interaction with political entities, parties, and ideologies. Its purpose is to protect our mission from partisan co-option and to ensure our focus remains squarely on the systemic reforms outlined in our frameworks.

## 2. Core Stance: Principled Non-Partisanship

The GGF's allegiance is not to any nation, political party, or ideology, but to the **Core Principles** outlined in the *Treaty for Our Only Home*. These principles—including Democratic Legitimacy, Ecological Integrity, and Universal Accountability—are our sole benchmark for evaluating policies and engaging in public discourse.

We will analyze and comment on policies and events through the lens of our principles, but we will not adopt partisan framing or language.

## 3. What We Do Not Do (Prohibitions)

To protect our non-partisan status, all individuals officially representing the GGF are prohibited from:

* **Endorsing Political Parties or Candidates:** We do not, under any circumstances, endorse or oppose any political party, candidate for public office, or political ideology.
* **Donating Organizational Funds:** GGF funds will not be contributed to any political campaign, party, or political action committee.
* **Adopting Partisan Language:** We will not use partisan slogans, talking points, or labels to describe our work or the work of others.
* **Taking Positions on Unrelated Domestic Issues:** We will limit our commentary to issues directly relevant to the principles and mechanisms of global governance. We will not take a stance on purely domestic political matters that fall outside the scope of our framework.

## 4. How We Engage (Permitted Engagement)

Our goal is to be an influential and trusted resource for all actors seeking to build a more resilient future. Therefore, we will:

* **Engage with All Stakeholders:** We will seek dialogue with policymakers, government officials, civil society leaders, and academics from across the political spectrum to explain our research and framework.
* **Focus on Policies and Systems:** Our commentary will always focus on the merits or flaws of specific policies, institutional designs, and systemic structures, not on the personalities or party affiliations of those involved.
* **Ground All Commentary in Our Core Principles:** Every public statement, analysis, or critique must be explicitly linked back to one or more of our foundational principles. We will always explain *why* a certain policy aligns with or violates the principles of our framework.
* **Maintain a Global Perspective:** We will consistently frame our analysis in the context of its implications for global stability, planetary health, and human flourishing, avoiding a narrow nationalistic viewpoint.

## 5. Defining Our "Red Lines"

While we seek broad engagement, we will actively and publicly oppose actions or policies that constitute a fundamental violation of our Core Principles. These "red lines" include, but are not limited to, efforts to:

* Systematically dismantle democratic institutions or suppress democratic participation.
* Abolish or violate fundamental, universal human rights.
* Promote aggressive nationalism or military conflict over cooperative solutions.
* Willfully accelerate ecological destruction in contravention of established planetary boundaries.

Our opposition will be voiced in a principled, evidence-based manner, consistent with this policy.
