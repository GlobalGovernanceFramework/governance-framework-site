## 13. Economic Foundations for Global Citizenship

### AUBI: Creating the Conditions for Global Citizenship

Global citizenship requires certain foundational conditions to flourish. Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) represents a transformative approach that can enable fuller participation in global citizenship by:

- **Providing Economic Security**: By ensuring basic needs are met, AUBI frees individuals to engage with broader concerns beyond immediate survival
- **Recognizing Diverse Contributions**: AUBI's value recognition component acknowledges non-market activities essential to global citizenship
- **Enabling Cross-Border Mobility**: With baseline economic security, individuals can more easily engage in transnational experiences
- **Supporting Transition Periods**: AUBI provides stability during periods of adaptation to global changes

#### The Three Pillars of AUBI Supporting Global Citizenship

1. **Universality**: Creates a foundation of inclusion that mirrors global citizenship's expansive identity
2. **Adaptability**: Recognizes contextual differences while maintaining common principles, similar to how global citizenship values manifest differently across cultures
3. **Societal Value Recognition**: Acknowledges contributions to collective wellbeing, regardless of whether they generate market value

#### Case Study: AUBI Pilot and Global Citizenship
In Maricá, Brazil, a partial implementation of universal basic income principles has shown promising results in enabling global citizenship practices. Recipients report increased capacity for community engagement, environmental initiatives, and cross-cultural exchanges. The program's adaptation to local needs while maintaining universal principles demonstrates how economic security can serve as a platform for global citizenship.

## 18. Expanding the Circle: Beyond Human-Centered Citizenship

Global citizenship continues to evolve toward greater inclusivity. An emerging frontier involves expanding our circle of consideration beyond humans to include other forms of life and intelligence.

### Theoretical Foundations
- **Expanding Moral Circle**: The historical pattern of extending moral consideration to previously excluded groups
- **Biocentric and Ecocentric Ethics**: Philosophical frameworks that locate intrinsic value in all living beings or entire ecosystems
- **Sentientism**: The view that moral consideration should extend to all beings capable of experiencing suffering
- **Intergenerational Ethics**: Consideration of rights and interests of future generations
- **Non-Anthropocentric Perspectives**: Indigenous and Eastern philosophical traditions that have long recognized the moral standing of non-human entities

As global citizens progress in their journey, many begin to expand their circle of consideration beyond humans:

- **Level 3 (Empathy)**: Developing empathy for non-human beings and systems affected by human actions
- **Level 4 (Participation)**: Including consideration of non-human impacts in decision-making and lifestyle choices
- **Level 5 (Leadership)**: Creating systems and approaches that integrate human and non-human wellbeing


### Spectrum of Approaches
Different global citizens may adopt varying positions along this spectrum:

1. **Human-Centered with Consideration**: Prioritizing human interests while acknowledging responsibilities toward other beings
2. **Guardian/Stewardship Model**: Humans as representatives and protectors of non-human interests
3. **Rights-Based Recognition**: Formal acknowledgment of legal rights for specific non-human entities
4. **Full Moral Community**: Recognition of diverse beings as fellow members of an extended moral community

### Categories of Non-Human Inclusion

#### Animals

- **Democratic Experiments**: Testing methods for including non-human representation in governance
- **Conflict Resolution**: Frameworks for addressing tensions between human and non-human interests

### Navigating Challenges and Disagreements

This expanded understanding of global citizenship raises complex questions:

- **Competing Interests**: How to balance needs of different beings when they conflict
- **Representation Legitimacy**: Who can legitimately speak for non-human entities
- **Practical Boundaries**: Which entities should be included and on what basis
- **Cultural Differences**: Respecting diverse cultural approaches to human/non-human relations

Global citizens may reasonably disagree on these questions while still affirming the principle of expanding moral consideration beyond traditional boundaries. The framework encourages thoughtful engagement with these questions rather than prescribing universal answers.
