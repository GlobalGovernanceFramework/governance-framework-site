An implementation roadmap to help ensure the website promises align with our actual development plans.

Here's a structured approach we could take:

## Framework Development Roadmap

### 1. Core Documentation Completion
- **Finish Essential Documentation Pages**
  - Complete any missing content for Principles, Implementation, Case Studies, and Resources
  - Ensure all pages have consistent depth and quality
  - Add visuals and diagrams where helpful
  
- **Create a Documentation Style Guide**
  - Establish consistent formatting, terminology, and structure
  - Define document templates for different content types
  - Ensure multilingual support is complete

### 2. Interactive Elements
- **Self-Assessment Tools**
  - Create a governance interoperability assessment tool
  - Develop a decision allocation calculator to help determine appropriate governance levels
  - Build interactive case studies that users can explore

- **Framework Visualization Tools**
  - Interactive diagrams showing relationships between governance levels
  - Visual representation of the twelve constitutional principles
  - Decision flow charts for implementation guidance

### 3. Community Building
- **Contribution Mechanisms**
  - Establish clear protocols for how others can contribute to the framework
  - Create a submission process for case studies and implementation examples
  - Set up forums or discussion spaces for governance practitioners

- **Regular Update Schedule**
  - Commit to regular content additions (monthly/quarterly)
  - Plan for case study expansions based on real-world applications
  - Schedule reviews and updates based on feedback

### 4. Implementation Support
- **Downloadable Resources**
  - Templates for governance assessments
  - Workshop materials for implementation
  - Checklists and guidebooks for practitioners

- **Consulting Framework**
  - Define how you might support organizations wanting to implement the framework
  - Create clear contact pathways for implementation assistance
  - Develop standard engagement models if applicable

### Timeline Suggestion
- **Q1 2025**: Complete core documentation
- **Q2 2025**: Develop initial interactive tools
- **Q3 2025**: Launch community contribution mechanisms
- **Q4 2025**: Expand implementation support resources

By planning these additions with clear timelines, we'll ensure that what's promised on the website aligns with actual development plans. This also gives us a roadmap to share with potential collaborators and users to set appropriate expectations.
