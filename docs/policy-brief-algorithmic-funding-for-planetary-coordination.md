# **Policy Brief: Algorithmic Funding for Planetary Coordination**
*Securing Sustainable Financing for Meta-Governance Infrastructure*

## **Executive Summary**
Meta-governance—the coordination of governance systems across domains—is a **global public good** that lacks sustainable funding. We propose allocating **a fractional share (0.1%-1%) of high-frequency trading (HFT) and algorithmic transaction revenues** to fund critical meta-governance functions, including:
- Cross-domain crisis response
- Interoperability tool development
- Equity safeguards for marginalized participants

This is ethically justified as a **"coordination infrastructure tax"** on systems that benefit from global stability but currently externalize systemic risks.

---

## **The Challenge**
### **Why Current Funding Fails**
1. **Voluntary contributions** are unreliable and favor powerful actors.
2. **Domain-specific budgets** cannot address cross-system challenges.
3. **Short-term political cycles** neglect transgenerational needs.

### **Why Financial Markets Should Contribute**
- HFT and algorithmic trading **depend on global stability** (e.g., predictable regulations, conflict-free supply chains).
- They **externalize systemic risks** (e.g., flash crashes, climate-driven market failures).
- They generate **excess liquidity** (global HFT revenues: ~$15B/year)—a tiny fraction could fund coordination infrastructure.

---

## **The Proposal**
### **Mechanism Design**
1. **Revenue Source**:
 - 0.1%-1% levy on:
 - HFT profits
 - Algorithmic transaction fees (e.g., crypto trades, derivatives)
 - Sovereign wealth fund algorithmic gains

2. **Distribution**:
 - **50% to Core Functions**:
 - Reflexivity engines (AI-human scenario modeling)
 - Semantic interoperability tools
 - Power-balancing audits
 - **30% to Equity Participation**:
 - Grants for under-resourced domains (Indigenous groups, Global South NGOs)
 - "Meta-Governance Translator" training
 - **20% to Transgenerational Lockbox**:
 - Endowment for long-term coordination (e.g., rights of future generations)

3. **Governance**:
 - **Independent Allocation Council** with:
 - Domain representatives (finance, ethics, civil society)
 - Algorithmic transparency mandates
 - Sunset clauses to prevent mission drift

---

## **Ethical & Economic Justification**
### **Moral Case**
- **Beneficiary Pays**: Actors profiting from global systems should fund their maintenance.
- **Harm Reduction**: A tiny levy is cheaper than uncoordinated crises (e.g., pandemics, climate collapse).

### **Economic Case**
- **ROI**: Every $1 invested in meta-governance could save $5+ in crisis-response costs (OECD estimates).
- **Market Stability**: Better coordination reduces black-swan risks (e.g., supply chain failures).

---

## **Implementation Pathway**
### **Phase 1: Pilot Voluntary Pledge**
- Recruit "first mover" financial actors (e.g., Nordic pension funds, ethical algo-trading firms) to contribute 0.1%.
- Fund initial interoperability tools and public dashboards.

### **Phase 2: Sector-Wide Adoption**
- Financial hubs (EU, Singapore) adopt **lightweight regulations** for voluntary participation.
- Demonstrate impact via:
- **Conflict resolution metrics** (e.g., reduced policy clashes)
- **Coordination speed** (e.g., faster crisis response)

### **Phase 3: Institutionalization**
- **BIS/IMF oversight** for global coordination funds.
- **Algorithmic transparency** to build trust (e.g., blockchain-ledger audits).

## **Key Benefits**
| Stakeholder | Benefit |
|-------------|---------|
| **Financial Sector** | Reduced systemic risks; enhanced legitimacy |
| **Governments** | Lower crisis costs; improved policy coherence |
| **Civil Society** | Empowered participation; equity safeguards |
| **Future Generations** | Protected long-term interests |

---

## **Call to Action**
We urge:
1. **Financial regulators** to explore voluntary pilot frameworks.
2. **Philanthropies** to match early contributions (1:1 challenge grants).
3. **Meta-governance participants** to prioritize funding transparency.

**Next Steps**:
- Draft model legislation for Phase 1 voluntary pledges
- Convene financial ethics working group
- Develop impact-tracking dashboard

### **Design Notes for Persuasion**
1. **Leverage "Coordination Dividend" framing**—emphasize efficiency gains over moralizing.
2. **Anchor to existing precedents** (e.g., EU financial transaction tax).
3. **Highlight win-wins** (e.g., market stability + equity).
