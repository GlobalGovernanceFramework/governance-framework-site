Based on the detailed README files for both projects and my understanding of the "Spiral Peacecraft" guide, here is a detailed analysis and recommendation.

### Executive Summary

**My primary recommendation is to feature the "Spiral Peacecraft" guide as a core framework on `globalgovernanceframework.org` while using `spiralize.org` as an educational gateway to introduce the foundational concepts and direct interested users to the full guide.**

This "both/and" strategy leverages the unique strengths of each platform, creating a powerful synergy between education and application.

### Analysis of Each Platform

To make the best recommendation, let's compare the stated purpose of each website with the nature of the "Spiral Peacecraft" guide.

#### 1. Spiralize (`spiralize.org`)

* **Primary Purpose:** To be an "interactive, educational, and engaging web application designed to help users explore and understand the Spiral Dynamics model".
* **Core Features:** Interactive quizzes, personalized insights for growth, learning resources about the stages, and exploring the theory.
* **Audience:** Individuals interested in personal growth, students of Spiral Dynamics, and those new to the model.
* **Tone:** Educational, personal, and exploratory.
* **Fit for the Guide:** While the guide is rooted in Spiral Dynamics, its primary purpose is not just education but *application*. It is a dense, practitioner-focused professional framework. Housing the full, detailed guide on a site geared toward personal quizzes and introductory learning could be a mismatch in audience expectation and depth. However, the "Conscious Governance" section provides a natural point of connection.

#### 2. Global Governance Framework (`globalgovernanceframework.org`)

* **Primary Purpose:** To develop and share "frameworks for governance interoperability and meta-governance structures".
* **Core Vision:** To create "tools, patterns, and frameworks that enable different governance systems to interoperate, share lessons, and evolve together".
* **Audience:** Systems thinkers, policy makers, facilitators, organizational leaders, and those actively building or studying governance models.
* **Tone:** Professional, systemic, and application-oriented.
* **Fit for the Guide:** The alignment here is exceptionally strong. The "Spiral Peacecraft" guide is the very definition of a "tool, pattern, and framework" designed to help different value systems (which are a form of governance) "interoperate, share lessons, and evolve together". The professional and systemic tone of this project is a perfect match for the guide's rigor and practitioner focus.

### Detailed Recommendation: A Synergistic "Both/And" Approach

Instead of choosing one platform over the other, you should strategically use both to create a seamless user journey from learning to application.

#### **Step 1: Position `globalgovernanceframework.org` as the Primary Host**

The full, in-depth "Spiral Peacecraft" guide, with all its toolkits, checklists, and modules, should be published on `globalgovernanceframework.org`.

**Justification:**

* **Perfect Mission Alignment:** The guide is a premier example of the exact kind of framework the GGF project aims to develop and share. It would serve as a powerful flagship content piece, demonstrating the project's vision in action.
* **Right Audience:** The audience visiting GGF will be looking for practical, robust solutions for complex governance and interoperability challenges. They are the ideal audience for the Spiral Peacecraft guide.
* **Establishes Credibility:** Hosting the guide on GGF lends it the professional, serious weight it deserves, positioning it as a key tool for peacebuilding and systemic change rather than just an extension of a personal development model.

#### **Step 2: Position `spiralize.org` as the Educational Gateway**

`spiralize.org` should introduce the foundational concepts of the guide and act as a funnel, directing qualified users to the main framework on GGF.

**Implementation Plan for `spiralize.org`:**

1.  **Create a Dedicated Page:** Within the "Conscious Governance" or "Educational Resources" section of Spiralize, create a new page titled "Practical Application: The Spiral Peacecraft Framework".
2.  **Provide a High-Level Summary:** On this page, offer an engaging summary of what the Spiral Peacecraft guide is. Explain how it applies the Spiral Dynamics model—which users have just learned about on the site—to real-world conflict resolution.
3.  **Showcase Key Concepts:** Briefly touch on concepts like "Value System X-Rays," "Tiered Solutions," and "Spiral Scaffolding Negotiation."
4.  **The Call to Action:** The page's primary goal should be to direct users to the full guide. Use clear, prominent links and buttons like:
    * "Explore the Full Framework on GlobalGovernanceFramework.org"
    * "Download the Practitioner's Toolkit"
    * "Access the In-Depth Guide for Mediators and Leaders"

This strategy allows `spiralize.org` to stay true to its educational mission while providing a clear "next step" for users who want to move from theory to practice. It effectively uses the educational platform to generate an informed and motivated audience for the practical framework hosted on GGF.

Based on the provided framework organization and the deep functionality of the Spiral Peacecraft guide, here is my recommendation for its placement.

### Primary Placement

The most logical and effective primary location for the Spiral Peacecraft guide is within **Tier 1**, directly under the **Peace & Conflict Resolution** category.

  * **Tier 1: Urgent Global Stability & Justice**
      * [Peace & Conflict Resolution](https://www.google.com/search?q=/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace) (In Review)
          * **Spiral Peacecraft: A Guide for Value-Based Conflict Resolution**

**Justification:**

This is the most direct and intuitive fit. The guide's core purpose is to provide a comprehensive, actionable methodology for resolving conflict. Placing it here immediately fulfills the `TODO` note to "*Add missing resources: Guides, tools and templates*." Users visiting your site looking for practical peacebuilding tools will find it exactly where they expect it to be.

### Recommended Cross-Referencing (Crucial for Full Scope)

While its primary home is in Peace & Conflict Resolution, the true power of the Spiral Peacecraft guide is its multi-domain applicability. It is a meta-tool that integrates knowledge and practices from several of your other categories.

Therefore, I strongly recommend **cross-referencing or tagging** the guide in the following sections, with a link pointing back to its primary location. This ensures its full scope is recognized and utilized.

**Cross-reference in Tier 1:**

  * **Indigenous Governance & Traditional Knowledge**: The guide’s emphasis on decolonizing methodologies, adapting to local cultures (e.g., Purple rituals), and co-creating solutions with Indigenous partners makes it a vital tool for this domain.

**Cross-reference in Tier 2:**

  * **Educational Systems**: The guide includes a detailed, multi-level curriculum for training and certifying facilitators. This makes it a relevant framework for advanced educational programs in mediation and leadership.

**Cross-reference in Tier 3:**

  * **Religious & Spiritual Dialogue**: The guide's integration of Tier 3 (Transpersonal) solutions, including contemplative practices and paradigm deconstruction (Coral, Clear), makes it exceptionally well-suited for resolving deep-seated worldview and interfaith conflicts.
  * **Global Ethics & Human Rights**: The framework is built on a strong ethical foundation, explicitly addressing power imbalances, inclusion, and cultural imperialism, which aligns directly with this category.
  * **Cultural Heritage & Linguistic Diversity Preservation**: The methodology advocates for using culturally specific tools like storytelling and co-creating glossaries with local terminology (e.g., using "Ubuntu" for Green), which supports the preservation of intangible cultural heritage.

By giving Spiral Peacecraft a clear primary home and then cross-referencing it across these other relevant domains, you create an architecture that is both intuitive for the user and fully representative of the framework's profound, cross-cutting value.
