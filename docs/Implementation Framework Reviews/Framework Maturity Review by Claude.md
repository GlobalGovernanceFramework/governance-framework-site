Looking at these framework outlines, I'd rank them by readiness for presentation and adoption as follows:

**Most Ready for Adoption:**

1. **Educational Systems Implementation Framework** (Document 6) - This is exceptionally well-developed with:
   - Clear implementation tiers (micro-pilots to national scaling)
   - Detailed budget breakdowns and timelines
   - Comprehensive stakeholder engagement strategies
   - Multiple accessibility provisions and regional adaptations
   - Specific pilot examples and case studies
   - Robust M&E framework with both quantitative and qualitative metrics

2. **Environmental Stewardship Framework** (Document 7) - Highly detailed and actionable:
   - Clear integration with existing frameworks (UNFCCC, SDGs)
   - Specific metrics and intermediate targets
   - Detailed implementation roadmap with phases
   - Comprehensive stakeholder roles and funding mechanisms
   - Strong visual component planning

**Well-Developed but Complex:**

3. **Financial Systems Framework** (Document 8) - Sophisticated but may face adoption challenges:
   - Innovative concepts (*Hearts* currency, Love Ledger) that are well-thought-out
   - Detailed technical architecture and implementation plans
   - May require significant cultural/institutional shifts for adoption

4. **Digital Commons Framework** (Document 3) - Comprehensive governance model:
   - Strong technical implementation details
   - Good accessibility provisions
   - Complex governance structure may slow initial adoption

**Moderately Ready:**

5. **Justice Systems Framework** (Document 11) - Solid foundation:
   - Clear governance structure and implementation timeline
   - Good stakeholder engagement strategy
   - Faces significant political/sovereignty challenges

6. **Climate & Energy Governance** (Document 2) - Well-integrated:
   - Strong alignment with existing frameworks
   - Clear policy mechanisms
   - Political resistance likely in current climate

**Need Further Development:**

The remaining frameworks (Food Systems, Nested Sovereignty, Religious Dialogue, Ethics & Rights, Technology Governance, Disaster Risk Reduction) have good foundations but need more concrete implementation details or face significant political/cultural barriers.

**Recommendation:** The **Educational Systems Framework** appears most ready for immediate presentation and pilot adoption due to its practical approach, clear scaling pathway, and lower political barriers compared to economic or sovereignty-focused frameworks.
