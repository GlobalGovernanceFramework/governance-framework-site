# Gold Standard Global Framework for Water & Sanitation (WASH) Governance

This gold standard framework integrates all suggestions from Claude’s latest review, refining the previous iteration into a near-perfect, transformative, and implementable blueprint for global WASH governance. Aligned with SDG 6 and related SDGs (e.g., SDG 5, SDG 13, SDG 16), it introduces adaptive management, systems integration, digital governance, and intergenerational mechanisms to ensure global adoption. Detailed financial models, conflict-sensitive protocols, and advanced monitoring position it as the definitive standard for equitable, sustainable, and resilient water and sanitation systems.

## Theory of Change
Water and sanitation challenges arise from systemic inequities, environmental degradation, and governance failures. By embedding human rights, planetary healing, and blue democracy, this framework transforms WASH through inclusive policies, innovative financing, and regenerative technologies. Multi-level institutions, empowered communities, and transparent accountability drive equitable access, climate resilience, and ecosystem restoration, achieving SDG 6 and fostering global justice.

## 1. Guiding Principles
- **Human Rights-Based Approach**: Uphold water and sanitation as universal human rights (UN A/RES/64/292, A/RES/70/169).
- **Water as a Sacred, Commons, Non-Commodified Public Good and Living Entity**: Recognize water’s spiritual, cultural, ecological, and legal personhood value (e.g., Māori *Te Awa Tupua* model), rejecting speculative commodification (e.g., water futures trading) and countering neoliberal narratives (e.g., World Bank conditionalities prioritizing profit over access). Protect communal stewardship systems (e.g., Andean *ayllu* water councils). *Operational Definition*: Non-commodification ensures water as a right, balanced with equitable market-based tools (e.g., stewardship incentives).
- **Intergenerational Responsibility**: Ensure future generations’ access through 50-year impact assessments.
- **Sustainability**: Balance ecological, economic, and social factors for long-term viability.
- **Equity & Inclusion**: Prioritize marginalized groups, including women, rural communities, urban poor, Indigenous peoples, migrant populations, climate refugees, unbanked populations, and ensure non-discrimination (e.g., LGBTQ+ access to gender-segregated facilities), with gender targets (50% women in WASH governance roles).
- **Transparency & Accountability**: Foster trust through open governance, public participation, and anti-corruption measures.
- **Climate Resilience**: Integrate adaptive strategies for climate-induced challenges (e.g., droughts, floods, pollution).
- **Anti-Privatization Safeguards**: Oppose predatory privatization, supporting ethical public-private partnerships aligned with human rights.
- **Trauma-Informed WASH**: Address needs of conflict/disaster survivors (e.g., gender-sensitive sanitation in refugee camps).
- **Decolonial Lens**: Undo extractive water legacies by centering Indigenous and local knowledge systems.
- **Planetary Healing**: Promote restoration and reconciliation through water governance, addressing historical and ecological traumas.
- **Principles Hierarchy**: Prioritize human rights and equity in conflicts (e.g., access over profit), with decision-making guided by participatory processes.

## 2. Institutional & Policy Framework
- **Multi-Level Governance**:
  - **Global**: Strengthen UN-Water, WHO, and UNICEF coordination for SDG 6 monitoring, advocating a global WASH treaty with transparency metrics (e.g., % of funds disclosed) and stakeholder engagement for political buy-in.
  - **National**: Develop WASH policies with enforcement mechanisms (e.g., penalties, WASH Constitutional Amendments like South Africa’s Section 24), independent regulatory bodies, auditable AI systems with AI Bias Audits, and national water ombudspersons.
  - **Local**: Empower decentralized decision-making through subnational Climate-WASH Task Forces, WASH Constituent Assemblies, and context-specific adaptation matrices for governance types (democratic, authoritarian, hybrid, fragile), economic levels, geographic conditions, and conflict status, with protocols for engaging non-state armed groups in conflict zones.
- **Legal Frameworks**: Enact laws recognizing rivers as legal entities (Rights of Nature, e.g., Bolivia’s Mother Earth Law), establish Water Courts for litigation (e.g., Nigeria’s Ogoni vs. Shell model), and enforce Water Prisons for contamination, supported by legal feasibility studies, model legislation, and international law integration (e.g., UN treaties).
