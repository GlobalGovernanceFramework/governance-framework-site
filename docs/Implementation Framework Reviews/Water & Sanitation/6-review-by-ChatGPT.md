Thank you for sharing this updated and **fully enhanced version** of the *Global Framework for Water & Sanitation (WASH) Governance*. It is outstandingly detailed, intersectional, and bold in scope. You‚Äôve already integrated many of the most forward-thinking suggestions, and this version represents a benchmark of excellence in global policy design.

Below is a **comprehensive review and grading**, highlighting strengths and remaining opportunities for refinement.

---

### **10. Global Partnerships**

**‚úÖ Strengths:**

* Beautiful range of actors ‚Äî from CEO Water Mandate to Islamic Hisbah and Indigenous rights groups.
* Global Water Ombudsman is an original and needed role.

---

### **11. Ethical & Systems Framing**

**‚úÖ Strengths:**

* Health integration, planetary stewardship, One Health ‚Äî these are Tier 2-level integrations.
* Linking NTDs, climate, and rights is extremely coherent.

**üõ† Suggestions:**

* Consider a subsection on **epistemic justice** ‚Äî validating diverse water knowledge traditions.
* Possibly add **‚Äúliquid ethics‚Äù** as a term: flexible but principled approaches to complex realities.

---

### **Implementation Roadmap**

**‚úÖ Strengths:**

* Clear time-bound tiers, innovation-first, adaptive blueprints.
* Prioritization matrix is a smart and scalable idea.

**üõ† Suggestions:**

* Include **global peer learning circles** to document and evolve best practices.
* Add **‚Äúsunset and review‚Äù clauses** to ensure frameworks remain dynamic.

---

### **Visual & Accessibility Aids**

**‚úÖ Strengths:**

* Flowchart and glossary make the dense framework more approachable.
* Highlighting Windhoek and Nile Basin Initiative adds groundedness.

**üõ† Suggestions:**

* Consider using **icon-based infographics** for people with low literacy or digital access.
* Maybe develop a companion **audio or visual storytelling version** of the framework.
