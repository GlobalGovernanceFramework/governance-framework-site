### **Grading & Review of the Global Governance Framework for Aging Population Support**  
**Overall Score: 92/100 (A)**  
This is a **comprehensive, innovative, and well-structured** outline that integrates economic, social, and ethical dimensions of aging governance. Below, I break down strengths, areas for improvement, and suggestions.

### **Grading by Section**  

#### **1. Economic Security & AUBI (A+)**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Excellent integration of needs-based and contribution-adjusted UBI.  
  - "Lifelong Contribution Ledger" is a standout idea—privacy-respecting and inclusive of unpaid work.  
  - Sustainable funding models (automation/AI taxes) are forward-thinking.  
- **Improvements:**  
  - Clarify how "gradual replacement" of pensions would work (transition risks?).  
  - Add a **global minimum AUBI floor** to prevent disparities between nations.  

#### **2. Right to Meaningful Occupation (A)**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Strong anti-ageism measures and flexible work models.  
  - "Councils of Wisdom Keepers" is a culturally resonant governance innovation.  
- **Improvements:**  
  - Define metrics for "meaningful" (e.g., psychological well-being surveys).  
  - Include **entrepreneurship grants** for older adults to start businesses.  

#### **3. Healthcare & Longevity (A-)**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Holistic focus on prevention, tech, and end-of-life autonomy.  
- **Improvements:**  
  - Explicitly link **longevity research** to AUBI funding (e.g., "healthspan dividends").  
  - Add **telemedicine mandates** for rural/underserved elders.  

#### **4. Social Inclusion & Equity (A)**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - Mixed-age housing and digital inclusion are critical.  
  - "Cultural Transformation" via media/schools is ambitious but necessary.  
- **Improvements:**  
  - Include **intergenerational co-living tax incentives**.  
  - Address **loneliness epidemics** with measurable targets (e.g., reduce isolation by X% in 10 years).  

#### **5. Global Coordination (B+)**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - "Silver Migration Corridors" is pragmatic for labor imbalances.  
  - "Rights of Aging Beings" manifesto aligns with broader human rights.  
- **Improvements:**  
  - Propose a **UN Special Rapporteur on Aging** to enforce standards.  
  - Add **sanctions/rewards** for nations meeting/ignoring framework goals.  

#### **6. Legal & Ethical Safeguards (A-)**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - "Stage-Responsive Policy Design" respects cultural diversity.  
  - "Lifelong Learner’s Passport" is clever.  
- **Improvements:**  
  - Specify **whistleblower protections** for elder abuse reporting.  
  - Link "learning rights" to **AUBI top-ups** (e.g., bonuses for skill acquisition).  

#### **7. Preventive Investment (B+)**  
- **Strengths:**  
  - "Healthy Aging Infrastructure" ties to SDGs.  
- **Improvements:**  
  - Merge with Section 3 (Healthcare) for cohesion.  
  - Add **public-private partnerships** for age-friendly tech R&D.

### **Overall Suggestions for Improvement**  
1. **Implementation Roadmap:**  
   - Add a **timeline** (short/long-term goals) and **tiered adoption** (e.g., pilot cities → nations → global).  
2. **Metrics & Accountability:**  
   - Define KPIs (e.g., elder employment rates, reduction in ageism metrics).  
3. **Crisis Preparedness:**  
   - Address aging in **climate/disaster resilience** plans (e.g., evacuation protocols for mobility-limited elders).  
4. **Private Sector Role:**  
   - Include **corporate tax breaks** for age-friendly workplaces and R&D.  
5. **Language Clarity:**  
   - Replace jargon like "stage-responsive" with plainer terms where possible.

### **Final Thoughts**  
This is a **top-tier framework**—balanced, creative, and actionable. With minor refinements (especially on implementation and accountability), it could serve as a **model for global aging policy**.  

**Revised Score with Improvements:** **95/100 (A+)**  
Keep pushing the intergenerational equity angle—it’s your strongest innovation!
