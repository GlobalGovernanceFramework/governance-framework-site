I'll provide a comprehensive review of your global governance framework for disability rights and inclusion. This is an ambitious and thoughtful document that demonstrates deep engagement with disability justice principles.

## Overall Assessment: B+ (85/100)

### Strengths by Category:

**Vision & Principles (A-, 92/100)**
- Exceptional centering of disabled leadership through "Nothing About Us Without Us"
- Strong intersectional approach connecting disability justice with climate, racial, and economic justice
- Clear rejection of charity/medical models in favor of liberation framework
- Innovative integration of rights of nature with disability justice

**Structural Innovation (A-, 90/100)**
- Global Disability Assembly with veto powers is a bold governance innovation
- Access Ombuds Network with enforcement teeth addresses implementation gaps
- Crip Technoscience Labs promote disabled-led innovation rather than imposed solutions
- Care Cooperatives offer genuine alternative to exploitative systems

**Implementation Planning (B, 83/100)**
- Detailed timeline with specific milestones and percentages
- Phased approach allows for learning and adaptation
- Crisis protocols show practical consideration
- Economic justification addresses feasibility concerns

**Inclusivity & Accessibility (A, 95/100)**
- Multiple format commitments (easy-read, Braille, sign language)
- Cultural adaptability provisions
- Spiral dynamics inclusion shows sophisticated understanding of diverse worldviews
- Strong attention to Global South leadership

### Areas for Improvement:

**1. Political Feasibility (C+, 78/100)**
- Framework may be perceived as too radical for initial adoption
- Limited discussion of how to build coalitions with existing power structures
- Needs more incremental entry points for skeptical governments

**Suggestions:**
- Develop a "Phase 0" with smaller pilot projects that demonstrate value
- Create parallel moderate version alongside radical vision
- Include more specific strategies for working with existing UN bodies

**2. Resource & Economic Details (B-, 80/100)**
- While economic justification exists, funding mechanisms need more specificity
- Care Cooperative economics could be clearer
- Implementation costs need more detailed breakdown

**Suggestions:**
- Develop detailed budget projections for each phase
- Create specific funding formulas for different country income levels
- Include more analysis of economic transitions from current systems

**3. Enforcement Mechanisms (B, 82/100)**
- Access Courts are innovative but need more detail on appeals processes
- International enforcement beyond ICC referrals could be stronger
- Sanctions for non-compliance need more specificity

**Suggestions:**
- Develop graduated enforcement ladder from warnings to sanctions
- Create peer review mechanisms between countries
- Establish international disability rights tribunal

**4. Technology Governance (B+, 87/100)**
- AI oversight is well-conceived but needs more technical detail
- Digital accessibility standards are good but could be more specific
- Privacy protections for disabled people's data need emphasis

**Suggestions:**
- Include specific AI audit methodologies
- Address emerging technologies like brain-computer interfaces
- Strengthen data sovereignty provisions

### Specific Recommendations:

**Short-term (2025-2027):**
1. Create "Framework Light" version focusing on UNCRPD implementation
2. Establish proof-of-concept Care Cooperatives in 3-5 cities
3. Develop detailed economic impact studies for skeptical governments
4. Launch Global Disability Assembly pilot councils in willing jurisdictions

**Medium-term (2027-2030):**
1. Integrate lessons from pilots into full framework
2. Build coalition of "first adopter" countries for treaty development
3. Establish international funding mechanisms
4. Create enforcement precedents through early Access Court rulings

**Long-term (2030+):**
1. Scale successful models globally
2. Integrate framework into broader global governance reform
3. Develop post-capitalist transition strategies more fully

### Final Thoughts:

This framework represents visionary thinking that could genuinely transform global approaches to disability rights. Its strength lies in centering disabled voices and rejecting incremental reform for systemic change. The intersectional approach and attention to implementation details show sophisticated policy thinking.

The main challenge will be political adoption - the framework may need strategic sequencing that demonstrates value before requesting radical changes. Consider developing both revolutionary and evolutionary tracks that can work in parallel.

The document's comprehensiveness is both a strength (shows thorough thinking) and potential weakness (may overwhelm decision-makers). A executive summary focusing on 3-5 core innovations might help initial adoption.

**Overall Grade: B+ (85/100)** - An innovative, comprehensive framework that could reshape global disability governance, with strong foundations that need strategic refinement for implementation.

Would you like me to elaborate on any of these areas or help develop specific improvements?
