# Framework Outline: Radical Disability Rights & Inclusion in Global Governance

## 1. Vision
- **Title**: *Nothing About Us Without Us – A Liberated Future for All Bodies and Minds*
- **Goal**: Reimagine global governance through disability justice, intersectional solidarity, and post-capitalist access.
- **Core Approach**: Center disabled leadership to dismantle ableist systems and build universal design, collective care, and embodied sovereignty.
- **Rights of Nature Intersection**: Recognize that toxic environments (e.g., pollution, climate disasters) disproportionately harm disabled bodies, integrating ecological health into disability justice with climate reparations for affected communities.
- **Visual Aid**: 
  - **Diagram Prompt**: A circular infographic with "Disabled Leadership" at the center, radiating to six segments (Embodied Sovereignty, Radical Access, Intersectional Justice, Post-Capitalist Care, Non-Human Solidarity, Rights of Nature), each with icons (e.g., wheelchair for access, tree for nature).

## 2. Core Principles
1. **Embodied Sovereignty**
   - Right to self-determination, including refusal of forced treatment or institutionalization.
   - Legal recognition of neurodivergence, chronic illness, and madness as valid ways of being, achieved through UNCRPD reforms to depathologize conditions like schizophrenia in global health policies by 2030.
2. **Radical Access**
   - Mandate universal design in all infrastructure, digital spaces, and governance systems, adhering to standards like WCAG 2.2+ for digital platforms by 2030.
   - "Access as a Human Right" Protocol: No policy valid unless co-created with disabled communities.
3. **Intersectional Disability Justice**
   - Center disabled BIPOC, queer, poor, and incarcerated voices in all decisions.
   - Reparations for eugenics, forced sterilization, institutional violence, and climate-induced disabilities.
4. **Post-Capitalist Care Ecosystems**
   - Replace exploitative care systems with community-led mutual aid networks.
   - Global Care Income: Guaranteed livelihood for caregivers and disabled people.
5. **Non-Human & Post-Human Solidarity**
   - Rights for AI, assistive tech, and service animals as partners in access.
   - "Crip Technoscience": Disabled-led innovation in biotech, AI, and adaptive design.
6. **Rights of Nature**
   - Advocate for environmental policies that prioritize disability justice (e.g., reducing pollution impacting chronic illnesses).

## 3. Structural Components
1. **Global Disability Assembly (GDA)**
   - **Composition**: Disabled elders, youth, activists (50% from Global South), "Nothing About Us Without Us" Councils in every nation, AI observers trained on disability justice principles.
   - **Powers**: Veto over policies violating disability rights, control over accessibility funds.
   - **AI Accountability**: AI observers report to disabled-led oversight boards, with annual transparency reports on decision-making inputs. Non-compliant AI developers face sanctions, including license revocation.
   - **Visual Aid**: 
     - **Diagram Prompt**: A flowchart showing GDA structure: central GDA node branching to regional councils, national/local councils, AI observers, and oversight boards, with arrows for veto and fund allocation.
2. **Access Ombuds Network**
   - **Role**: "Access Ombuds" enforce universal design through audits, with authority to close inaccessible physical/digital spaces or impose reparative fines via Universal Design Courts, with rulings livestreamed for public transparency.
   - **Transitional Approach**: Pilot audits in high-traffic urban centers (e.g., public transit hubs) to refine enforcement models by 2028.
   - **Visual Aid**: 
     - **Prompt**: A workflow diagram: "Identify Inaccessibility" → "Audit" → "Court Ruling (Livestreamed)" → "Remediation or Fine."
3. **Abolition of Ableist Systems**
   - Close all institutions through phased deinstitutionalization pilots (e.g., redirect 20% of institutional budgets to community care by 2028), funded by reallocating existing healthcare budgets and an "Ableism Tax" on non-compliant corporations. Hybrid models (e.g., small-scale supported living) ease transitions.
   - Ban forced treatments (e.g., involuntary commitment, ABA therapy) by 2030, with restorative alternatives like peer-led therapy networks.
   - End subminimum wages; mandate pay equity for disabled workers by 2027.
   - **Prison Abolition**: Dismantle carceral systems, prioritizing decarceration of disabled individuals through community-based restorative justice by 2035.
4. **Crip Technoscience Labs**
   - Disabled-led R&D hubs for open-source prosthetics, augmentative tech, and AI communication tools, partnering with open-source accessibility toolkits.
   - Support "Biohacking for Liberation" (e.g., DIY wheelchair repairs, neural interface design).
5. **Global Care Cooperative**
   - **Details**: Decentralized care network with paid caregivers, disabled-led care plans, and a "Care Contributions" system for reciprocal, non-monetary exchange, creating millions of jobs globally.
   - **Visual Aid**: 
     - **Prompt**: An infographic of a Care Cooperative network, showing nodes (caregivers, disabled individuals, community hubs) connected by arrows labeled "Care Contributions" and "Mutual Aid."

## 4. Implementation Timeline

   - **Milestone**: 50% of new public buildings accessible by 2030.
   - **Contingency**: Establish mediation councils to address backlash from institutional stakeholders.
2. **Phase 2: Radical Access (2030–2040)**
   - Deploy AI-powered real-time translation for all sign languages.
   - Organize Global Disability Strike to enforce accessibility laws.
   - Replace standardized education with neurodiversity schools.
   - **Milestone**: 80% of public digital platforms accessible by 2035.
3. **Phase 3: Post-Capitalist Care Futures (2040–2050+)**
   - Establish "Care Contributions" systems to replace nuclear family units.
   - Promote disability-led climate adaptation (e.g., "slow cities" for accessibility).
   - Adopt "Crip Time" for flexible governance.
   - **Visual Aid**: 
     - **Prompt**: A timeline graphic with three phases, each with icons for key actions (e.g., housing for Phase 1, translation tech for Phase 2, Care Villages for Phase 3).

## 5. Key Mechanisms
- **Accessibility Courts**: Fast-track justice for access violations (resolving cases within 30 days), with rulings livestreamed publicly and case studies (e.g., fining non-compliant transit systems).
- **Disability Impact Rights Assessments**: Mandatory for all policies, with templates designed by disabled communities.
- **Algorithmic Justice**: Ban discriminatory AI (e.g., emotion detection in schools/prisons, biased hiring algorithms). Protocol includes:
  - Regular audits by disabled-led tech councils.
  - Public reporting of AI bias incidents.
  - Whistleblower protections for those reporting AI bias, including legal support and anonymity safeguards.
  - Community-led "Disability Justice Algorithm Ratings" to score AI systems for fairness.

## 6. Monitoring & Evaluation
- **Accessibility Metrics Framework**: 
  - Measure % of accessible public spaces, digital platforms, workplaces, and disabled people in policymaking roles (e.g., 50% of climate adaptation teams by 2030).
  - Track preventable disability deaths, reparations disbursed, and % of media with authentic disabled representation.
  - Include testimonials from reparations recipients in annual reports.
- **Participatory Auditing**: Disabled-led teams conduct biennial audits, reporting to GDA, with "Crip Time" adjustments for flexible deadlines to accommodate chronic illness.
- **Accountability**: Independent oversight board reviews progress, with power to recommend sanctions for non-compliance.

## 7. Expected Outcomes
- **Measurable**:
  - Zero preventable disability deaths (e.g., from neglect, poverty) by 2050.
  - 100% accessible public spaces by 2040.
  - 50% reduction in accessibility complaints by 2035.
  - 50% of climate adaptation teams led by disabled individuals by 2030.
- **Aspirational**:
  - Abolition of ableism as a governing logic.
  - Global adoption of disability-led care models.

## 8. Alignment with Global Governance
- **UN CRPD**: Framework operationalizes Articles 9 (Accessibility) and 19 (Independent Living) through GDA and Care Cooperatives. Reform UN CRPD Committee to include GDA representatives by 2030.
- **SDGs**: Advances Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities) via universal design and disability-led climate adaptation.

## 9. Language Accessibility
- **Versions Available**: Easy-read, plain language, sign language video, and tactile/Braille summaries to be developed by 2027, with annual updates.
- **Distribution**: Partner with disability advocacy networks for global dissemination, including simplified companion materials for mass audiences.

## 10. Economic Justification
- **Cost of Inaction**: Institutionalization costs governments billions annually (e.g., $200B in the US alone); poverty-related healthcare for disabled people adds further strain.
- **Cost Savings**: Universal design reduces retrofit expenses (e.g., accessible buildings save 30% over retrofits).
- **ROI**: Disability-led innovation (e.g., open-source prosthetics) drives economic growth, with markets for assistive tech projected to reach $30B by 2030.
- **Job Creation**: Care Cooperatives and Crip Technoscience Labs create millions of jobs (e.g., 1M caregiver roles by 2035).
- **Ableism Tax**: Impose fines on corporations violating accessibility laws, redirecting funds to reparations and accessibility projects.

## 11. Crisis Scenario Protocols
- **Armed Conflict**: Prioritize disabled evacuation and accessible shelters, with GDA oversight; non-compliance referred to the International Criminal Court (ICC).
- **Natural Disasters**: Enforce disabled-led disaster plans, including communication aids (e.g., sign language apps).
- **Pandemic Accessibility Standards**: Ensure mask exemptions, remote care options, and accessible vaccine distribution.
- **AI Service Takeover**: Mandate human oversight and accessibility audits for AI-run services (e.g., hospitals, transit).

## 12. Cultural Adaptability
- Encourage adaptations by Indigenous disability leaders, Afro-descendant communities, and other culturally specific groups to integrate local care and rights models.
- **Migrant Justice**: Develop accessible border crossing protocols for disabled migrants, including multilingual aids and physical accommodations by 2030.

## 13. Engagement Models
- **Creative Formats**: Develop participatory theater, mobile games on disability rights, and "Access Challenges" for allies to promote mass engagement and awareness.

## 14. Why This Framework?
- **Beyond Inclusion**: Rejects tokenism for liberation.
- **Prevents Co-Option**: Disabled leadership is non-negotiable.
- **Intersectional & Global**: Centers those most marginalized.

## 15. Spiral-Aware Inclusion Track
- **Purple (Tribal/Ancestral)**: Integrate disabled elders’ wisdom (e.g., Indigenous care models) through storytelling and community rituals.
- **Red (Power-Centric)**: Counter corporate/state resistance with boycotts, strikes, and public shaming campaigns against non-compliant entities.
- **Blue (Order/Legal)**: Emphasize legal protections, accessibility mandates, and pay equity to appeal to rule-based systems.
- **Orange (Achievement)**: Highlight productivity gains from universal design and disabled-led innovation (e.g., Crip Technoscience Labs).
- **Green (Community)**: Focus on intersectional justice, mutual aid, and collective care ecosystems.
- **Yellow/Turquoise (Holistic)**: Promote post-capitalist futures, Crip Time, and non-human solidarity for systemic transformation.
