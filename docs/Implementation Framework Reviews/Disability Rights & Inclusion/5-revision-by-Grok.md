# Framework Outline: Radical Disability Rights & Inclusion in Global Governance

## 1. Vision
- **Title**: *Nothing About Us Without Us – A Liberated Future for All Bodies and Minds*
- **Goal**: Reimagine global governance through disability justice, intersectional solidarity, and post-capitalist access.
- **Core Approach**: Center disabled leadership to dismantle ableist systems and build universal design, collective care, and embodied sovereignty.
- **Rights of Nature Intersection**: Recognize that toxic environments (e.g., pollution, climate disasters) disproportionately harm disabled bodies, integrating ecological health into disability justice.
- **Visual Aid**: 
  - **Diagram Prompt**: A circular infographic with "Disabled Leadership" at the center, radiating to six segments (Embodied Sovereignty, Radical Access, Intersectional Justice, Post-Capitalist Care, Non-Human Solidarity, Rights of Nature), each with icons (e.g., wheelchair for access, tree for nature).

## 2. Core Principles
1. **Embodied Sovereignty**
   - Right to self-determination, including refusal of forced treatment or institutionalization.
   - Legal recognition of neurodivergence, chronic illness, and madness as valid ways of being (e.g., depathologizing conditions like schizophrenia in diagnostic manuals via global health policy reform).
2. **Radical Access**
   - Mandate universal design in all infrastructure, digital spaces, and governance systems.
   - "Access as a Human Right" Protocol: No policy valid unless co-created with disabled communities.
3. **Intersectional Disability Justice**
   - Center disabled BIPOC, queer, poor, and incarcerated voices in all decisions.
   - Reparations for eugenics, forced sterilization, and institutional violence.
4. **Post-Capitalist Care Ecosystems**
   - Replace exploitative care systems with community-led mutual aid networks.
   - Global Care Income: Guaranteed livelihood for caregivers and disabled people.
5. **Non-Human & Post-Human Solidarity**
   - Rights for AI, assistive tech, and service animals as partners in access.
   - "Crip Technoscience": Disabled-led innovation in biotech, AI, and adaptive design.
6. **Rights of Nature**
   - Advocate for environmental policies that prioritize disability justice (e.g., reducing pollution impacting chronic illnesses).

## 3. Structural Components
1. **Global Disability Assembly (GDA)**
   - **Composition**: Disabled elders, youth, activists (50% from Global South), "Nothing About Us Without Us" Councils in every nation, AI observers trained on disability justice principles.
   - **Powers**: Veto over policies violating disability rights, control over accessibility funds.
   - **AI Accountability**: AI observers report to disabled-led oversight boards, with annual transparency reports on their decision-making inputs.
   - **Visual Aid**: 
     - **Diagram Prompt**: A flowchart showing GDA structure: central GDA node branching to regional councils, national/local councils, AI observers, and oversight boards, with arrows for veto and fund allocation.
2. **Access Ombuds Network**
   - **Role**: "Access Ombuds" enforce universal design through audits, with authority to close inaccessible physical/digital spaces or impose reparative fines via Universal Design Courts.
   - **Transitional Approach**: Pilot audits in high-traffic urban centers (e.g., public transit hubs) to refine enforcement models.
   - **Visual Aid**: 
     - **Prompt**: A workflow diagram: "Identify Inaccessibility" → "Audit" → "Court Ruling" → "Remediation or Fine."
3. **Abolition of Ableist Systems**
   - Close all institutions through phased deinstitutionalization pilots (e.g., redirect 20% of institutional budgets to community care by 2028).
   - Ban forced treatments (e.g., involuntary commitment, ABA therapy) by 2030, with restorative alternatives like peer-led therapy networks.
   - End subminimum wages; mandate pay equity for disabled workers by 2027.
   - **Prison Abolition**: Dismantle carceral systems, prioritizing decarceration of disabled individuals (overrepresented in prisons) through community-based restorative justice by 2035.
4. **Crip Technoscience Labs**
   - Disabled-led R&D hubs for open-source prosthetics, augmentative tech, and AI communication tools.
   - Support "Biohacking for Liberation" (e.g., DIY wheelchair repairs, neural interface design).
5. **Global Care Cooperative**
   - **Details**: Decentralized care network with paid caregivers, disabled-led care plans, and a "Care Credits" system for reciprocal, non-monetary exchange.
   - **Visual Aid**: 
     - **Prompt**: An infographic of a Care Cooperative network, showing nodes (caregivers, disabled individuals, community hubs) connected by arrows labeled "Care Credits" and "Mutual Aid."

## 4. Implementation Timeline
1. **Phase 1: Abolition & Repair (2025–2030)**
   - Launch deinstitutionalization pilots; redirect 20% of institutional budgets to housing-first policies by 2028.
   - Initiate reparations payments to survivors of eugenics and forced treatment, targeting 50% of stolen wages repaid by 2035.
   - Mandate universal design in all new infrastructure.
   - **Disaster Preparedness**: Develop disabled-led climate adaptation plans (e.g., accessible evacuation protocols) by 2028.
   - **Milestone**: 50% of new public buildings accessible by 2030.
   - **Contingency**: Establish mediation councils to address backlash from institutional stakeholders.
2. **Phase 2: Radical Access (2030–2040)**
   - Deploy AI-powered real-time translation for all sign languages.
   - Organize Global Disability Strike to enforce accessibility laws.
   - Replace standardized education with neurodiversity schools.
   - **Milestone**: 80% of public digital platforms accessible by 2035.
3. **Phase 3: Post-Capitalist Crip Futures (2040–2050+)**
   - Establish "Care Villages" to replace nuclear family models.
   - Promote disability-led climate adaptation (e.g., "slow cities" for chronic illness).
   - Adopt "Crip Time" for flexible, non-linear governance.
   - **Visual Aid**: 
     - **Prompt**: A timeline graphic with three phases, each with icons for key actions (e.g., housing for Phase 1, translation tech for Phase 2, Care Villages for Phase 3).

## 5. Key Mechanisms
- **Accessibility Courts**: Fast-track justice for access violations (resolving cases within 30 days), with case studies (e.g., fining non-compliant transit systems).
- **Disability Impact Assessments**: Mandatory for all policies, with templates co-designed by disabled communities.
- **Algorithmic Justice**: Ban discriminatory AI (e.g., emotion detection AI in schools/prisons, biased hiring algorithms). Protocol includes:
  - Regular audits by disabled-led tech councils.
  - Public reporting of AI bias incidents.
  - Whistleblower protections for those reporting AI bias, including legal support and anonymity safeguards.

## 6. Monitoring & Evaluation
- **Accessibility Metrics Framework**: 
  - Measure % of accessible public spaces, digital platforms, and workplaces annually.
  - Track preventable disability deaths, reparations disbursed, and % of media with authentic disabled representation.
- **Participatory Auditing**: Disabled-led teams conduct biennial audits, reporting to GDA, with "Crip Time" adjustments for flexible deadlines to accommodate chronic illness.
- **Accountability**: Independent oversight board reviews progress, with power to recommend sanctions for non-compliance.

## 7. Expected Outcomes
- Zero preventable disability deaths (e.g., from neglect, poverty) by 2050.
- 100% accessible public spaces by 2040.
- Abolition of ableism as a governing logic.
- **Mid-Term Milestone**: 50% reduction in accessibility complaints by 2035.

## 8. Alignment with Global Governance
- **UN CRPD**: Framework operationalizes Articles 9 (Accessibility) and 19 (Independent Living) through GDA and Care Cooperatives. Propose reforming the UN CRPD Committee to include GDA representatives by 2030.
- **SDGs**: Advances Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities) via universal design and disability-led climate adaptation.

## 9. Language Accessibility
- **Versions Available**: Easy-read, plain language, sign language video, and tactile/Braille summaries to be developed for all framework documents.
- **Distribution**: Partner with disability advocacy networks for global dissemination.

## 10. Why This Framework?
- **Beyond Inclusion**: Rejects tokenism for liberation.
- **Prevents Co-Option**: Disabled leadership is non-negotiable.
- **Intersectional & Global**: Centers those most marginalized.

## 11. Spiral-Aware Inclusion Track
- **Red (Power-Centric)**: Counter corporate/state resistance with boycotts, strikes, and public shaming campaigns against non-compliant entities.
- **Blue (Order/Legal)**: Emphasize legal protections, accessibility mandates, and pay equity to appeal to rule-based systems.
- **Orange (Achievement)**: Highlight productivity gains from universal design and disabled-led innovation (e.g., Crip Technoscience Labs).
- **Green (Community)**: Focus on intersectional justice, mutual aid, and collective care ecosystems.
- **Yellow/Turquoise (Holistic)**: Promote post-capitalist futures, Crip Time, and non-human solidarity for systemic transformation.

## 12. Next Steps
1. Convene disabled-led drafting councils to refine framework language, develop easy-read and Braille versions, and co-create with intellectual disability advocates.
2. Launch pilot "Care Cooperatives" in disability justice hubs (e.g., Oakland, Berlin, Nairobi).
3. Organize Global Accessibility Strike to demand framework ratification.
4. Draft model legislation for Accessibility Courts and Care Cooperatives.
5. Establish GDA prototype councils in three cities (e.g., Nairobi, Berlin, Rio).
