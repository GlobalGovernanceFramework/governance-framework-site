# Executive Summary
The *Radical Disability Freedom Framework* reimagines governance through a disability justice lens, centering disabled leadership to dismantle ableism and build universal design, collective care, and liberated sovereignty. Key innovations include the Global Disability Alliance (GDA) with suspensive veto power, Access Ombuds Network enforcing universal design, Crip Technology Labs for disabled-led innovation, Care Cooperatives for equitable care, and an "Ableism Tax" funding reparations. Integrating intersectional justice, climate action, and AI ethics, it targets zero preventable disability deaths and 100% accessible spaces by 2040. A "Framework Family" (Full, Light, Core, Technical) offers entry points, supported by pilots, coalitions with climate, labor, Indigenous, and tech movements, a Just Transition for workers, and detailed operational tools like a Pilot Playbook.

## 1. Vision
- **Title**: *Nothing About Us Without Us – A Liberated Future for All Bodies and Minds*
- **Goal**: Transform global systems via disability justice, intersectional solidarity, and post-capitalist access.
- **Core Approach**: Center disabled leadership to eradicate ableist structures and foster universal design, collective care, and embodied sovereignty.
- **Rights of Nature**: Recognize toxic environments (e.g., pollution, climate disasters) disproportionately harm disabled bodies, integrating ecological health with climate reparations.
- **Visual Aid**: 
  - **Diagram Prompt**: Circular infographic with "Disabled Leadership" center, radiating to six segments (Embodied Sovereignty, Radical Access, Intersectional Justice, Post-Capitalist Care, Non-Human Solidarity, Rights of Nature), with icons (e.g., wheelchair, tree).
  - **Visual Toolkit**: Draft SVGs/mockups at [repository link placeholder] for advocacy, including a Framework Summary Infographic for schools/campaigns.

## 2. Core Principles
1. **Embodied Sovereignty**
   - Right to self-determination, rejecting forced treatment or institutionalization.
   - Legal recognition of neurodivergence, chronic illness, and mental diversity through UNCRPD reforms to depathologize conditions by 2030.
2. **Radical Access**
   - Mandate universal design, meeting WCAG 2.4+ for digital platforms by 2030.
   - "Access as a Right" Protocol: No policy valid without disabled co-creation.
3. **Intersectional Justice**
   - Center disabled BIPOC, queer, poor, and incarcerated voices.
   - Reparations for eugenics, forced treatments, and climate-induced disabilities.
4. **Post-Capitalist Care Systems**
   - Replace exploitative care with community-led mutual aid networks.
   - Global Care Income: Guaranteed livelihoods, funded by institutional budgets and "Ableism Tax."
5. **Non-Human Solidarity**
   - Rights for AI, assistive tech, and animals as access partners.
   - "Crip Tech": Disabled-led innovation in biotech, AI, adaptive design.
6. **Rights of Nature**
   - Advocate for environmental policies prioritizing disability justice.

## 3. Structural Components
1. **Global Disability Alliance (GDA)**
   - **Composition**: Disabled elders, youth, activists (50% Global South), national councils, AI observers trained in justice principles.
