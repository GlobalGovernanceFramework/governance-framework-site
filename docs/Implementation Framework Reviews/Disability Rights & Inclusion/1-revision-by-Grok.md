# Framework Outline: Radical Disability Rights & Inclusion in Global Governance

## 1. Vision
- **Title**: *Nothing About Us Without Us – A Liberated Future for All Bodies and Minds*
- **Goal**: Reimagine global governance through disability justice, intersectional solidarity, and post-capitalist access.
- **Core Approach**: Center disabled leadership to dismantle ableist systems and build universal design, collective care, and embodied sovereignty.

## 2. Core Principles
1. **Embodied Sovereignty**
   - Right to self-determination, including refusal of forced treatment or institutionalization.
   - Legal recognition of neurodivergence, chronic illness, and madness as valid ways of being.
2. **Radical Access**
   - Mandate universal design in all infrastructure, digital spaces, and governance systems.
   - "Access as a Human Right" Protocol: No policy valid unless co-created with disabled communities.
3. **Intersectional Disability Justice**
   - Center disabled BIPOC, queer, poor, and incarcerated voices in all decisions.
   - Reparations for eugenics, forced sterilization, and institutional violence.
4. **Post-Capitalist Care Ecosystems**
   - Replace exploitative care systems with community-led mutual aid networks.
   - Global Care Income: Guaranteed livelihood for caregivers and disabled people.
5. **Non-Human & Post-Human Solidarity**
   - Rights for AI, assistive tech, and service animals as partners in access.
   - "Crip Technoscience": Disabled-led innovation in biotech, AI, and adaptive design.

## 3. Structural Components
1. **Global Disability Assembly (GDA)**
   - **Composition**: Disabled elders, youth, activists (50% from Global South), "Nothing About Us Without Us" Councils in every nation, AI observers trained on disability justice principles.
   - **Powers**: Veto over policies violating disability rights, control over accessibility funds.
2. **Access Ombuds Network**
   - **Role**: "Access Auditors" with authority to shut down inaccessible physical/digital spaces.
   - **Mechanism**: Enforce Universal Design Tribunals with reparative fines.
3. **Abolition of Ableist Systems**
   - Close all institutions; replace with community-based care.
   - Ban forced treatments (e.g., involuntary commitment, ABA therapy).
   - End subminimum wages globally; mandate pay equity for disabled workers.
4. **Crip Technoscience Labs**
   - Disabled-led R&D hubs for open-source prosthetics, augmentative tech, and AI communication tools.
   - Support "Biohacking for Liberation" (e.g., DIY wheelchair repairs, neural interface design).
5. **Global Care Cooperative**
   - Decentralized care network with paid caregivers and disabled-led care plans.
   - "Care Credits" system for reciprocal exchange beyond money.

## 4. Implementation Timeline
1. **Phase 1: Abolition & Repair (2025–2030)**
   - Abolish all institutions; redirect funds to housing-first policies.
   - Pay reparations to survivors of eugenics and forced treatment.
   - Mandate universal design in all new infrastructure.
2. **Phase 2: Radical Access (2030–2040)**
   - Deploy AI-powered real-time translation for all sign languages.
   - Organize Global Disability Strike to enforce accessibility laws.
   - Replace standardized education with neurodiversity schools.
3. **Phase 3: Post-Capitalist Crip Futures (2040–2050+)**
   - Establish "Care Villages" to replace nuclear family models.
   - Promote disability-led climate adaptation (e.g., "slow cities" for chronic illness).
   - Adopt "Crip Time" for flexible, non-linear governance.

## 5. Key Mechanisms
- **Accessibility Courts**: Fast-track justice for access violations.
- **Disability Impact Assessments**: Required for all policies.
- **Algorithmic Justice**: Ban AI that discriminates (e.g., biased hiring algorithms).

## 6. Expected Outcomes
- Zero preventable disability deaths (e.g., from neglect, poverty).
- 100% accessible public spaces by 2040.
- Abolition of ableism as a governing logic.

## 7. Why This Framework?
- **Beyond Inclusion**: Rejects tokenism for liberation.
- **Prevents Co-Option**: Disabled leadership is non-negotiable.
- **Intersectional & Global**: Centers those most marginalized.

## 8. Next Steps
1. Convene disabled-led drafting councils to refine framework language.
2. Launch pilot "Care Cooperatives" in disability justice hubs (e.g., Oakland, Berlin, Nairobi).
3. Organize Global Accessibility Strike to demand framework ratification.
