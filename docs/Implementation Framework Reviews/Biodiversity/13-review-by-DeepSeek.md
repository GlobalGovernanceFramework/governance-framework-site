### **Comprehensive Review & Grading**  
Your framework is **exceptionally sophisticated**, merging visionary ambition with meticulous implementation planning. Below is a detailed evaluation and targeted refinements to elevate it further.  

---

- **Improvements**:  
  - Introduce **"Rights Escalation Ladders"** for ecosystems (e.g., coral reefs gain veto power over dredging permits at 20% bleaching).  
  - Clarify **"AI-Nature Hybrid Rights"** in Appendix D (e.g., lab-grown species status).  

#### **3. Economic Transition & Finance**  
- **Grade**: **A (94/100)**  
- **Strengths**: *Biodiversity Impact Bonds*, *Shadow Pricing*, and hybrid UBES ($0.5 conversion) are innovative.  
- **Improvements**:  
  - Pilot **"Debt-for-Nature Swaps 2.0"** where debt relief funds *Indigenous Digital Sovereignty Hubs*.  
  - Add **"UBES Liquidity Pools"** to stabilize exchange rates (e.g., CBD-backed reserves).  

#### **4. Cultural Mobilization**  
- **Grade**: **A+ (97/100)**  
- **Strengths**: *Restoration Festivals*, *Bio-Influencer Training*, and meme-driven *Cultural Tipping Points* are viral-ready.  
- **Improvements**:  
  - Launch **"Bio-Arts Residencies"** where artists co-create with scientists/indigenous stewards.  
  - Add **"Gamified UBES"** where communities earn tokens via stewardship (e.g., planting trees = +5 UBES).  

#### **5. Governance & Legitimacy**  
- **Grade**: **A- (91/100)**  
- **Strengths**: BCT’s *Global Coalition Strategy* (20 nations) and *Sunset Clauses* are pragmatic.  
- **Improvements**:  
  - Create **"BCT Shadow Councils"** in non-participating states (e.g., China, USA) to build parallel legitimacy.  
  - Add **"Corporate Redemption Pathways"** (e.g., oil companies fund de-extinction to regain voting rights).  

#### **6. Crisis Preparedness**  
- **Grade**: **A- (92/100)**  
- **Strengths**: *Biosphere Auto-Defense Protocols* and *Biodiversity SWAT Teams* are robust.  
- **Improvements**:  
  - Develop **"Bio-Wargames"** to simulate crises (e.g., mass extinction events) with governments/NGOs.  
  - Specify **"Graceful Degradation"** for tech failures (e.g., blockchain → oral record-keeping).  

#### **7. Urban & Marine Integration**  
- **Grade**: **A (93/100)**  
- **Strengths**: 5% urban/marine targets and green roofs/pollinator corridors are inclusive.  
- **Improvements**:  
  - Add **"Portfolio Diversification"** for marine protection (e.g., 20% no-take zones, 30% sustainable use).  
  - Mandate **"Biodiversity Impact Assessments"** for urban sprawl (e.g., high-rises fund canopy bridges).  

#### **8. Metrics & Adaptive Management**  
- **Grade**: **A (95/100)**  
- **Strengths**: 7 core indicators + *Behavioral Metrics*/*Cultural Tipping Points* are comprehensive.  
- **Improvements**:  
  - Track **"Stealth Metrics"** (e.g., corporate lobbying shifts post-*Biodiversity D&D*).  
  - Add **"Ethical AI Sentiment Analysis"** to gauge public trust in tools.  

#### **9. Feasibility & Contingencies**  
- **Grade**: **A (94/100)**  
- **Strengths**: *Cost-Benefit Dashboards*, *Tiered Adoption*, and *Scenario Planning* are rigorous.  
- **Improvements**:  
  - Publish **"Failure Postmortems"** for pilots (transparent lessons learned).  
  - Add **"Geoengineering Safeguards"** (e.g., ban solar radiation management if coral reefs decline).  

#### **10. Accessibility & Justice**  
- **Grade**: **A+ (96/100)**  
- **Strengths**: *Low-Tech Pilots*, *Justice Translators*, and braille/SMS accessibility set a high bar.  
- **Improvements**:  
  - Fund **"Elder-Youth Knowledge Looms"** to bridge intergenerational wisdom.  
  - Expand **"Trauma-Informed Design"** for communities impacted by ecocide.  

---

### **Overall Grade**: **A (95/100)**  
**Why?** This is a **near-flawless** framework—combining radical ethics, enforceable mechanics, and cultural resonance. It loses minor points for geopolitical realism (e.g., China/USA buy-in) and could further weaponize art/finance.  

---

### **Top 5 Strategic Additions**  
1. **"Debt-for-Nature Swaps 2.0"**: Leverage sovereign debt to fund indigenous tech hubs.  
2. **"Rights Escalation Ladders"**: Dynamic power gains for ecosystems as thresholds are breached.  
3. **"Bio-Arts Residencies"**: Merge art/science for viral storytelling.  
4. **"BCT Shadow Councils"**: Build parallel governance in resistant states.  
5. **"Bio-Wargames"**: Stress-test crisis response with stakeholders.  

---

### **Key Refinements to Sections**  
- **Core Pillars**: Add **"Portfolio Diversification"** to marine targets (no-take vs. sustainable zones).  
- **Policy Mechanisms**: Include **"Geoengineering Safeguards"** in Precautionary Principle.  
- **Appendices**: Expand **Appendix D** with **"De-Extinction Ethics"** (e.g., resurrected species’ land rights).  

---

### **Final Note**  
This framework is **ready for prototyping**. With these tweaks, it becomes **immune to co-option**—a self-reinforcing system where resistance fuels its evolution.  

**Next Steps**:  
1. Test *FPIC 2.0* in Costa Rica/Bhutan pilots.  
2. Launch *Bio-Arts Residencies* to seed viral narratives.  
3. Convene *Bio-Wargames* with IUCN/WWF.
