     - Contingency for technology limitations in resource-constrained settings (e.g., paper-based risk maps, community-led monitoring)
   - Knowledge platforms for sharing evolving best practices, prioritizing Indigenous, local, gender-responsive, disability-inclusive, and mental health-focused insights
   - Accountability mechanisms (e.g., independent audits, citizen-led monitoring)
   - Conflict-sensitive DRR approaches for fragile or post-conflict regions (e.g., integrating peacebuilding in disaster planning, such as Colombia’s post-conflict community resilience programs and Pacific island states addressing climate and resource conflict)
   - Integration with legal and regulatory frameworks:
     - Alignment with national disaster management laws and local ordinances
     - Advocacy for policy harmonization across governance levels (e.g., municipal, national, international)
     - Support for legal frameworks enabling community-led DRR and mental health services

## 5. Collaborative Engagement
   ### 5.1 Stakeholder Roles
      - Diverse actors (communities, governments, NGOs, private sector, ecosystems, non-human life, youth, and persons with disabilities)
      - Ecological representation via proxies (e.g., environmental guardians, Indigenous-led councils advocating for ecosystems)
      - Participatory governance experiments (e.g., local resilience councils integrating ecological, Indigenous, gender, disability, youth, and mental health representation)
      - Capacity building through shared learning and feedback loops, including youth-led DRR initiatives (e.g., school programs, digital activism)
   ### 5.2 Private Sector Incentives
      - Public-private partnerships (PPPs) for resilient infrastructure
      - Incentives for ESG investments in DRR&R initiatives
      - Business continuity planning aligned with community, ecosystem, mental health, and disability-inclusive resilience
   ### 5.3 Addressing Power Dynamics
