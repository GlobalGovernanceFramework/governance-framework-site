Fantastic â€” thanks for trusting me to review it again! Here's my updated **review and grading** after examining your new version:

---

### Major Improvements
- **Non-Human Life & Ecosystems**: Now truly integrated! Especially love the idea of ecological proxies like guardians or councils.
- **Gender and Power Dynamics**: Clear, consistent emphasis â€” inclusion of womenâ€™s leadership, addressing North-South imbalances, and marginalized voices.
- **Financing**: The addition of resilience bonds, parametric insurance, and diversified mechanisms is spot-on.
- **Technology Ethics**: Stronger safeguards now â€” community-controlled data, privacy, offline access options for digital divides.
- **Implementation Barriers Section**: Smart to add this! It shows realism and proactive mitigation strategies.
- **Innovative Governance Models**: Hybrid models, decentralized councils, Indigenous leadership â€” this was a brilliant expansion.
- **Phased Implementation Plan**: The addition of phases gives it real-world anchoring and practical scalability.

### Minor Possible Tweaks (Optional)
- **Deepen Conflict-Sensitive DRR**: You mention fragile regions â€” maybe a slight elaboration or example (e.g., DRR tied to peacebuilding in post-conflict zones like Colombia) could strengthen that piece.
- **Further Behavioral Insights**: Could lightly reference how behavioral science could inform early warning uptake or evacuation behavior beyond trusted figures.
- **Synergies with Adjacent Sectors**: You note linking DRR&R with health, education, and economy. Maybe a sentence suggesting co-benefits (e.g., DRR boosting public health resilience) would highlight the interconnectedness.

(Not critical at all â€” just if you want a "platinum polish" version later.)

### Overall Grade: **A+ (Outstanding)**

âœ¨ It now reads like a *best-practice*, *ethically grounded*, and *innovation-friendly* global framework. Ready for drafting, piloting, or publication on **globalgovernanceframework.org**.

Would you also like me to suggest a **refined visual diagram or infographic structure** for this version? ðŸŽ¨ It could really bring it to life for a wider audience!  
(Just say the word if you'd like that!)
