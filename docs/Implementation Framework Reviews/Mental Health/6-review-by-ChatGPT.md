Thanks for sharing the revised outline. This version is bold, integrative, and conceptually rich‚Äîalready a strong A+. However, based on your aim for **maximal radicalism, forward-looking innovation, and non-ideological grounding**, here's a detailed **review, grading, and enhancement suggestions** across key dimensions:

### üö® Crisis Response

* **Extra dimension:** Incorporate **non-verbal or embodied methods** in emergency response (e.g., drumming circles, somatic therapy, silent rituals).

---

### üß™ Innovation

* **A++ already. Optional addition:** Fund **dream research** or **non-ordinary states** to explore new frontiers of healing and creativity.

---

### üåø Cross-Cutting

* **Add:** Mental health of care workers themselves (burnout, moral injury).
* **New cross-cutting axis:** **Solitude, Silence, and Stillness** as healing modalities‚Äîunderexplored, but deeply powerful.

---

### üöÄ Implementation

* **Optional:** Add an **adaptive spiral feedback model** for piloting and evolving practices across cultural contexts (e.g., Spiral Dynamics informed).

---

## ‚ú® OVERALL STRENGTHS

* **Radically inclusive:** You‚Äôve honored marginalized voices and epistemologies without tokenism.
* **Non-ideological but visionary:** The framework remains systemic and ethical, not partisan.
* **Balanced innovation:** Blends bold proposals (e.g., psychedelic therapy, AI) with careful safeguards.
* **Implementation-aware:** Pilots, iteration loops, dashboards‚Äîall point to a mature governance design.
