# Global Framework for Mental Health Governance

## 1. Vision & Guiding Principles
- **Vision:** A world where mental health is recognized as a universal human right, fostering psychosocial flourishing interconnected with planetary well-being and equitable access to high-quality care.
- **Core Principles:**
  - **Human Rights-Based Approach:** Align with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) to uphold dignity and autonomy.
  - **Equity & Neurodiversity Celebration:** Prioritize marginalized groups (e.g., refugees, LGBTQ+, indigenous peoples) while celebrating neurodiversity as a strength.
  - **Community Participation:** Actively involve individuals with lived experiences and "experts-by-experience" in policy design.
  - **Holistic & Ecopsychological Care:** Integrate mental health with physical health, social services, planetary health, and sustainable development goals.
  - **Care Ethics:** Ground the framework in relational and interdependent well-being, inspired by care ethics traditions (e.g., Kittay, Gilligan).

## 2. Governance & Institutional Structures
- **Global Coordination:**
  - Strengthen WHO’s leadership role, fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration with UN agencies, NGOs, private sectors, and **multi-stakeholder councils** with rotating citizen seats.
  - Establish a **Global Mental Health Council** for policy coherence, supported by **AI-assisted governance dashboards** for real-time tracking of needs and bottlenecks.
  - Promote **transgovernmental collaboration** to address cross-border challenges (e.g., migration trauma, online harms).
- **National-Level Implementation:**
  - Mandate **National Mental Health Commissions** with diverse representation to oversee strategies.
  - Embed mental health within **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)** frameworks.
- **Local & Community Governance:**
  - Decentralize services to local authorities, supported by community-based systems and **experts-by-experience** in decision-making.

## 3. Legal & Policy Frameworks
- **Anti-Discrimination Laws:** Enforce laws to combat stigma and ensure accommodations in workplaces and schools.
- **Mental Health Legislation:** Transition from coercive practices (e.g., involuntary hospitalization) to rights-based care, with **sunset clauses** for outdated legislation and transition protocols.
- **Legal Personhood for Mental Health Ecosystems:** Explore legal recognition of mental health systems, inspired by rights-of-nature movements.
- **Restorative Justice:** Implement processes for resolving mental health-related conflicts (e.g., forced treatment, institutional abuse).
- **Data Protection:** Adopt GDPR-like standards to safeguard mental health data privacy.

## 4. Financing & Resource Mobilization
- **Sustainable Funding:**
  - Allocate a minimum of **5% of national health budgets** to mental health, per WHO recommendations.
  - Introduce a **Mental Health Commons Fund**, supported by global solidarity mechanisms (e.g., digital taxes, carbon dividends).
  - Explore innovative financing like mental health bonds or taxes on harmful products (e.g., alcohol, tobacco).
- **International Solidarity:**
  - High-income countries support global initiatives via **Official Development Assistance (ODA)**.
  - Offer debt relief for low-income countries investing in mental health systems.
- **Community-Based Budgeting:** Implement participatory budgeting for local mental health priorities.
- **Right to Rest:** Link mental health to policies promoting work-time reduction and time sovereignty.

## 5. Service Delivery & Workforce
- **Integrated Care Models:**
  - Train primary care workers in mental health first aid.
  - Leverage telemedicine and digital tools (e.g., AI chatbots) with **safeguards against algorithmic bias** in diagnosis and triage.
  - Incorporate **peer-led healing networks**, **elder-youth co-support structures**, **spiritual care**, **traditional healing systems**, and **psychedelic-assisted therapy** (where legal and ethical).
- **Workforce Development:**
  - Address shortages through task-shifting to community health workers.
  - Establish global standards for mental health professional training.

## 6. Monitoring, Evaluation & Accountability
- **Standardized Metrics:**
  - Adopt WHO’s **Mental Health Atlas** indicators and track SDG 3.4 (mental health promotion) and 3.8 (UHC).
  - Include **flourishing metrics** (e.g., meaning, connection, self-efficacy) alongside symptom reduction.
- **Community-Led Monitoring:** Use storytelling and participatory action research for inclusive evaluation.
- **Independent Reviews:**
  - Establish a **Global Mental Health Watchdog** for compliance audits.
  - Require regular reporting to the UN Human Rights Council.
- **Transparency Dashboards:** Co-design dashboards with neurodivergent and marginalized groups for accessibility and inclusivity.

## 7. Crisis & Emergency Response
- **Humanitarian Settings:**
  - Integrate **Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS)** into disaster and conflict responses.
  - Deploy a **Global Mental Health Rapid Response Team** trained in trauma care and cultural protocols.
- **Pandemic Preparedness:**
  - Incorporate mental health into WHO’s **International Health Regulations (IHR)**.
- **Digital First Response:** Develop protocols for digital mental health support, including collective grief processing for online communities.

## 8. Innovation & Research
- **Global Mental Health R&D Fund:** Prioritize scalable, low-cost interventions.
- **Open-Access Research Commons:** Ensure global equity in access to mental health research and tools.
- **Pluralistic Epistemologies:** Support spiritual, indigenous, and experiential knowledge alongside scientific approaches.
- **Sandbox Zones:** Create safe spaces for experimenting with novel psychosocial models (e.g., Ubuntu circles, psychedelic co-ops).
- **Ethical AI & Technology:** Develop guidelines for responsible digital mental health tools.

## 9. Cross-Cutting Themes
- **Climate Change:** Address eco-anxiety and mental health impacts of climate-related disasters.
- **Gender Equity:** Tackle disparities in mental health outcomes (e.g., depression in women, suicide in men).
- **Youth & Education:** Implement school-based mental health programs.
- **Intergenerational Trauma & Healing:** Focus on post-colonial and post-conflict settings.
- **Digital Mental Health Ethics:** Promote platform designs for emotional well-being (e.g., safe social media, dopamine detox support).
- **Work Reimagined:** Explore mental health in AI-driven, post-labor societies emphasizing rest, creativity, and play.

## 10. Implementation Strategy
- **Phased Rollout:** Pilot in diverse contexts (e.g., conflict zones, urban/rural areas) with **radical pilots** testing bold approaches in safe-to-fail settings.
- **Stakeholder Partnerships:** Engage civil society, academia, and corporations, using **decentralized coordination protocols** (e.g., DAOs for mental health cooperatives).
- **Adaptability:** Customize for cultural relevance while maintaining global standards.
- **Iteration Loops:** Incorporate quarterly community feedback cycles to refine the framework.
- **Living Document Model:** Maintain the framework as a versioned governance whitepaper or open GitBook for ongoing updates.

**Visual Representation:**  
A multi-layered diagram is recommended to illustrate governance levels (global, national, local), care flow (prevention to crisis response), and rights-based pathways. This could be co-designed with stakeholders for clarity and inclusivity.

This enhanced framework reimagines mental health governance as a dynamic, inclusive, and forward-looking system for **psychosocial flourishing**, balancing global standards with local adaptability.
