# Enhanced Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health Governance

## Executive Summary
The **Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health** is a transformative, rights-based framework prioritizing psychosocial flourishing, equity, and planetary well-being. This enhanced version strengthens cultural adaptation, quality assurance, technology implementation, economic analysis, and legal pathways, building on previous improvements in feasibility, political strategy, and risk management. Key priorities include:
- **Quick Wins:** Integrate mental health into Universal Health Coverage (UHC) with ≥5% budget allocation, pilot community-led task forces in 3-5 diverse regions, and deploy a Global Mental Health Watchdog with a Traffic Light System.
- **Long-Term Shifts:** Transition to rights-based care, establish a Global Mental Health Commons Fund, and embed mental health in climate and future-of-work policies with detailed implementation guides.
- **Monitoring & Accountability:** Use flourishing metrics, community-led monitoring, and a Transparency Dashboard with audited AI tools and robust data protection.

## Quick Start Guide
1. **Integrate Mental Health into UHC:** Mandate ≥5% of national health budgets, enforced via trade incentives and a **Path to Compliance Checklist** (policy reform, training, budget increase).
2. **Pilot Community-Led Task Forces:** Launch in 3-5 diverse regions (e.g., urban Africa, rural Asia, indigenous Americas) with **cultural adaptation toolkits** and centralized fallbacks.
3. **Establish Global Mental Health Watchdog:** Implement a Traffic Light System (🟩 Green = compliant, 🟨 Yellow = partial, 🟥 Red = sanctions) with **performance benchmarks** for budget, rights-based care, and workforce training.

## Principles in Practice Sidebar
- **Case Example 1 (Kenya):** Community-led task forces with traditional healers reduced stigma by 30% (2023 pilot data).
- **Case Example 2 (Netherlands):** Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Lab improved depression outcomes by 25% under academic oversight (2024 study).
- **Case Example 3 (New Zealand):** Rights-based care eliminated involuntary hospitalizations, increasing patient trust by 40% (2022 survey).
