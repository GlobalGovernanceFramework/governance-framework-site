Your Mental Health Governance framework is already strong, with clear structure, progressive principles, and multi-scalar implementation. That said, to make it *maximally radical, forward-looking, and non-ideological* as you intend, here are targeted improvement suggestions by section:

---

### 🌍 1. Vision & Guiding Principles

**Suggestions:**

* **Add a planetary wellbeing dimension**: Frame mental health as not just individual but ecopsychological—connected to planetary health.
* Consider including **neurodiversity celebration**, not only inclusion.
* Add a **“care ethics” grounding**, highlighting relational and interdependent well-being (e.g., Kittay, Gilligan traditions).

---

### 🏛️ 2. Governance & Institutional Structures

**Suggestions:**

* Introduce **multi-stakeholder councils** with rotating citizen seats or “experts-by-experience” at all governance levels.
* Consider **AI-assisted mental health governance dashboards** to track needs and system bottlenecks in real time.
* Add **transgovernmental collaboration** on cross-border mental health challenges (e.g. migration trauma, online harms).

---

### ⚖️ 3. Legal & Policy Frameworks

**Suggestions:**

* Include a clause for **legal personhood of mental health ecosystems**, inspired by rights-of-nature movements.
* Add **sunset clauses** for outdated or harmful legislation (e.g. involuntary hospitalization), paired with transition protocols.
* Consider **restorative justice processes** in mental health-related conflicts (e.g., forced treatment cases, institutional abuse).

---

### 💰 4. Financing & Resource Mobilization

**Suggestions:**

* Introduce a **Mental Health Commons Fund**, funded through global solidarity mechanisms (digital tax, carbon dividends).
* Encourage **community-based participatory budgeting** to fund local mental health priorities.
* Add a **Right to Rest** or “Time Sovereignty” clause—linking mental health to work-time reduction policies.

---

### 🧠 5. Service Delivery & Workforce

**Suggestions:**

* Introduce **peer-led healing networks** and **elder-youth co-support structures** to reduce dependence on clinical models.
* Incorporate **spiritual care, traditional healing systems**, and **psychedelic-assisted therapy** (where legal and ethical).
* Add **safeguards against algorithmic bias** in AI/telemedicine tools used for diagnosis and triage.

---

### 📊 6. Monitoring, Evaluation & Accountability

**Suggestions:**

* Integrate **community-led monitoring** with storytelling and participatory action research.
* Track **not just symptom reduction but flourishing metrics** (e.g., meaning, connection, self-efficacy).
* Add **transparency dashboards** co-designed with neurodivergent and marginalized groups.

---

### 🚨 7. Crisis & Emergency Response

**Suggestions:**

* Introduce a **Global Mental Health Rapid Response Team**, co-trained in trauma care and cultural protocols.
* Add protocols for **digital mental health first response**, including collective grief processing for online communities.

---

### 🧪 8. Innovation & Research

**Suggestions:**

* Propose **open-access mental health research commons** to ensure global equity in access to findings and tools.
* Add support for **pluralistic epistemologies**—embracing spiritual, indigenous, and experiential ways of knowing.
* Create **sandbox zones** for experimenting with novel psychosocial models (e.g. Ubuntu circles, psychedelic co-ops).

---

### 🔄 9. Cross-Cutting Themes

**Suggestions:**

* Add a subsection on **intergenerational trauma & healing**, especially in post-colonial and post-conflict settings.
* Include **digital mental health ethics**, e.g., platform design for emotional well-being (safe social media, dopamine detox support).
* Introduce **“Work Reimagined”**: exploring mental health in AI-driven, post-labor societies (rest, creativity, play).

---

### 🚀 10. Implementation Strategy

**Suggestions:**

* Include **“radical pilots”** alongside traditional pilots—test bold approaches in safe-to-fail contexts.
* Integrate **decentralized coordination protocols** (e.g. DAOs for mental health cooperatives).
* Ensure **iteration loops** based on community feedback, with quarterly reflection cycles.

---

### ✨ Overall Enhancements

* Frame the whole as **“governance for psychosocial flourishing”**, not merely illness treatment.
* Add visuals or diagrams to map governance layers, flow of care, or rights-based pathways.
* Consider a **living document model** (e.g. versioned governance whitepaper or open GitBook).
