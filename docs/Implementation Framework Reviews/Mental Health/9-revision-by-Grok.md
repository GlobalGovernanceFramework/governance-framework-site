# Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health Governance

## Executive Summary
The **Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health** is a rights-based, inclusive, and adaptive framework prioritizing psychosocial flourishing, equity, and planetary well-being. Key priorities include:
- **Quick Wins:** Integrate mental health into Universal Health Coverage (UHC), train primary care workers in mental health first aid, establish community-led task forces.
- **Long-Term Shifts:** Transition to rights-based care, create a Global Mental Health Commons Fund, embed mental health in climate and future-of-work policies.
