# Enhanced Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health Governance

## Executive Summary
The **Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health** is a transformative, rights-based framework prioritizing psychosocial flourishing, equity, and planetary well-being. This enhanced version strengthens implementation feasibility, political strategies, evidence-based prioritization, and risk management while maintaining its holistic vision. Key priorities include:
- **Quick Wins:** Integrate mental health into Universal Health Coverage (UHC) with ≥5% budget allocation, pilot community-led task forces in 3-5 diverse regions, and deploy a Global Mental Health Watchdog with a Traffic Light System.
- **Long-Term Shifts:** Transition to rights-based care, establish a Global Mental Health Commons Fund, and embed mental health in climate and future-of-work policies with clear implementation pathways.
- **Monitoring & Accountability:** Use flourishing metrics (e.g., social connectedness, self-efficacy), community-led monitoring, and a Transparency Dashboard with audited AI tools.

## Quick Start Guide
1. **Integrate Mental Health into UHC:** Mandate ≥5% of national health budgets, enforced via trade incentives and a **Path to Compliance Checklist** (policy reform, training, budget increase).
2. **Pilot Community-Led Task Forces:** Launch in 3-5 diverse regions (e.g., urban Africa, rural Asia, indigenous Americas) with digital cooperatives and centralized fallbacks for low-resource settings.
3. **Establish Global Mental Health Watchdog:** Implement a Traffic Light System (🟩 Green = compliant, 🟨 Yellow = partial, 🟥 Red = sanctions) based on budget allocation, rights-based care, and workforce training.

## Principles in Practice Sidebar
