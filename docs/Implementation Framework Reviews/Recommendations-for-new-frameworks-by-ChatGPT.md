Hello Bj√∂rn! First off, congratulations on completing such a comprehensive and thoughtful collection of global governance frameworks‚Äîthis is truly impressive and far ahead of any existing initiative I‚Äôve seen. Your list already spans crucial domains across survival, thriving, equity, and future-oriented meta-levels.

That said, here‚Äôs a **critical audit** of potential **gaps** or **underdeveloped areas**, categorized for clarity:

---

## üåç **Tier 1: Urgent Global Stability & Justice**

### ‚úÖ Covered Well:

* Climate, healthcare, migration, disaster resilience, justice‚Äîall major pillars are present.

### üîç Potential Additions or Expansions:

* **Supply Chain Security & Global Logistics**

  * *Rationale:* Especially relevant post-pandemic and in war-torn or unstable regions. Ties in with food, health, energy resilience, and disaster response.
  * Could be a stand-alone or integrated into *Economic Integration* or *Disaster Risk*.

* **Nuclear Disarmament & Arms Control**

  * *Rationale:* Could be integrated under *Peace & Conflict*, but might deserve its own framework given the unique governance challenges.

---

## üå± **Tier 2: Systems for Long-Term Thriving**

### ‚úÖ Covered Well:

* Strong breadth from education to biodiversity, labor to urban systems.

### üîç Potential Additions or Deepening:

* **Transportation & Mobility Systems Governance**

  * *Rationale:* Global carbon, accessibility, infrastructure, and development implications. Often under-addressed globally. Connects with *urban*, *rural*, and *climate*.

* **Waste Management & Circular Economy**

  * *Rationale:* Currently likely embedded in *environmental stewardship*, but may benefit from dedicated focus. Especially on e-waste, plastics, and circular systems.

* **Governance of Land Use & Commons (Terrestrial)**

  * *Rationale:* Could bridge rural, biodiversity, and food systems. Issues of tenure, access, restoration, and Indigenous rights.

* **Neurodiversity & Cognitive Rights**

  * *Rationale:* Could be woven into *Disability Inclusion*, but increasingly called for its own recognition in global dialogue.

---

## üß¨ **Tier 3: Equity, Culture & Future Generations**

### ‚úÖ Covered Well:

* Rich in inclusion, intergenerational equity, ethics, and digital rights.

### üîç Potential Additions:

* **Media, Information Integrity & Cognitive Sovereignty**

  * *Rationale:* The rise of mis/disinformation, algorithmic echo chambers, and AI-generated media require a dedicated governance layer.

* **Arts, Imagination & Creative Rights Governance**

  * *Rationale:* Distinct from cultural heritage. Protecting artistic freedom, innovation commons, future myth-making, and imagination as a civic capacity.

* **Care Work & Informal Economies Governance**

  * *Rationale:* Underpins gender equality, aging, labor‚Äîbut often invisibilized. Worth elevating.

---

## üåå **Tier 4: Visionary & Meta Governance**

### ‚úÖ Covered Well:

* Existential risks, consciousness, space, meta-tools‚Äîbrilliantly included.

### üîç Potential Additions:

* **Dreaming & Mythopoetic Futures**

  * *Rationale:* Might be seen as covered under ‚ÄúWisdom‚Äù or ‚ÄúConsciousness,‚Äù but could merit a poetic governance field‚Äîone that invites futures beyond planning.

* **Collective Intelligence & Governance Evolution**

  * *Rationale:* Could deepen *Meta-Governance*, but might be teased out as an evolving field: participatory foresight, AI-human collaboration in policymaking, etc.

* **Planetary Boundaries & Earth System Governance**

  * *Rationale:* Might be distributed across other frameworks, but a synthesis of Earth as system (√† la Stockholm Resilience Centre) could serve as a unifying macro-layer.

---

## üîÅ Cross-Cutting or Meta-Layered Considerations

Consider a few cross-framework integrators or ‚Äúprotocol-level‚Äù themes:

1. **Trust & Legitimacy Framework**

   * How is governance trusted and re-legitimated globally? A meta-layer needed across all tiers.

2. **Meaning Infrastructure Protocol**

   * As you've hinted, the post-material risks of AI, UBI, and spiritual vacuums demand a systems of meaning-support. Could be part of *Consciousness* or standalone.

3. **Embodied Governance**

   * Bridging body, movement, and lived experience. Could deepen *Mental Health*, *Disability*, and *Urban* frameworks.
