Your updated framework is **exceptionally robust**—it addresses nearly all the gaps from the previous version while maintaining clarity and ambition. Below is a **detailed review**, highlighting strengths and suggesting minor refinements for even greater impact:

---

### **Strengths**  
1. **Enhanced Equity & Justice**:  
   - Explicit inclusion of **CBDR**, **reparative contributions**, and **loss/damage funding** ensures historical responsibility is operationalized.  
   - **Just Transition Compacts** and **indigenous engagement** address social dimensions often overlooked.  

2. **Stronger Governance**:  
   - **Enforcement tools** (trade penalties, climate tariffs) and the **International Climate Tribunal** make compliance tangible.  
   - **Mandatory Corporate Climate Disclosure** closes accountability gaps.  

3. **Science-Aligned Targets**:  
   - Shifting to **90-100% clean energy by 2050** (per IPCC) reflects urgency.  
   - **Digital & Behavioral Solutions** modernize the tech pillar.  

4. **Geopolitical Realism**:  
   - **Resource Diplomacy** proactively tackles mineral conflicts and phaseout tensions.

### **Suggested Refinements**  

#### **1. Refine "Clean Energy" Definition**  
   - **Issue**: "Clean energy" is ambiguous—does it include nuclear, fossil fuels with CCS, or only renewables?  
   - **Solution**: Add a footnote:  
     > *"Clean energy: Renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal) plus nuclear, excluding fossil fuels even with carbon capture (CCS)."*  

#### **2. Strengthen Adaptation Metrics**  
   - **Issue**: Success metrics focus on mitigation (1.5°C, clean energy) but lack adaptation benchmarks.  
   - **Solution**: Under **Metrics for Success**, add:  
     - **Adaptation**: "100% of vulnerable communities have climate-resilient infrastructure by 2040."  

#### **3. Clarify "Reparative Contributions"**  
   - **Issue**: The % GDP formula (0.5-1%) may face resistance without a rationale.  
   - **Solution**: Add a brief justification:  
     > *"Based on historical emissions share and ability-to-pay (e.g., Annex II nations under UNFCCC)."*  

#### **4. Expand "Resource Diplomacy"**  
   - **Issue**: Critical minerals are mentioned, but **food/water security** (e.g., transboundary conflicts) is omitted.  
   - **Solution**: Under **Challenges & Solutions**, add:  
     - **Challenge**: Climate-driven resource scarcity (water, arable land).  
       - *Solution*: Establish **Regional Resource-Sharing Pacts** with UN mediation.  

#### **5. Address "Green Colonialism" Risks**  
   - **Issue**: Renewable projects in developing nations can replicate extractive dynamics.  
   - **Solution**: Under **Stakeholder Engagement**, add:  
     > *"Ensure indigenous and local communities have veto power over land-use decisions for energy projects."*  

---

### **Minor Tweaks**  
- **Governance Structure**: Specify that the **International Climate Tribunal** includes judges from Global South nations (to avoid bias).  
- **Financing**: Note that **loss/damage funds** are distinct from adaptation (currently implied but not explicit).  
- **Policy Mechanisms**: Link **Just Transition Compacts** to **sanctions** (e.g., "Non-compliant companies barred from public contracts").  

---

### **Final Assessment**  
This is now a **state-of-the-art framework**—**clear, actionable, and justice-centered**. With the tweaks above, it could serve as a **model for real-world negotiations** (e.g., COP29).  

**Next Steps**:  
1. **Annexes**: Develop a **glossary** (e.g., "clean energy," "CBDR") and **case studies** (e.g., EU carbon border tax, Africa’s Great Green Wall).  
2. **Visuals**: Add a **governance flowchart** and **timeline infographic** for the roadmap.  
3. **Advocacy**: Draft a **"Quick Start Guide"** for policymakers (e.g., "5 Priority Actions for 2025").
