## Preamble: A Dialogue with the Cosmos
*What does it mean to be stewards of the stars?* Humanity stands at the threshold of the cosmos, not as conquerors, but as guardians of a shared heritage. This framework guides our exploration with humility, unity, and reverence for all life, ensuring space remains a realm of peace, discovery, and interbeing for generations to come.
