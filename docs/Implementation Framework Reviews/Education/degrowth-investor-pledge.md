# **The Degrowth Investor Pledge**  
### *Capital for Life, Not for Profit*  

**We, the undersigned, reject the myth of infinite growth on a finite planet. We pledge to invest in regenerative education—not as a commodity, but as a commons—by adhering to the following principles:**  

---

## **1. Zero Extraction**  
- **Cap returns at 1%** (adjusted for inflation), ensuring capital circulates without extraction.  
- **Divest from all for-profit education** ventures (e.g., privatized schools, ed-tech surveillance).  
- **No intellectual property claims** on funded curricula or tools—all outputs are open-source.  

**Commitment:**  
> *"I will not profit from the right to learn."*  

---

## **2. Reparative Investing**  
- **Allocate 10% of portfolio** to Indigenous, Global South, or refugee-led education initiatives **without repayment terms**.  
- **Pay a historical harm levy** (e.g., 2% of AUM) into community-controlled endowments.  

**Commitment:**  
> *"My capital exists to repair, not reproduce, inequality."*  

---

## **3. Democratic Governance**  
- **Funds are governed by councils** of students, teachers, and marginalized communities—not financiers.  
- **Accept binding community vetoes** on projects violating ecological or cultural integrity.  

**Commitment:**  
> *"I surrender control to those who breathe life into learning."*  

---

## **4. Degrowth Metrics**  
- **Measure success by**:  
  - **Reduction** in student debt (+10% annual progress).  
  - **Increase** in free, localized education access (e.g., 50+ community schools funded).  
  - **Decay** of financialization (e.g., divestment from standardized testing markets).  

**Commitment:**  
> *"I will shrink the education-industrial complex."*  

---

## **5. Sunset Clause**  
- **Liquidate 5% of assets yearly** into permanent trusts (e.g., land-back endowments for Indigenous schools).  
- **Phase out personal wealth** exceeding $10M—redistribute excess to teacher cooperatives.  

**Commitment:**  
> *"My privilege expires so that learning may flourish."*  

---

## **Signatories**  
### **Individual Investors**

  - Divesting $____ from extractive assets by [date].

### **Institutions**  
- [Organization] pledges:  
  - To cap all education-related returns at 1% by [date].  
  - To transfer ____% of endowment to reparative trusts.  

---

## **Enforcement & Transparency**  
- **Public audit trails**: Blockchain-ledgered fund flows with open access.  
- **Penalties**: Signatories violating terms contribute 200% of profits to debt jubilees.  

**Example Compliance:**  
> *"XYZ Capital failed to meet degrowth metrics → funds 200 solar-powered libraries in Gaza."*  

---

## **Background**  
Inspired by:  
- The **Ghanaian "Fihankra" pledge** (investors fund schools in exchange for zero financial return).  
- **Cooperative Capital Models** (e.g., Barcelona’s *FemBanc* funds education via member dues, not interest).

## **Join the Movement**  
**Next Steps:**  
1. **Sign** this pledge at [platform].  
2. **Divest** from one extractive asset within 30 days.  
3. **Fund** your first non-extractive project (see our *Degrowth Dealbook* for options).  

**Visual Symbol**: A **broken chain** encircling a seedling—worn as a lapel pin by signatories.  

---  
*"The most radical investment is one that dismantles itself."*  

**Draft Note**: Adapt the percentages/criteria for different contexts (e.g., hedge funds vs. small cooperatives). Let me know if you’d like to add a **"Degrowth Investor Toolkit"** with sample contracts!
