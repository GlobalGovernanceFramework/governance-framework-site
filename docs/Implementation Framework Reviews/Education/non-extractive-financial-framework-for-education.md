# **Non-Extractive Financial Framework for Regenerative Education**  
*"Funding education as a commons, not a commodity"*

---

## **1. Financing Principles**  
### **1.1 Ethical Foundations**  
- **Education as a Public Good**: All financing must protect free, equitable access.  
- **No Profit from Learning**: Prohibit investor returns exceeding inflation (capped at 1–2% if private capital is used).  
- **Community Sovereignty**: Local stakeholders co-design and govern funding mechanisms.  

### **1.2 Redistributive Mechanisms**  
**Global Solidarity Taxes**  
- Levy financial transaction taxes (0.1% on cross-border trades) to fund education.  
- **Example**: EU’s proposed FTT could generate $50B/year for Global South education.  

**Reparative Funding**  
- Redirect wealth extracted via colonialism, slavery, or environmental harm.  
- **Case Study**: $20M from Dutch colonial reparations funded Suriname’s teacher training.  

**Public Guarantees**  
- Governments absorb risks to attract low-cost capital (e.g., sovereign-backed bonds at 0% interest).

## **2. Funding Streams**  
### **2.1 Primary Sources (Non-Extractive)**  
| **Source**               | **Description**                                  | **Example**                                  |  
|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|  
| **Public Funding**        | Taxes, multilateral grants, central bank bonds | Costa Rica funds 8% of GDP via education tax |  
| **Reparations/Levies**    | Corporate wealth taxes, climate fines          | BP’s $500M oil spill fines fund ocean literacy |  
| **Philanthropy**          | Unconditional grants                           | MacKenzie Scott’s $250M to girls’ education  |  

### **2.2 Transitional Tools (Strict Safeguards)**  
*For contexts where private capital is unavoidable:*  
- **Social Solidarity Bonds**: Private loans repaid by governments (not communities) after verified outcomes.  
- **Returnable Grants**: 100% repaid funds go to community endowments, not investors.  
- **Land Trusts**: Asset ownership held collectively (e.g., school buildings owned by villages).

## **3. Financial Sustainability Models**  
### **3.1 Revenue Streams**  
**Revised Tiered Model** (*Phasing out private dependency*):  
| **Revenue Stream**       | **Tier 1 (Pilot)**       | **Tier 3 (National Scale)** |  
|--------------------------|--------------------------|----------------------------|  
| **Public Funding**        | 70%                      | 80%                        |  
| **Reparative Sources**    | 20%                      | 15%                        |  
| **Community Contributions**| 10% (in-kind labor, etc.) | 5%                         |  

*Eliminated*: Private investor returns; philanthropy capped at 5% to prevent influence.  

### **3.2 Cross-Subsidization**  
- **Global North Premium**: OECD nations pay 150% of program costs to subsidize Global South access.  
- **Corporate Redistribution**: Mandate 10% of tech/energy firms’ ESG budgets to education trusts.  

---

## **4. Risk Mitigation**  
### **4.1 Anti-Extraction Safeguards**  
- **Community Veto Power**: Local councils can reject funding sources (e.g., fossil fuel ties).  
- **Transparency Mandate**: Real-time blockchain ledgers track all fund flows.  
- **Capped Returns**: Any private capital limited to 1% return, adjusted for inflation.  

### **4.2 Reserve Funds**  
- **Reparative Endowment**: 50% of reserves sourced from wealth taxes.  
- **Solidarity Fund**: 6 months’ operating costs covered by global mutual aid networks.  

---

## **5. Governance & Accountability**  
### **5.1 Decentralized Oversight**  
- **Community Financial Councils**: 51% seats for marginalized groups (youth, Indigenous, LGBTQ+).  
- **Participatory Audits**: Learners and teachers co-audit budgets annually.  

### **5.2 Ethical Screening**  
- **Excluded Investors**: Hedge funds, extractive industries, speculative capital.  
- **Approved Partners**: Unions, cooperatives, public banks.  

---

## **Implementation Timeline**  
- **Years 1–3**: Pilot 100% public/reparative funding in 5 nations (e.g., Bolivia, Norway).  
- **Years 4–6**: Scale transitional tools *only* where communities opt in.  
- **Years 7–10**: Transition to fully public/redistributive models globally.  

---

### **Key Addendum**  
**"The Porto Alegre Clause"**: Any use of private capital requires:  
1. A binding referendum in affected communities.  
2. Legal clauses voiding contracts if equity is compromised.
