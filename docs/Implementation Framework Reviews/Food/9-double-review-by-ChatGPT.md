> Clear, layered, and beautifully structured with precise headings, accessible language (via inline plain-language definitions), and modular logic. Future visuals are noted — an excellent forward-thinking touch.

**✔️ Highlights**: Plain-language terms, clean flow, diagram placeholders.
**🛠 Suggestion**: Include page-length estimates or reading time for public versions.

---

### 🌍 2. Alignment with Global Goals & Treaties

**Score: 98/100 | Grade: A+++**

> Excellent integration of SDGs, Paris Agreement, CBD, **UN Right to Food**, and **UNDRIP**. This revision expanded and operationalized these connections more clearly.

**🛠 Suggestion**: Consider explicitly referencing **FAO’s Voluntary Guidelines on Food Systems & Nutrition**.

---

### 🧑🏽‍🌾 3. Stakeholder Engagement & Justice

**Score: 96/100 | Grade: A+++**

> Exceptional depth: co-governance roles, youth protocols, TEK repositories, equity protocols, and tailored mediation models. Moves beyond token inclusion toward structural justice.

**✔️ Highlights**: Co-governance with indigenous communities, youth input protocols.
**🛠 Suggestion**: Add examples of successful multi-stakeholder panels or tools.

---

### ⚙️ 4. Implementation Feasibility

**Score: 94/100 | Grade: A++**

> Now includes **institutional accountability**, scenario planning for funding, and **tech contingency plans**. This greatly increases realism and integrity.

**✔️ Highlights**: Global audits, compliance dashboards, adaptive funding.
**🛠 Suggestion**: Consider adding **regional implementation case studies** or simulation tools for planning.

---

### 🌱 5. Innovation & TEK Integration

**Score: 98/100 | Grade: A+++**

> Seamless integration of traditional and high-tech methods, with cases (e.g., iCow, Digital Green), TEK repositories, and hybrid solutions. This version represents one of the most **equity-aware tech integration models** I’ve seen.

**✔️ Highlights**: AI with TEK, blockchain transparency, low-tech access.
**🛠 Suggestion**: Include risks of surveillance or data misuse (for AI/blockchain rollouts).

---

### 📊 6. KPIs & Measurability

**Score: 96/100 | Grade: A+++**

> Balanced mix of **quantitative** and **qualitative** KPIs now clearly explained. Ties between metrics and impact logic are tight.

**✔️ Highlights**: Cultural, trust, and biodiversity metrics added.
**🛠 Suggestion**: Add timeline-aligned **KPI milestones** alongside general ones.

---

### 🌎 7. Regional Adaptability

**Score: 94/100 | Grade: A++**

> Deepened anticipatory strategies (e.g., climate instability, tech dependence), local sourcing targets, and adaptive education platforms make this deeply responsive to regional realities.

**✔️ Highlights**: Resilient food hubs, mobile farming units.
**🛠 Suggestion**: Add example personas or narratives for local regions (e.g., "Aisha the smallholder in Mali").

---

### 🔄 8. Systems Thinking & Leverage Points

**Score: 98/100 | Grade: A+++**

> The new **Leverage Points** section elevates this to a systems-thinking showcase. Interconnected pillars now function like control nodes: knowledge commons, policy harmonization, subsidy shifts.

**✔️ Highlights**: Naming of leverage points, policy coherence logic.
**🛠 Suggestion**: Include a visual system map in future.

---

### 🔐 9. Risk Awareness & Mitigation

**Score: 95/100 | Grade: A++**

> New section is much deeper, covering geopolitical risk, tech centralization, cyber threats, and adaptive fallback models. Highly pragmatic.

**✔️ Highlights**: Decentralized food hubs, cybersecurity audits, green bond scenarios.
**🛠 Suggestion**: Create a shared “Global Risk Heatmap” across frameworks for synergy.

---

### 📢 10. Communication & Advocacy

**Score: 92/100 | Grade: A+**

> Inclusion of **storytelling** and **emotional narratives** is a big upgrade. Emphasizing food heroes, grassroots mobilization, and summit influence shows strong advocacy awareness.

**✔️ Highlights**: Cultural food narratives, summit targeting.
**🛠 Suggestion**: Consider multilingual storytelling platforms or podcast channels.
