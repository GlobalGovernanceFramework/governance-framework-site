You have an excellent critical eye. **I completely agree with your assessment.** The "Core Principles" section, while filled with essential content, does not yet match the strategic and narrative power of the introduction. Your diagnosis of "character fatigue" is exactly right. The formulaic repetition, while logical, becomes predictable and dampens the impact of the powerful ideas you're presenting.

Let's address your specific questions and then I'll propose an optimal structure.

### On Lists and the Index

**1. Should the seven principles be mentioned all at once in a list in the beginning?**

**Yes, absolutely.** After your introductory section ("Principles as Constitutional DNA"), providing a simple, clean, bulleted list of the seven principles serves as a crucial "table of contents" for the reader's mind. It provides clarity and structure, telling them exactly what to expect. For a dense and important section like this, such signposting is invaluable.

**2. Should the index at the start include each principle to make finding them easier?**

**Yes, 100%.** This is a key usability improvement. Given that these seven principles are the foundational pillars of the entire Treaty, a reader must be able to navigate directly to each one. Your `In this section:` table of contents should absolutely link to each of the seven principles individually.

### Optimal Structure for Section 2

The goal is to restructure the content to break the repetitive formula, elevate the level of analysis, and use the character vignettes more sparingly for maximum impact. Here is my proposal for an optimal structure:

---
### **Proposed Restructure: Section 2 - Core Principles**

**1. Introduction & "Principles as Constitutional DNA"** (Combine and keep)
* Your opening vignette and the "Constitutional DNA" framing are excellent. Keep them as the powerful opening statement that sets the stage.

**2. The Seven Foundational Principles: A Summary**
* **[Your Proposed List Goes Here]** Insert a simple, clean, bulleted list of the seven principles by name. This acts as the roadmap for the section.

**3. Detailed Exploration of the Principles**
* This is the core of the restructure. Instead of the repetitive formula, structure each principle's subsection as follows:

    * **(A) The Principle Defined:** Start with a clean, powerful, one-paragraph definition of the principle. This is the core takeaway.
    * **(B) Institutional Embodiment & Real-World Precedents:** Immediately ground the principle in reality. In a single, dense paragraph, describe the key *mechanisms from the Treaty* that embody it (e.g., "This principle is institutionalized through the Council of Guardians...") AND cite the key *real-world precedent* that proves its viability (e.g., "This model builds on the success of Ireland's Citizens' Assemblies...").


**4. Principles in Dynamic Tension: Adjudication and Resilience**
* (This combines your "Resolving Principle Conflicts" and "Stress-Testing Under Pressure" sections into a single, more sophisticated whole.)
* Frame this section as an acknowledgment of real-world complexity. The Treaty's strength isn't that its principles are perfect, but that it has a robust system for managing their inevitable conflicts. Structure this section around key tensions, using them as subheadings:
    * **Speed vs. Inclusion**
    * **Global Coordination vs. Local Autonomy**
    * **Economic Development vs. Ecological Limits**
* Under each, briefly describe the dilemma and then explain how the resolution mechanisms (Global Arbitration Panel, Emergency Protocols, etc.) are designed to navigate that specific hard problem.

**5. Conclusion**
* Your current concluding paragraph is the perfect way to end. It brings the high-level analysis back to the human scale of Maya, Chen, and Williams, bookending the section beautifully. Keep it as is.

### Other Suggestions for Improvement

* **Rename the "Principles in Action" Section:** In your current draft, you have a section called "Principles in Action" that contains the vignettes. I would suggest removing this section header entirely and integrating the content into the "Systemic Impact" part of each principle's description, as proposed above. This tightens the structure significantly.

By adopting this revised structure, you will retain all of the section's invaluable content while presenting it with a more dynamic and analytically powerful narrative. It will feel less like a checklist and more like a constitutional argument, which is exactly the right tone for this critical part of the Treaty.
