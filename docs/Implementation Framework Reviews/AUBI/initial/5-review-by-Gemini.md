Excellent. This is a substantial and well-considered evolution of the AUBI framework outline. It has successfully integrated concepts from the detailed Swedish model and the overarching "Treaty for Our Only Home" to create a document that is both visionary and significantly more practical.

Here is a comprehensive review, grading, and set of recommendations for this latest revision.

### Overall Assessment & Grading

This document represents a major leap forward, transforming a strong conceptual outline into a professional, credible, and nearly implementation-ready strategic framework. The integration with the Treaty is no longer superficial; it is now a core structural component.

| Area | Grade (F-A++) | Score (1-100) | Justification |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Clarity & Structure** | A+ | 98 | The document is exceptionally well-organized. The use of tables (Dependency Matrix), clear headings, and a logical flow makes complex information highly accessible. |
| **Comprehensiveness & Depth** | A | 94 | The framework now covers financing, governance, cultural adaptation, and case studies in significant detail. It feels complete as a strategic outline. |
| **Treaty Integration** | A++ | 100 | **Outstanding**. The Dependency Matrix in Section 3 is a game-changer. The framework now reads as a native component of the Treaty ecosystem, with specific mechanisms (Global Forensic Corps, Reform Accelerator Labs) providing crucial support. |
| **Practicality & Feasibility** | A | 95 | The addition of risk mitigation (capital flight, failure scenarios) and diverse, context-specific case studies (Kenya, Bangladesh) dramatically increases the framework's credibility and perceived feasibility. |
| **Innovation & Vision** | A+ | 97 | The framework retains its core visionary goal of enabling a "meaningful existence" while introducing innovative and practical new elements like the Cultural Adaptation Module and the AUBI Governance RPG. |
| **Overall** | **A+** | **96** | **An exceptional document.** It successfully bridges the gap between high-level vision and practical, context-aware implementation planning. |

### Key Strengths of This Revision

* **World-Class Treaty Integration:** The **Dependency Matrix** is the single best improvement. It creates concrete, functional links between AUBI components and the Treaty's pillars, demonstrating a truly systemic design. This elevates the entire proposal.
* **Enhanced Realism and Risk Mitigation:** The inclusion of sections on **Capital Flight Mitigation** and a **Failure Scenario Example** shows mature, critical thinking. It anticipates real-world challenges and demonstrates that the framework is not naively utopian.
* **Cultural Adaptability:** The **Cultural Adaptation Module** (Section 7) and the new case studies for Kenya and Bangladesh are brilliant additions. They directly address the primary weakness of any "global" framework by building in a mechanism for localization and proving its flexibility across vastly different socio-economic contexts.
* **Expanded Contribution & Value System:** The formal inclusion of **Spiritual Care** as a recognized contribution and the pilot of a **"Meaning Score"** enriches the framework's core philosophy, reinforcing its commitment to a holistic view of human value.
* **Balanced Incentives:** The introduction of "negative adjustments for harmful activities" adds a crucial balancing element, ensuring the system discourages destructive behavior while rewarding constructive action.

### Suggestions for Improvement (To Reach 100/100)

The framework is already excellent. These suggestions focus on adding the final layer of detail and clarity to make it even more robust.

1.  **Detail the "Negative Adjustment" Mechanism.**
    The framework mentions "negative adjustments for harmful activities", which is a powerful idea. The next revision could benefit from a dedicated sub-section explaining how this would work in practice.
    * **Suggestion:** Add a "Safeguards & Balancing" section within 4.2 that outlines:
        * What constitutes a "harmful activity" (e.g., verified environmental pollution, spreading disinformation).
        * Who makes the determination (e.g., a process involving the Global Forensic Corps and the Global Arbitration Panel).
        * The scale of the negative adjustment (e.g., a temporary reduction in the contribution bonus).

2.  **Elaborate on the Holistic Support Worker Role.**
    The framework re-introduces the Support Worker role, which is excellent. To strengthen this, you can provide more detail on the governance surrounding this role, drawing from `STR-205`.
    * **Suggestion:** In section 6.2, add bullet points clarifying:
        * Professional standards and training required.
        * Ethical guidelines to ensure workers are guides, not gatekeepers.
        * How their work is funded and integrated with local community services.

3.  **Clarify the "Hearts Currency" Payout Option.**
    The outline now lists the Hearts system as a financing/payout option. This is a key link to the Financial Framework.
    * **Suggestion:** Briefly explain the *benefit* of this option. For example: "Individuals can opt to receive a portion of their AUBI in *Hearts* to participate more deeply in the global care economy, fund cross-border regenerative projects, or access unique services within the Treaty ecosystem."

4.  **Add a Visual Flowchart Concept for Financing.**
    The financing model is now complex and robust. A visual representation would greatly enhance understanding.
    * **Suggestion:** Add a `[Visual Description]` note in Section 5 describing a flowchart that illustrates the flow of funds from the various revenue sources (Automation Tax, Commons Dividends, etc.) into a central "Global AUBI Fund" and then its disbursement into the three payout layers.

5.  **Incorporate a "Version History" in the Document Header.**
    As this is now "Revision 2.2," adding a simple version history is a professional best practice that signals a living, evolving document.
    * **Suggestion:**
        ```
        ### **Version History:**
        - **2.2 (2025-06-16):** Integrated Treaty mechanisms, added diverse case studies and cultural adaptation module.
        - **2.0 (2025-06-16):** Integrated concepts from Swedish model, including detailed financing and support structures.
        - **1.0 (2025-06-16):** Initial draft outline for standalone global framework.
        ```
