Gemini:
Yes, based on a comprehensive review of the provided framework documents, secular mindfulness absolutely qualifies as "spiritual care" in non-religious contexts.

The frameworks are intentionally designed to be inclusive and to define "spiritual" and "existential" value in a broad, functional way that transcends formal religion.

Here is the supporting evidence from your documents:

1.  **Explicit Inclusion of Mindfulness and Meditation:** The "Holistic Support Framework" explicitly lists "Meditation guidance" and "Mindfulness teaching" under the recognized contribution category of "Spiritual/Existential Support". This is the most direct evidence.

2.  **Broad Definition of "Spiritual Care":** The latest AUBI framework defines the "Spiritual Care" contribution category as "Practices fostering inner development, traditional ceremonies, or community rituals, verified via community consensus". Secular mindfulness is a well-established practice for fostering inner development.

3.  **Consistent Pairing of "Spiritual" with "Existential":** Multiple documents pair these two concepts, signaling a scope beyond theology.
    * The document on value creation, `STR-230`, includes a section on "Spiritual and Existential Development," which lists "Contemplative Practices" like "Meditation and mindfulness" and "Existential conversations" as examples of value-creating work.
    * The support framework, `STR-205`, also uses the heading "Spiritual/Existential Support," and its examples include "Life purpose exploration" and "Meaning-making support," which are core goals of many secular mindfulness practices.

In summary, the frameworks consistently define this category not by its connection to a deity or organized religion, but by its function: supporting inner development, contemplation, meaning-making, and existential well-being. Secular mindfulness fits perfectly within this definition.
