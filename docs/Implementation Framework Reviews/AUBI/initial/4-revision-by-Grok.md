## 1. Executive Summary
- **Vision:** To establish a global social safety net ensuring economic security while rewarding contributions to community wellbeing, ecological health, and personal development, aligned with the "Treaty for Our Only Home."
- **Approach:** AUBI evolves traditional UBI with a dynamic, multi-layered payout system: a universal, locally-adjusted baseline, adaptive bonuses for contributions, and equity-based supplements, integrated with Treaty mechanisms.
- **Goals:** Reduce poverty, validate unpaid care and community work, promote lifelong learning, incentivize ecological stewardship, and foster equitable, resilient societies.
- **Key Features:**
  - Three-tiered payout structure.
  - Diversified financing via automation and resource taxes, supplemented by Commons Dividends and Hearts currency.
  - Optional Holistic Support Framework for personal development.
  - Robust Treaty integration (Global Forensic Corps, Ethical Infrastructure, Reform Accelerator Labs).
  - Cultural Adaptation Module for regional flexibility.
- **Risks:** Potential gaming of contributions, digital divide, and capital flight, mitigated through safeguards, participatory audits, and phased rollouts.

## 2. Introduction: The Philosophy of Adaptive Income
### 2.1. A Foundation for a Meaningful Existence
- AUBI ensures economic security for self-determination, unlocking potential for innovation, community building, and cultural development, aligned with STR-206 (Meaningful Existence as a Social Right).
- Historical inspirations: Alaska Permanent Fund (dividend-based income), Brazil’s Bolsa Família (conditional transfers), and Finland’s UBI pilot (2017-2018), adapted for global scalability.

### 2.2. AUBI vs. Traditional UBI: Key Distinctions
- AUBI integrates with a pluralistic economy and Treaty pillars (P1-P5) for systemic resilience.

| Feature | Traditional UBI | Adaptive UBI (AUBI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payout** | Fixed, flat-rate | Dynamic, multi-layered, locally-adjusted |
| **Conditionality**| Strictly unconditional | Unconditional **baseline**, voluntary adaptive bonuses |
| **Goal** | Economic floor | Floor **and** regenerative activities, meaningful existence |
| **System** | Fiat-based policy | Treaty-integrated, pluralistic economy |

## 3. Treaty Integration: Dependency Matrix
- AUBI leverages Treaty mechanisms for robustness and alignment with global governance.

| **AUBI Component** | **Treaty Pillar** | **Mechanism** |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Financing | P4 (Planetary Health) | Carbon pricing, resource taxes |
| Verification | P2 (Global Forensic Corps) | Fraud prevention, adversarial testing |
| Implementation | P1 (Reform Accelerator Labs) | Pilot testing, iterative improvement |
| Equity & Ethics | P5 (Ethical Infrastructure) | Cultural adaptation, spiritual care recognition |
| Governance | P3 (Humanitarian Stability) | Conflict zone adaptation, participatory audits |

## 4. The AUBI Payout Architecture
Three integrated layers ensure security, contributions, and equity, with safeguards against misuse.

### 4.1. Layer 1: The Universal Baseline
- **Purpose:** Guarantees a basic standard of living for all adults, ensuring dignity.
- **Calculation:**
  - Unconditional for all citizens and permanent residents.
  - Adjusted via regional price indices (housing, food, utilities), updated via Reform Accelerator Labs.
- **Safeguards:** Global Arbitration Panel resolves disputes; AI-Mediated Impact Simulations model inflation risks.

### 4.2. Layer 2: The Contribution & Development Bonus (Adaptive)
- **Purpose:** Recognizes contributions to the commons, including spiritual care work (aligned with P5).
- **Mechanism:** Supplementary amount for verified contributions; negative adjustments for harmful activities (e.g., environmental damage).
- **Recognized Contribution Categories:**
  - **Community & Care:** Service, mentorship, integration.
  - **Environment & Sustainability:** Conservation, sustainable transport.
  - **Knowledge & Culture:** Knowledge sharing, cultural preservation.
  - **Personal & Relational Development:** Mentoring, conflict resolution.
  - **Spiritual Care (New):** Practices fostering inner development, traditional ceremonies, or community rituals, verified via community consensus.
- **Meaning Score Pilot:** Experimental metric for emotional wellbeing contributions, linked to STR-206, tested in AUBI Experimental Zones.
- **Safeguards:**
  - Global Forensic Corps investigates fraud.
  - Office of the Adversary stress-tests verification.
  - Whistleblower protections for misuse reporting.

### 4.3. Layer 3: The Equity & Needs-Based Bonus (Targeted)
- **Purpose:** Addresses systemic inequities and individual needs, especially for marginalized populations.
- **Mechanism:** Supplements based on verified factors:
  - Health conditions and disabilities.
  - Family care responsibilities.
  - Age-related needs.
  - Geographic cost-of-living differences.
- **Inclusivity Enhancements:** Prioritizes low-income regions and conflict zones (aligned with P3), with community-led needs assessments.
- **Safeguards:** Qualitative Participatory Audits ensure fairness.

## 5. Financing and Economic Sustainability
Diversified, Treaty-aligned financing with macroeconomic modeling and capital flight mitigation.

### 5.1. Primary Revenue Sources
1. **Automation Tax:** Progressive tax on AI and automated production.
2. **Resource & Environmental Taxes:** Fees on resource extraction, land value tax, data extraction, carbon pricing (P4).
3. **Financial Transaction Taxes:** Levies on speculation and trading.
4. **Commons Dividends:** Revenue from shared resources (e.g., public data commons).
5. **Hearts Currency System:** Optional payouts in Treaty’s alternative currency.

### 5.2. Systemic Savings
- Reduces costs of welfare systems, healthcare, crime; improves education outcomes.
- **Transition Pathway:** 5-year phase-out of overlapping welfare programs, funded by Reform Impact Bonds.
- **Macroeconomic Modeling:** AI-Mediated Impact Simulations predict inflation and labor market impacts (e.g., 2-3% inflation risk in Year 1, mitigated by phased rollouts).

### 5.3. Capital Flight Mitigation
- Gradual tax implementation with Global Arbitration Panel dispute resolution.
- Incentives for reinvestment in AUBI Experimental Zones.

### 5.4. Failure Scenario Example
- **Scenario:** High inflation (5%) in pilot regions due to rapid AUBI rollout.
- **Response:** Rollback to baseline-only payouts, recalibrate via Reform Accelerator Labs, and adjust taxes using AI simulations.

## 6. Implementation and Governance
### 6.1. Phased Rollout Model
1. **Phase 1: Foundational Pilots (Years 1-2):** Test baseline AUBI in diverse regions (e.g., Sweden, Kenya, Bangladesh), funded by Reform Impact Bonds, tracked by Institutional Resilience Index.
2. **Phase 2: Expansion & Integration (Years 2-4):** Add adaptive and needs-based layers, refine verification with Reform Accelerator Labs.
3. **Phase 3: Full Implementation (Years 5+):** Nationwide rollout, optimized via Annual Global Institutional Reform Summit.

### 6.2. Holistic Support Framework
- **Support Workers:** Guides for personal development and contribution opportunities.
- **AUBI Governance RPG:** Interactive tool for civic education, integrated into Global Competency Framework.

### 6.3. Verification and Validation
- **Digital Systems:** Blockchain and AI for transparency.
- **Societal Validation:** Local review groups, expert panels, citizen observers, with Treaty’s Enforcement pillar anti-corruption measures.
- **Digital Divide Mitigation:** Offline verification and community access points.

### 6.4. Monitoring & Evaluation
- **Institutional Resilience Index:** Tracks performance.
- **Qualitative Participatory Audits:** Community feedback.
- **Transparency Days:** Annual citizen reviews to vote on fairness, feeding into AUBI refinements.
- **Sunset Review Process:** Periodic evaluation for component phase-out, aligned with Treaty.

## 7. Cultural Adaptation Module
- **Purpose:** Ensures AUBI aligns with local values and contexts.
- **Mechanism:** Co-created in AUBI Experimental Zones, involving community leaders to define contribution and equity criteria (e.g., spiritual care in Indigenous contexts).
- **Example:** In Bangladesh, community validation emphasizes women’s cooperatives; in conflict zones, prioritizes humanitarian contributions (aligned with P3).
