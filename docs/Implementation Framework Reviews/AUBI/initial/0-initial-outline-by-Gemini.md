## 1. Executive Summary
- **Vision:** To establish a global social safety net that provides a foundation of economic security while actively recognizing and rewarding contributions to community wellbeing, ecological health, and personal development. This framework moves beyond simple income support to become a tool for enabling meaningful existence and societal resilience.
- **Approach:** AUBI evolves the traditional UBI model by integrating a dynamic, multi-layered payout system. It combines a universal, locally-adjusted baseline with adaptive bonuses tied to participation in the care economy, reparative justice, and other GGF frameworks.
- **Goals:** Reduce poverty and precarity, validate unpaid care and community work, promote lifelong learning, incentivize ecological stewardship, and foster a more resilient and equitable global society.
- **Key Features:** A three-tiered payout structure, a robust and diversified financing model based on automation and resource taxes, and an optional but recommended Holistic Support Framework to guide personal development.

## 2. Introduction: The Philosophy of Adaptive Income
### 2.1. A Foundation for a Meaningful Existence
- The core vision is to create a society where every individual has the freedom and resources to develop according to their own values. AUBI is the primary mechanism to ensure this economic security, which is the foundation for genuine self-determination.
- By freeing people from constant financial stress, AUBI unlocks human potential for innovation, community building, and cultural development that traditional economic frameworks cannot capture.

### 2.2. AUBI vs. Traditional UBI: Key Distinctions
- This framework proposes a significant evolution from a static, unconditional payment to a dynamic, responsive system.

| Feature | Traditional UBI | Adaptive UBI (AUBI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payout** | Fixed, flat-rate | Dynamic, multi-layered, locally-adjusted |
| **Conditionality**| Strictly unconditional | Unconditional **baseline**, with **voluntary** adaptive bonuses |
| **Goal** | Provide economic floor | Provide floor **and** incentivize regenerative activities |
| **System** | Policy within existing fiat system | Integrated module of a new, pluralistic economy |

## 3. The AUBI Payout Architecture
The system is designed with three distinct but integrated layers to ensure security, recognize contribution, and promote equity.

### 3.1. Layer 1: The Universal Baseline
- **Purpose:** To guarantee a basic standard of living for all adults, ensuring real economic freedom and dignity.
- **Calculation:** The base amount is unconditionally provided to all citizens and permanent residents. It is adjusted for local cost of living to ensure it covers essential needs like housing, food, and utilities everywhere.

### 3.2. Layer 2: The Contribution & Development Bonus (Adaptive)
- **Purpose:** To recognize and reward a broad spectrum of voluntary contributions to the commons that are often invisible to the market.
- **Mechanism:** A flexible, supplementary amount based on verified contributions.
- **Recognized Contribution Categories:**
    - **Community & Care:** Community service, care work, mentorship, and integration activities.
    - **Environment & Sustainability:** Environmental conservation, local food production, and sustainable transport initiatives.
    - **Knowledge & Culture:** Knowledge sharing, cultural preservation, artistic creation, and alternative learning initiatives.
    - **Personal & Relational Development:** Mentoring, conflict resolution support, and facilitating support groups.

### 3.3. Layer 3: The Equity & Needs-Based Bonus (Targeted)
- **Purpose:** To proactively address systemic inequities and provide additional support based on individual circumstances.
- **Mechanism:** A targeted supplement based on verified, needs-based factors.
- **Individual Adjustment Factors:**
    - Health conditions and disabilities.
    - Responsibilities for caring for family members.
    - Age-related needs.
    - Significant geographic cost-of-living differences.

## 4. Financing and Economic Sustainability
AUBI's financing is designed to be robust, diversified, and integrated with a new economic paradigm.

### 4.1. Primary Revenue Sources
1.  **Automation Tax:** A progressive tax on automated production and AI systems to redistribute technological productivity gains back to society.
2.  **Resource & Environmental Taxes:** Fees on the extraction and use of natural resources, a land value tax, a data extraction tax, and carbon pricing.
3.  **Financial Transaction Taxes:** Small levies on financial market speculation, currency trading, and other high-frequency transactions.

### 4.2. Systemic Savings
- The implementation of AUBI is projected to generate significant savings in other areas by reducing the need for complex, bureaucratic welfare systems and by proactively addressing the root causes of social problems.
- **Indirect Savings Include:** Reduced healthcare costs from lower stress levels, reduced crime, and improved educational outcomes.

## 5. Implementation and Governance
### 5.1. Phased Rollout Model
A gradual, evidence-based implementation is crucial for success.
1.  **Phase 1: Foundational Pilots (Years 1-2):** Establish technical infrastructure and pilot the baseline AUBI in a few diverse municipalities to gather data and validate effects.
2.  **Phase 2: Expansion & Integration (Years 2-4):** Expand to more regions and begin integrating the adaptive contribution and needs-based layers. Develop and refine verification systems for societal contributions.
3.  **Phase 3: Full Implementation (Years 5+):** Nationwide rollout with a fully integrated system, advanced data analysis, and continuous optimization.

### 5.2. Holistic Support Framework (Optional but Recommended)
- To maximize the potential of AUBI, a network of "Support Workers" can be established.
- **Core Function:** These workers act as guides, helping individuals navigate personal development, identify contribution opportunities, and connect with community resources. This adds a crucial human support layer to the financial system.

### 5.3. Verification and Validation
- A hybrid system combining technology and community is used to verify contributions.
- **Digital Systems:** Blockchain-based tracking and AI-supported validation can provide transparent and secure records.
- **Societal Validation:** Local review groups, expert panels, and citizen observers ensure that the validation process is grounded in community values and context.

## 6. Case Study: The Swedish AUBI Model
This section illustrates how the global AUBI framework can be adapted to a specific national context, using the detailed Swedish model as an example.

- **Specifics of the Model:**
    - **AUBI as Taxable Income:** In the Swedish proposal, the AUBI base amount of 15,000 SEK is treated as taxable income, integrating it directly into the existing progressive tax structure. This ensures the system is partially self-financing through tax returns.
    - **Contribution as Tax Reduction:** Rather than a direct "bonus" payout, societal contributions are recognized through a tax reduction or "subsidy" system. For example, an IT developer contributing to open-source projects could see her effective tax rate decrease from 32% to 28%.
    - **Leveraging National Infrastructure:** The model relies heavily on existing Swedish digital infrastructure like `BankID` for secure identity verification, demonstrating the principle of using established local systems.
    - **Targeted Legal Reforms:** Implementation requires specific amendments to Swedish laws like `Socialförsäkringsbalken` (Social Insurance Code) and `Plan- och bygglagen` (Planning and Building Act), showing the kind of targeted legal work necessary in any country.

This case study demonstrates the framework's adaptability, showing how core principles can be implemented through different mechanisms tailored to a nation's legal, social, and technological landscape.
