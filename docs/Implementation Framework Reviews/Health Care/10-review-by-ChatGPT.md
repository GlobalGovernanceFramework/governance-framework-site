## üå± Suggestions (Minor Enhancements)

These are bonus ideas‚Äîyou're already at the summit, but could add polish:

Create a parallel movement of **creatives, illustrators, and musicians** to produce content, murals, songs, and art installations about the Accord.

### 2. **Children‚Äôs Edition of the Planetary Health Accord**

Distill the framework into a children‚Äôs book or educational comic‚Äîbuilding health citizenship from youth.

### 3. **Planetary Health Accord Index (PHAI)**

Establish an annual **index of framework adoption and equity**, similar to the SDG Index, with country rankings, dashboards, and summaries.

### 4. **Honorary Role of Planetary Health Stewards**

Designate annual **Planetary Health Stewards** (from youth, indigenous communities, healthcare workers) to elevate voices and inspire participation.

### 5. **Global Health Peace Medals**

Award individuals and communities who demonstrate heroic efforts in planetary health under crisis‚Äîblending visibility with dignity.
