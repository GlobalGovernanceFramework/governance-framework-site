# Global Existential Risk Governance (GERG) Framework  
*(The WHO for Existential Risks: Final Revised Outline)*  

## 1. Scope of Governance  
The GERG framework, branded as **"The WHO for Existential Risks"**, addresses **actionable, evidence-based existential risks** with plausible pathways to global catastrophe. Risks must meet:  
- **Material or Causal Evidence**: Supported by empirical data or causal models (e.g., historical precedents, scientific projections).  
- **Capacity for Human Intervention**: Viable prevention, mitigation, or resilience strategies exist.  

**Risk Tiers**:  
- **Tier 1 (High Priority)**: Immediate, actionable risks with high likelihood/severity (e.g., AI misalignment, nuclear warfare).  
- **Tier 2 (Medium Priority)**: Emerging risks with partial intervenability (e.g., quantum warfare, nanotech gray goo).  
- **Tier 3 (Low Priority)**: Philosophical or unactionable risks (e.g., simulation shutdown, false vacuum decay).  

**Excluded from Active Governance (Tier 3)**: Monitored via horizon scanning for potential reclassification if new evidence emerges.  
- **Simulation shutdown** (see Section 2).  
- **Theological/afterlife risks** (unfalsifiable).  
- **False vacuum decay** (no causal link to human activity).  
- **Rogue black holes** (speculative, non-intervenable).  

**Risk-Assessment Flowchart for Tier Reclassification**:  
1. **Evidence Check**: Is there empirical data or a causal model? (Yes → Proceed; No → Tier 3)  
2. **Intervenability Check**: Are prevention/mitigation strategies feasible? (Yes → Tier 1/2; No → Tier 3)  
3. **Impact Assessment**: Quantify likelihood (e.g., >1% in 50 years) and severity (e.g., >50% population loss).  
4. **Review Cycle**: Annual ERO reassessment for tier adjustments.

## 2. Simulation Theory: Pragmatic Deprioritization  
**Rationale for Tier 3 Classification**:  
- **Non-Intervenability**: No known mechanism exists to influence a hypothetical simulation shutdown (quantified as 0% actionable control).  
- **Non-Verifiability**: Lacks empirical testability or falsifiable predictions.  
- **Pluralistic Respect**: GERG respects diverse worldviews (materialist, idealist, simulationist) but prioritizes shared, evidence-based action thresholds.  

**Statement**:  
*"Simulation theory, while a compelling academic exercise, is deprioritized in GERG due to its non-intervenable and unverifiable nature. GERG focuses on risks where human agency can reduce suffering or prevent catastrophe, without requiring metaphysical consensus."*  

**Footnote**: For academic exploration of consciousness-first models, see [Appendix A](#appendix-a) or [globalgovernanceframework.org/philosophy]. These are not GERG policy positions.

- **Global Knowledge Vaults**: Digital/physical backups (e.g., Svalbard 2.0).  
- **Post-Collapse Continuity**: Underground/off-world "arks" with **equity-based access frameworks** (e.g., lottery systems prioritizing vulnerable populations, overseen by ethics board).  
- **Psychological Resilience**: **Citizen Resilience Program** (e.g., Iceland-style emergency drills) to train communities in crisis adaptation.  
- **Regional Disparities**: Prioritize resilience funding for climate-vulnerable and low-resource regions.  

## 6. Worldview-Sensitive Adaptation Layer  
To accommodate diverse epistemologies:  
- **Non-Attachment to Outcomes**: Reduces crisis paralysis, inspired by consciousness-centric frameworks.  
- **Compassion-Driven Governance**: Ethical action rooted in shared humanity.  
- **Indigenous Knowledge Integration**: Incorporate holistic risk perspectives (e.g., **Māori climate adaptation models** using kaitiakitanga principles).  
- **Metaphor for Unity**: *"Whether reality is a simulation, a dream, or a cosmic accident, the pain of a starving child is real enough to demand action."*

## 7. Implementation Roadmap  
- **Phase 1 (2026-2028)**:  
  - Establish ERO, UN-ESC, Global South Advisory Council; ratify AI Safety Accord and Biosecurity Pact within **12 months**.  
  - Launch Existential Civics for ages 12+ in 50% of UN member states.  
  - Pilot citizen resilience programs in 10 countries (e.g., Iceland, Kenya).  
- **Phase 2 (2028-2035)**:  
  - Deploy decentralized infrastructure; expand Spaceguard 2.0.

## 8. Notes for Further Development  
- **Policy Language**: Tailored for **globalgovernanceframework.org**, emphasizing clarity, coalition-building, and urgency.  
- **Experiential Tools**: Develop simulation-based training (e.g., risk scenario exercises) with **Taoist Dwarf Fortress** as an easter egg in staff modules for engagement.  
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Conduct global consultations with Indigenous communities, regional governments, and youth groups.  
- **Ethical Oversight**: Establish an **Ethics Board** to address dilemmas in resilience resource allocation (e.g., ark access).  
- **UN Reform**: Propose **UN Security Council veto power** for existential risk resolutions to ensure enforcement.  

## Appendix A: Consciousness and Governance  
For academic exploration of consciousness-first models, GERG acknowledges their ethical inspiration without endorsing as policy. See [globalgovernanceframework.org/philosophy].

## Appendix B: Model Treaty Article for UN-ESC  
**Article 1: Enforcement Powers**  
1. The Existential Security Council (UN-ESC) is authorized to issue binding resolutions on existential risks, including moratoriums on high-risk technologies (e.g., unaligned AGI, gain-of-function research).  
2. Member states shall comply with resolutions, enforceable via economic sanctions, asset freezes, or targeted interventions by Global Response Teams.  
3. Non-compliance triggers automatic UN Security Council review, with veto power granted to UN-ESC for existential risk matters.  
4. Funding via sin tax on high-risk technologies (e.g., 1% tax on AI compute >10^18 FLOPS, synthetic biology equipment).

This framework is **pragmatic**, **equitable**, and **enforceable**, designed to unite diverse stakeholders in preventing and surviving existential risks. It balances urgency with inclusivity, ensuring global coordination and resilience for all regions.
