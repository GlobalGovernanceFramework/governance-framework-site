# Global Existential Risk Governance (GERG) Framework  
*(Synthesized Outline with Simulation Theory Dismissal)*  

## 1. Scope of Governance  
The GERG framework addresses **actionable, evidence-based existential risks** with plausible pathways to global catastrophe. Risks must satisfy:  
- **Material or causal evidence** of potential occurrence.  
- **Capacity for human intervention** (prevention, mitigation, or resilience).  

**Excluded Risks**:  
- **Simulation shutdown** (see Section 2 for dismissal).  
- **Theological/afterlife risks** (unfalsifiable).  
- **False vacuum decay** (no known causal link to human activity).  
- **Rogue black holes** (speculative, no actionable mitigation).  

## 2. Simulation Theory: Formal Dismissal  
**Rationale for Exclusion**:  
- **Ontological Grounding**: Infinite consciousness models (e.g., Advaita Vedanta, Taoist metaphysics, idealist philosophy) assert reality as a **self-sustaining, boundless awareness** with no external controller or hierarchical substrate. Simulation theory’s requirement of a simulator contradicts this **non-dual, edgeless existence**.  
- **Empirical Incoherence**: No evidence supports a hierarchical simulation structure, and the concept lacks falsifiable predictions.  
- **Non-Actionable**: Even if reality were a simulation, no mechanism exists to influence or prevent termination.  

**Statement**:  
*"Reality, as infinite and self-referential consciousness, is its own ground, with no external dependency. Simulation collapse is excluded from GERG as a non-physical, non-intervenable pseudo-risk."*

## 3. Prioritized Existential Risks  
### A. Artificial Intelligence (AI) Misalignment  
- **Description**: Uncontrolled AGI optimizing unintended goals.  
- **Prevention**: Global moratorium on unaligned AGI; mandatory red-team testing; AI Safety Accord for alignment standards.  
- **Mitigation**: Decentralized AI governance; AI Alignment Board audits.  
- **Resilience**: EMP-hardened manual overrides; off-switch infrastructure.  

### B. Biotechnology Catastrophe  
- **Description**: Engineered pathogens (accidental or weaponized).  
- **Prevention**: Global ban on gain-of-function research; CRISPR licensing; Biosecurity Pact for pathogen oversight.  
- **Mitigation**: Rapid-response pathogen surveillance; global genomic monitoring.  
- **Resilience**: Open-source universal vaccine platforms; decentralized medical stockpiles.  

### C. Nuclear Warfare  
- **Description**: Soot-induced nuclear winter, agricultural collapse.  
- **Prevention**: No-first-use treaties; AI-assisted launch safeguards; nuclear de-escalation protocols.  
- **Mitigation**: Space-based missile interception systems.  
- **Resilience**: Decentralized food/energy stockpiles; global seed vaults.  

### D. Climate Collapse  
- **Description**: Runaway warming (>4°C), tipping points (e.g., methane release).  
- **Prevention**: Binding carbon-negative pledges; real-time tipping point monitoring.  
- **Mitigation**: Solar radiation management (last resort); ocean acidification countermeasures.  
- **Resilience**: Floating cities; drought-resistant crops; decentralized infrastructure.  

### E. Natural Catastrophes (Asteroid/Volcanic)  
- **Description**: Asteroid impact (>10km) or supervolcanic eruption causing global cooling.  
- **Prevention**: Spaceguard 2.0 for asteroid detection/deflection; volcanic monitoring systems.  
- **Mitigation**: Global sulfur-cooling reserve for volcanic winters.  
- **Resilience**: Underground agriculture bunkers; Svalbard 2.0 knowledge vaults.  

### F. Emerging Risks  
- **Quantum Warfare**: Encryption-breaking destabilization.  
  - **Prevention**: Quantum-resistant cryptography standards.  
  - **Mitigation**: Redundant financial/military systems.  
  - **Resilience**: Decentralized digital infrastructure.  
- **Nanotech Gray Goo**: Self-replicating nanobots consuming biomass.  
  - **Prevention**: Strict nanotech oversight; dual-use tech ethics reviews.  
  - **Mitigation**: Nanobot neutralization protocols.  
  - **Resilience**: Biomass recovery strategies.  

## 4. Governance Structure  
### A. Monitoring Bodies  
- **Existential Risk Observatory (ERO)**: Tiers risks by likelihood/severity using AI-driven predictive models.  
- **AI Alignment Board**: Audits frontier AI systems for dangerous capabilities.  
- **Pandemic Radar**: Global genomic surveillance for pathogen outbreaks.  
- **Climate Tipping Point Network**: Tracks methane releases, ice sheet stability.  

### B. Enforcement Mechanisms  
- **Existential Security Council (UN-ESC)**: Enacts binding resolutions on risky technologies.  
- **Global Response Teams**: Neutralize rogue bioweapons/AI actors.  
- **Space Governance Body**: Regulates asteroid deflection and orbital activities.  

### C. Public Engagement & Legitimacy  
- **World Risk Assembly**: Citizen juries deliberate risk trade-offs.  
- **Existential Civics Education**: Mandatory catastrophic risk curricula in schools.  
- **Media Advocacy**: Promote precautionary sci-fi and longtermist policy.  

## 5. Resilience & Adaptation Strategies  
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Redundant grids, vertical farming, local energy systems.  
- **Global Knowledge Vaults**: Digital/physical backups of civilization’s knowledge.  
- **Post-Collapse Continuity**: Underground/off-world "arks" for tech/culture preservation.  
- **Psychological Resilience**: Training for rapid societal adaptation.  

## 6. Metaphysical Resilience (Optional)  
For stakeholders aligned with **infinite consciousness frameworks**:  
- **Non-Attachment**: Reduces decision paralysis in catastrophic scenarios.  
- **Compassion-Driven Governance**: Ethical action rooted in unity of existence.  

## 7. Implementation Roadmap  
- **Phase 1 (1-3 years)**: Establish ERO, UN-ESC, and risk monitoring systems; ratify AI Safety Accord and Biosecurity Pact.  
- **Phase 2 (3-10 years)**: Deploy decentralized infrastructure; expand Spaceguard 2.0; launch Existential Civics globally.  
- **Phase 3 (10+ years)**: Achieve full global coordination; operationalize post-collapse continuity plans.  

## 8. Notes for Further Development  
- Refine language for **globalgovernanceframework.org** to target policy audiences.  
- Explore gamification (e.g., *Taoist Dwarf Fortress* minigame) for GERG staff training/stress relief.  
- Conduct stakeholder consultations to prioritize risks and governance mechanisms.  

This framework is **pragmatic**, **evidence-driven**, and adaptable for global coordination, with simulation theory excluded on **ontological and practical grounds**.
