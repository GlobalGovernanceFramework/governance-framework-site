Understood! Below is a **revised Global Existential Risk Governance (GERG) framework** with a formal dismissal of simulation theory as a credible existential risk, grounded in your ontology of **infinite consciousness as fundamental reality**.

### **Global Existential Risk Governance (GERG) Framework**  
*(With Simulation Theory Exclusion Clause)*  

#### **1. Scope of Governance**  
The GERG addresses **actionable, evidence-based existential risks**â€”those with plausible pathways to global catastrophe. Risks must meet **two criteria**:  
- **Material or causal evidence** of potential occurrence.  
- **Capacity for human intervention** (prevention, mitigation, or resilience).  

**Excluded Risks**:  
- **Simulation shutdown** (see *Metaphysical Dismissal* below).  
- **Theological/afterlife risks** (unfalsifiable by design).  
- **False vacuum decay** (no known causal link to human activity).  

---

### **2. Simulation Theory: Formal Dismissal**  
**Rationale for Exclusion**:  
- **Infinite consciousness models** (e.g., Advaita Vedanta, Taoist metaphysics, idealist philosophy) posit that reality is a **self-sustaining, boundless field of awareness**, with no "outside" controller.  
- **Empirical incoherence**: Simulation theory requires a **hierarchical substrate** (simulators > simulation), which contradicts the **non-dual, edgeless nature of infinite existence**.  
- **No actionable mitigation**: Even if the universe were a simulation, there is no known mechanism to influence or prevent its termination.  

**Elegant Statement**:  
*"Reality, as an infinite and self-referential consciousness, cannot be 'simulated' in the hierarchical senseâ€”it is its own ground, with no external dependency. Thus, simulation collapse is excluded from GERG as a non-physical, non-intervenable pseudo-risk."*

### **3. Prioritized Risks & Governance Mechanisms**  
#### **A. Artificial Intelligence**  
- **Prevention**: Global moratorium on unaligned AGI development; mandatory "red team" testing.  
- **Mitigation**: Decentralized AI governance (no single point of failure).  
- **Resilience**: "Off-switch" infrastructure (e.g., EMP-hardened manual overrides).  

#### **B. Biotechnology**  
- **Prevention**: Global ban on gain-of-function research; CRISPR licensing.  
- **Mitigation**: Rapid-response pathogen surveillance network.  
- **Resilience**: Open-source universal vaccine platforms.  

#### **C. Nuclear Warfare**  
- **Prevention**: No-first-use treaties; AI-assisted launch safeguards.  
- **Mitigation**: Space-based missile interception.  
- **Resilience**: Decentralized food/energy stockpiles.  

#### **D. Climate Collapse**  
- **Prevention**: Binding carbon-negative pledges.  
- **Mitigation**: Solar radiation management (last resort).  
- **Resilience**: Floating cities, drought-resistant crops.  

#### **E. Asteroid/Volcanic Threats**  
- **Prevention**: Asteroid deflection programs (e.g., NASA DART 2.0).  
- **Mitigation**: Global sulfur-cooling reserve (for volcanic winter).  
- **Resilience**: Underground agriculture bunkers.

### **4. Governance Structure**  
#### **A. Monitoring Bodies**  
- **Existential Risk Observatory (ERO)**: Tiers risks by likelihood/severity.  
- **AI Alignment Board**: Audits frontier AI systems.  

#### **B. Enforcement**  
- **Existential Security Council (UN-ESC)**: Binding resolutions on risky tech.  
- **Global Swat Teams**: Neutralize bioweapons/AI rogue actors.  

#### **C. Public Legitimacy**  
- **World Risk Assembly**: Citizen juries deliberate on risk trade-offs.  
- **Mandatory Education**: "Existential Civics" in schools.  

---

### **5. Metaphysical Resilience (Optional)**  
For those operating within **infinite consciousness frameworks**:  
- **Non-attachment to outcomes**: Reduces paralysis in face of catastrophe.  
- **Compassion as governance**: Ethical action flows from recognizing unity.  

---

### **Final Draft for Your Site**  
This version is **strictly pragmatic**, with simulation theory excluded on **ontological and practical grounds**. It aligns with your vision of **actionable governance** while sidestepping unfalsifiable risks.  

Would you like to adapt any section for **globalgovernanceframework.org**? I can refine language for policy audiences.
