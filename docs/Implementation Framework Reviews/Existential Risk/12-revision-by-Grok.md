# Global Existential Risk Governance (GERG) Framework  
*(The IPCC for All Existential Risks: Final Enhanced Outline)*  

## 1. Scope of Governance  
The GERG framework, branded as **"The IPCC for All Existential Risks"**, addresses **actionable, evidence-based existential risks** with plausible pathways to global catastrophe. Risks must meet:  
- **Material or Causal Evidence**: Supported by empirical data or causal models (e.g., historical precedents, scientific projections).  
- **Capacity for Human Intervention**: Viable prevention, mitigation, or resilience strategies exist.  

**Risk Tiers**:  
- **Tier 0 (Compound Risk Clusters)**: Systemic entanglements of multiple Tier 1/2 risks (e.g., AI-biotech-epistemic failure convergence).  
- **Tier 1 (High Priority)**: Immediate, actionable risks with high likelihood/severity (e.g., AI misalignment, nuclear warfare).  
- **Tier 2 (Medium Priority)**: Emerging risks with partial intervenability (e.g., quantum warfare, self-replicating nanotech).  
- **Tier 3 (Watchlist)**: Philosophical or unactionable risks (e.g., simulation shutdown, false vacuum decay).  

**Watchlist Risks (Tier 3)**: Monitored via horizon scanning for reclassification if new evidence emerges.  
- **Simulation shutdown** (see Section 2).  
- **Theological/afterlife risks** (unfalsifiable).  
- **False vacuum decay** (no causal link to human activity).  
- **Rogue black holes** (speculative, non-intervenable).  

**Risk-Assessment Flowchart for Tier Reclassification**:  
1. **Evidence Check**: Is there empirical data or a causal model? (Yes → Proceed; No → Tier 3)  
2. **Intervenability Check**: Are prevention/mitigation strategies feasible? (Yes → Tier 0/1/2; No → Tier 3)  
3. **Impact Assessment**: Quantify likelihood (e.g., >1% in 50 years) and severity (e.g., >50% population loss).  
4. **Public Petitioning**: Academic/civil society petitions for reclassification, reviewed annually by ERO.  

**Public Dashboard**: Real-time risk-tier updates on **globalgovernanceframework.org/dashboard**, with transparent likelihood/severity metrics.  
**Mobile GERG Risk App**: Visualizes personal/regional exposure and resilience based on dashboard inputs, launched in Phase 1.

## 2. Simulation Theory: Pragmatic Deprioritization  
**Rationale for Tier 3 Classification**:  
- **Non-Intervenability**: No known mechanism exists to influence a hypothetical simulation shutdown (quantified as 0% actionable control).  
- **Non-Verifiability**: Lacks empirical testability or falsifiable predictions.  
- **Soft Epistemic Risk**: Simulation-induced nihilism or apathy may undermine societal resilience, addressed via existential education (Section 3.F).  
- **Pluralistic Respect**: GERG respects diverse worldviews (materialist, idealist, simulationist) but prioritizes shared, evidence-based action thresholds.  

**Statement**:  
*"Simulation theory, while a compelling academic exercise, is deprioritized in GERG due to its non-intervenable and unverifiable nature. GERG focuses on risks where human agency can reduce suffering or prevent catastrophe, without requiring metaphysical consensus. Potential epistemic risks, such as simulation-induced nihilism, are addressed through education and resilience strategies."*  

**Footnote**: For academic exploration of consciousness-first models or other metaphysical frameworks, see [Appendix A](#appendix-a) or [globalgovernanceframework.org/philosophy]. These are not GERG policy positions.

- **Climate Tipping Point Network**: Tracks methane releases, ice sheet stability.  

### B. Enforcement Mechanisms  
- **Existential Security Council (UN-ESC)**: UNSC sub-body with **veto power for existential risk resolutions**; enacts binding resolutions via **Model Treaty Article** (Appendix B). For non-existential overlaps (e.g., nuclear conflicts below extinction threshold), UN-ESC defers to UNSC with joint consultation protocols.  
- **Global Response Teams**: Operate under UN-ESC with Interpol-like jurisdiction; overseen by **Independent Oversight Tribunal** with civil society judges.  
- **Space Governance Body**: Regulates asteroid deflection and orbital activities.  
- **Network-Based Governance Nodes**: Regional/local actors coordinate with global bodies.  
- **Sin Tax on Existential Risk**: 1% tax on high-risk tech (e.g., AI compute >10^18 FLOPS, synthetic biology equipment).  
- **Existential Risk Sanctions**: Non-compliant corporations face patent revocation or trade restrictions.  
- **Transitional Governance Track**: **Coalition of the Willing** (>20 nations, >25% global GDP or >20% population) pilots GERG mechanisms; **observer status** for non-signatory states to encourage adoption.  

### C. Public Engagement & Legitimacy  
- **World Risk Assembly**: Citizen juries with diverse representation (Global South, Indigenous, youth) deliberate risk trade-offs.  
- **Existential Civics Education**: Mandatory curricula for ages 12+, localized in 10+ languages by 2028.  
- **Media Advocacy**: Promote precautionary sci-fi and longtermist policies via entertainment.  
- **Civil Society Watchdogs**: Grassroots organizations monitor governance efficacy.  
- **Global South Advisory Council**: Ensures equitable representation in planning and resource allocation.  
- **Interactive Treaty Builder Tool**: Online sandbox on **globalgovernanceframework.org** for NGOs/nations to draft mock treaties.  
- **Mobile GERG Risk App**: Empowers public with real-time risk exposure and resilience data.  

## 5. Resilience & Adaptation Strategies  
- **Decentralized Infrastructure**: Redundant grids, vertical farming, local energy systems.  
- **Global Knowledge Vaults**: Digital/physical backups (Svalbard 2.0); digital continuity protocols; **cultural resilience preservation** (e.g., Indigenous languages, spiritual traditions, music).  
- **Post-Collapse Continuity**: Underground/off-world "arks" with **equity-based access frameworks** (lottery systems prioritizing vulnerable populations, overseen by Ethics Board).  
- **Psychological Resilience**: **Citizen Resilience Program** (Iceland-style drills) with **WHO Mental Health** partnership for trauma-informed training; includes **cultural and psychosocial resilience frameworks** to prevent meaning collapse.  
- **Resilience Audits**: Annual national/corporate scorecards assessing preparedness (e.g., infrastructure redundancy, food security).  
- **Priority Resilience Zones**: Low-lying coastal cities, drought-prone regions, climate-vulnerable islands (e.g., Maldives, Kiribati).  

## 6. Worldview-Sensitive Adaptation Layer  
To accommodate diverse epistemologies:  
- **Non-Attachment to Outcomes**: Reduces crisis paralysis, inspired by consciousness-centric frameworks.  
- **Compassion-Driven Governance**: Ethical action rooted in shared humanity.  
- **Indigenous Knowledge Integration**: Incorporate holistic perspectives (e.g., Māori kaitiakitanga, Islamic khilafah, African ubuntu, Confucian harmony).  
- **Stewardship Certification**: Policies meeting Indigenous criteria (e.g., ecological balance, intergenerational equity) receive certification.  
- **Cross-Stage Developmental Models**: Educational interfaces using frameworks like Spiral Dynamics or Kohlberg’s moral development to support worldview maturity.  
- **Metaphor for Unity**: *"Whether reality is a simulation, a dream, or a cosmic accident, the pain of a starving child is real enough to demand action."*

## 7. Implementation Roadmap  
- **Phase 1 (2026-2028)**:  
  - Establish ERO, UN-ESC, Global South Advisory Council; ratify AI Safety Accord and Biosecurity Pact within **12 months**.  
  - Launch Existential Civics in 50% of UN member states (ages 12+, 10+ languages).  
  - Pilot Citizen Resilience Program in 10 countries (e.g., Iceland, Kenya).  
  - Initiate Coalition of the Willing (>20 nations, >25% GDP or >20% population).  
  - Fund policy infrastructure in low-resource nations.  
  - Publish **Year 1 Scorecard** (e.g., "10+ nations adopt sin tax by 2027").  
  - Launch **Mobile GERG Risk App** and **Gerghub** pilot cities (e.g., Singapore, Reykjavik, Nairobi).  
- **Phase 2 (2028-2035)**:  
  - Deploy decentralized infrastructure; expand Spaceguard 2.0.  
  - Operationalize World Risk Assembly (100+ countries).  
  - Implement sin tax and sanctions on non-compliant corporations.  
- **Phase 3 (2035+)**:  
  - Achieve global coordination; refine equity protocols for arks.  
  - Scale resilience programs globally.  
- **Adaptive Governance**: Annual foresight workshops/Delphi panels; **KPIs** (e.g., 80% treaty adoption by 2030, **100M trained in Existential Civics by 2030**, 50% reduction in unaligned AI projects by 2035).  
- **Fallback Plan**: If treaty adoption lags, pivot to **resilience-first track** prioritizing **Tier 1 Resilience Regions** (e.g., Maldives, Sub-Saharan Africa, Bangladesh) with decentralized infrastructure and local coalitions.
