# Work in Liberation: A Transformative Labour & Employment Governance Framework

## Executive Summary: A Day in the Life, 2045
In 2045, in a Tanzanian **Local Zone**, you wake secure—your **Care Bonus Pay** of $1,200/month, boosted 20% for mentoring youth, plus a **Dignity Baseline** (free housing, food, healthcare), ensures freedom from survival worries. Using a **Community Work App** or paper board, you join a **Community Work Team** to restore a watershed, earning **Care Credits** for local goods, with currency stability tested in pilot communities. Your **Flexible Time** schedule respects your needs, and a **Shorter Workweek** (15-hour cap) leaves time for creativity. At a **Community Renewal** ceremony, youth and elders share stories, celebrating your team’s **Green Job Score**, validated by community oversight with rapid anti-elite capture responses. **Work With Purpose**—care, creativity, planet health—replaces exploitation, guided by the **Fractal Labor Parliament** and **Tech That Helps**, certified for quality and climate-resilient. By 2045, 50% of people live this way, with 30% of jobs regenerating ecosystems, supported by international coordination. *Work in Liberation* starts small, adapts via community ownership, and builds a post-growth future.

## Introduction: A Post-Growth Vision for Work
**Vision**: *"From exploited work to meaningful contributions—where care, creativity, and planet health redefine work, fully decoupled from survival, in harmony with ecological boundaries."*

This framework creates **Work With Purpose** through **Care Bonus Pay**<sup>1</sup>, **Community Work Teams**, and **Shorter Workweeks**, integrating **disability justice** (filename: 11-revision-by-Grok.md), **Indigenous wisdom** (filename: 22-revision-by-Grok.md), **elder contributions** (filename: 13-revision-by-Claude.md), **post-work innovations** (filename: 2-further-ideas-from-Björn-Kenenth-and-lang.md), and youth engagement. It uses low-tech options, community ownership, and a 20-year plan with robust resilience, quality assurance, anti-elite capture mechanisms, and international coordination.

## 1. Core Principles
1. **Work as Planetary Contribution**  
   - Redefine work as **care, creativity, planet health**, valued via **Care Credits** (Financial Systems Framework, Section 3).  
   - **Post-Growth Labor Doctrine**: Prioritize Gross Planetary Health over GDP, with plain language explainers (DeepSeek, Section 1; Claude-3, Section 1).  

2. **Freedom from Survival Work**  
   - **Right to refuse** unfair tasks, with **Flexible Time** (Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 2).  
   - **Dignity Baseline**: Unconditional housing, food, healthcare (DeepSeek, Section 3).  
   - **Contribution Ceilings**: Max 15 hours/week required work by 2035 (DeepSeek, Section 3).  

3. **Fair, Plural Rewards**  
   - Combine cash, **Care Credits**, **Eco Credits** (Financial Systems Framework, Section 5) (60% cash, 40% credits).  
   - Use Indigenous *ayni* for shared work, with knowledge protection enforcement (Financial Systems Framework, Section 1.1; Claude-3, Section 5; Claude-4, Section 6).
