# Work in Liberation: A Simplified Labour & Employment Governance Framework

## Executive Summary: A Day in the Life, 2045
Picture 2045 in a rural Kenyan Bioregional Autonomy Zone (BAZ). You wake up free from the pressure of earning a living—your **Bonus Income for Caregiving (AUBI)** of $1,000/month covers essentials, with a 20% bonus for caring for your elderly neighbor. You use a simple **Community Work App** on your phone to join a **Community Work Team** planting trees, earning **Care Credits (*Hearts*)** you swap for local produce. Your schedule, shaped by **Flexible Time** for accessibility, lets you rest when needed. Later, you attend a community meeting to plan a **Shorter Workweek Pilot**, celebrating with storytelling and music. This is **Purpose-Driven Work**: no exploitation, just care and community, guided by local councils and ethical tech. By 2045, 50% of people live this way, with 30% of jobs healing the planet. *Work in Liberation* starts small, grows steadily, and transforms work into a source of dignity and connection.

**Visual Aid**:  
- **Description**: A spiral infographic showing:  
  - **Inner Ring**: "Survival Work" (exploitation).  
  - **Middle Ring**: "Empowered Work" (Bonus Income, Care Credits).  
  - **Outer Ring**: "Purpose-Driven Work" (community, planet).  
- **Implementation**: Interactive at `workinliberation.org/spiral` (Q2 2027), with a thumbnail mockup (color-coded rings, care/planet icons).

## Introduction: A Practical Path to Liberated Work
**Vision**: *"From exploited work to liberated contributions—where every act honors dignity, builds community, and heals the planet, starting with practical steps toward a fairer future."*

This framework transforms work into **Purpose-Driven Work**, focusing on care, community, and ecological healing. It simplifies the original vision, prioritizing **Bonus Income for Caregiving (AUBI)**, **Care Credit Systems**, **Shorter Workweeks**, and **Community Work Teams**. It integrates **disability justice** (Radical Disability Rights Framework, filename: 11-revision-by-Grok.md), **Indigenous wisdom** (Financial Systems Framework, filename: 22-revision-by-Grok.md), **elder contributions** (Aging Population Support Framework, filename: 13-revision-by-Claude.md), and **post-work principles** (filename: 2-further-ideas-from-Björn-Kenenth-Holmström-and-DeepSeek.md), using low-tech options and incremental steps to ensure feasibility.

**System Map**:  
- **Description**: A one-page diagram linking **Care Credits (*Hearts*)**, **Bonus Income (AUBI)**, **Local Zones (BAZs)**, **Fair Tech Partnerships**, **Care Tracker (Love Ledger)**, **Community Work Teams (BWCs)**, and **Global Work Council (GLA)**. Arrows show flows to outcomes: community wellbeing, planet health, creativity.  
- **Implementation**: Interactive SVG at `workinliberation.org/system-map` (Q2 2027), with a thumbnail mockup (nodes, flow arrows).

## 1. Core Principles
1. **Work as Community Contribution**  
   - Redefine work as **care, creativity, and planet healing**, valued via Care Credits (Financial Systems Framework, Section 3).  
   - Ensure survival through **Bonus Income** (Aging Framework, Section 1.1).  

2. **Freedom Over Time**  
   - **Right to say no** to unfair work, with **Flexible Time** for accessibility (Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 2).  
   - Pilot **Shorter Workweeks** (4 days) by 2030, with flexible hours (Post-Work Framework, Section 6.1).  

3. **Fair Reward Systems**  
   - Combine cash, **Care Credits**, and **Eco Credits** (Financial Systems Framework, Section 12.1) (e.g., 60% cash, 40% credits).  
   - Use Indigenous practices like *ayni* (shared work) (Financial Systems Framework, Section 1.1).  

4. **Tech for People**  
   - Tax **AI and robots** (10% productivity gains) to fund Bonus Income (Post-Work Framework, Section 2.1).  
   - Use **Fair Tech Partnerships** to support human values (Post-Work Framework, Section 4.2).  

5. **End Unfair Systems**  
   - Support **Community Work Teams** to replace gig apps by 2040 (Financial Systems Framework, Section 1).  
   - Phase out harmful industries (e.g., fossil fuels by 2035) with **Fair Transition Plans** (Post-Work Framework, Section 3.1).  

## 2. Simplified Components
### 2.1 Global Work Council (GLA)
- **Role**: Guide global standards, support local efforts.  
- **Composition**: 60% workers, 40% community voices (disabled, Indigenous, youth).  
- **Powers**:  
  - Share best practices (e.g., Shorter Workweeks).  
  - Manage Care Credits exchanges (1 hour caregiving = 50 Eco Credits).  
  - Support **Eco-Impact Job Score** markets (Post-Work Framework, Section 2.3).  
- **Governance**: Simple voting, community input via **Community Feedback App** (Post-Work Framework, Section 4.2).  
- **Visual Aid**:  
  - **Prompt**: Flowchart of GLA: central node to community teams, with feedback arrows. Thumbnail mockup (color-coded nodes).

### 2.2 Community Work Teams (BWCs)
- **Role**: Organize work in **Local Zones (BAZs)** (Indigenous Framework):  
  - **Land-back projects**: Indigenous-led farming.  
  - **Care groups**: Disability-led support (Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 3.5).  
  - **Community Work Teams**: Small groups (5-20) for local projects (Post-Work Framework, Section 2.2).  
- **Tools**:  
  - **Community Work App**: SMS-based, matches skills to needs, tracks Care Credits (Financial Systems Framework, Section 3).  
  - **Eco-Impact Job Score**: Rates jobs for planet health, aiming for 30% green jobs by 2040 (Post-Work Framework, Section 8.1).

- **Bonus Income Boosts**: Extra Care Credits (e.g., +20% for caregiving, +30% for green work, Post-Work Framework, Section 2.1).  

### 2.5 Dispute Resolution
- **Community Courts**:  
  - Local mediators and community members resolve issues, using **Fair Tech Audits** for transparency (Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 5).  
  - Enforce via Care Credits adjustments (Financial Systems Framework, Section 7).  
- **Visual Aid**:  
  - **Prompt**: Flowchart: "Dispute Reported" → "Mediation" → "Community Ruling" → "Care Credits Adjustment." Thumbnail mockup (arrows).
