4. **AI-Labor Symbiosis**:
   - Add "Subordination Clause" ensuring AI serves human values
   - Develop "Co-Creation Standards" for human-AI collaboration
   - Include "Turing Council" for ethical oversight

5. **Global Coordination Upgrade**:
   - Replace GLA with "Fractal Labor Parliament" (sortition-based)

This framework is among the most comprehensive and practical post-work proposals currently available. With these enhancements focusing on deeper ecological integration, more robust post-growth foundations, and advanced human-AI collaboration systems, it could become a truly transformative model for 21st century labor governance.

The strongest elements are its multisystem integration and community-focused implementation. The recommended additions would elevate it from an excellent reform framework to a truly transformative vision that redefines humanity's relationship with work in the Anthropocene.
