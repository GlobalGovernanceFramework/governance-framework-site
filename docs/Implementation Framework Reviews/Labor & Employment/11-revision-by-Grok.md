# Work in Liberation: A Transformative Labour & Employment Governance Framework

## Executive Summary: A Day in the Life, 2045
In 2045, in a Tanzanian **Local Zone**, you wake up secure—your **Care Bonus Pay (AUBI)** of $1,200/month, boosted 20% for mentoring youth, plus a **Dignity Baseline** (free housing, food, healthcare), frees you from survival worries. Using a **Community Work App** or paper board, you join a **Community Work Team** to restore a watershed, earning **Care Credits** for local goods. Your **Flexible Time** schedule respects your needs, and a **Shorter Workweek** (15-hour cap) leaves time for creativity. A **Community Renewal** ceremony celebrates your team’s **Planet-Friendly Job Score**, with songs and stories. **Meaningful Work**—care, creativity, planet health—replaces exploitation, guided by **Fractal Labor Parliament** and **Helpful Tech**. By 2045, 50% of people live this way, with 30% of jobs regenerating ecosystems. *Work in Liberation* starts small, adapts, and builds a post-growth, green future.

## Introduction: A Post-Growth Vision for Work
**Vision**: *"From exploited work to meaningful contributions—where care, creativity, and planet health redefine work, fully decoupled from survival, in harmony with ecological boundaries."*

This framework creates **Meaningful Work** through **Care Bonus Pay (AUBI)**, **Community Work Teams**, and **Shorter Workweeks**, prioritizing post-growth principles, ecological regeneration, and AI-labor symbiosis. It integrates **disability justice** (Radical Disability Rights Framework, filename: 11-revision-by-Grok.md), **Indigenous wisdom** (Financial Systems Framework, filename: 22-revision-by-Grok.md), **elder contributions** (Aging Population Support Framework, filename: 13-revision-by-Claude.md), and **post-work innovations** (filename: 2-further-ideas-from-Björn-Kenenth-and-lang.md), using low-tech options, community co-design, and a 20-year plan with robust economic, political, and technical resilience.

## 1. Core Principles
1. **Work as Planetary Contribution**  
   - Redefine work as **care, creativity, planet health**, valued via Care Credits (Financial Systems Framework, Section 3).  
   - **Post-Growth Labor Doctrine**: Prioritize Gross Planetary Health (biodiversity, soil, water) over GDP (DeepSeek, Section 1).  

2. **Freedom from Survival Work**  
   - **Right to refuse** unfair tasks, with **Flexible Time** (Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 2).  
   - **Dignity Baseline**: Unconditional housing, food, healthcare (DeepSeek, Section 3).  
   - **Contribution Ceilings**: Max 15 hours/week required work by 2035 (DeepSeek, Section 3).  

3. **Fair, Plural Rewards**  
   - Combine cash, Care Credits, **Eco Credits** (Financial Systems Framework, Section 5) (60% cash, 40% credits).  
   - Use Indigenous *ayni* for shared work (Financial Systems Framework, Section 1.1).  
   - **Creative Abundance**: Value non-market contributions (e.g., art, knowledge) via **Creative Commons Labor License** (DeepSeek, Section 2).  

4. **Human-AI Symbiosis**  
   - **Automation Dividend**: 50% AI productivity gains fund Care Bonus Pay (DeepSeek, Section 2).  
   - **Subordination Clause**: AI serves human values, overseen by **Turing Council** (DeepSeek, Section 4).  
   - **Co-Creation Standards**: Ensure collaborative human-AI work (DeepSeek, Section 4).  

5. **Ecological and Social Justice**  
   - Replace gig apps with **Community Work Teams** by 2040 (Financial Systems Framework, Section 1).  
   - **Non-Human Stakeholders**: Grant ecosystems labor rights (e.g., rest periods) (DeepSeek, Section 1).  
   - **Industrial Sunsetting**: Phase out harmful sectors (fossil fuels by 2035, fast fashion by 2038) with **Fair Transition Plans** and wage guarantees (DeepSeek, Section 3).
