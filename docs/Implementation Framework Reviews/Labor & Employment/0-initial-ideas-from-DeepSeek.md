### **Radical Framework for Labor & Employment Governance: "Work in Liberation"**  
**Vision:** *"From exploited labor to liberated work—where every act of labor honors dignity, nurtures community, and regenerates the planet."*  

This framework integrates **post-capitalist labor models**, **disability justice**, **Indigenous sovereignty**, and **ecological regeneration** into a cohesive system that transcends traditional employment. It builds on prior frameworks (e.g., *Hearts* currency, AUBI, BAZs) while introducing radical innovations like **care-weighted economies** and **AI co-governance**.  

---

### **Core Principles**  
1. **Labor as Life-Making**  
   - Redefine "work" to include **care, creativity, and ecological stewardship** (aligned with *Hearts* ledger).  
   - **Decouple survival from wage labor** via AUBI (from Aging Framework) and *Hearts* convertible care credits.  

2. **Sovereignty Over Time & Body**  
   - **Right to refuse work** without penalty (e.g., disability accommodations, climate strike protections).  
   - **4-day workweeks** mandated globally by 2030, with **Crip Time** flexibility (from Disability Framework).  

3. **Plural Economies of Value**  
   - **Wages + *Hearts* + *Leaves***: Hybrid compensation (e.g., 50% fiat, 30% *Hearts*, 20% care/ecological credits).  
   - **Indigenous labor protocols**: Honor practices like *ayni* (reciprocal labor) and potlatch (gift economies).  

4. **Post-Human Solidarity**  
   - **AI/robot labor taxed** to fund AUBI (from Financial Framework).  
   - **Non-human labor rights**: Legal personhood for ecosystems (from Indigenous Framework) with "rest" periods (e.g., no deforestation during nesting seasons).  

5. **Abolition of Exploitative Systems**  
   - **Phase out gig economies** by 2035; replace with **worker-owned platforms** (e.g., cooperatives like Sardex).  
   - **Prison labor banned**; transition to **restorative justice economies** (from Aging Framework’s elder councils).

### **Structural Components**  
#### **1. Global Labor Assembly (GLA)**  
- **Composition**: 50% workers (formal/informal), 30% marginalized groups (disabled, Indigenous, migrant), 20% AI observers (trained on labor justice).  
- **Powers**:  
  - Veto exploitative trade deals.  
  - Set **global labor standards** (e.g., max 20:1 CEO-worker pay ratio).  
  - Govern ***Hearts* labor exchanges** (e.g., 1 hour childcare = 50 *Leaves*).  

#### **2. Bioregional Work Councils (BWCs)**  
- **Role**: Coordinate labor needs within BAZs (from Indigenous Framework), e.g.:  
  - **Land-back cooperatives**: Indigenous-led sustainable agriculture.  
  - **Care collectives**: Disability-led mutual aid networks.  
- **Tools**:  
  - **Labor Matching App**: Open-source platform for skill-sharing (integrates *Hearts* ledger).  
  - **Ecological Impact Scores**: Jobs rated by carbon footprint (e.g., fossil fuel work phased out by 2040).  

#### **3. Adaptive Labor Contracts**  
- **Flexible Templates**:  
  - **Seasonal work**: Align with ecological cycles (e.g., fishing bans during spawning).  
  - **Project-based**: Self-determined hours (e.g., artists, caregivers).  
- **AI Co-Design**: Workers train algorithms to draft fair contracts (from Financial Framework’s ethical AI).  

#### **4. Reparative Economies**  
- **Colonialism Repair Bonds**: Tax corporations 5% of profits to fund Indigenous land rematriation and Black cooperative startups.  
- **Care-weighted AUBI**: Extra *Hearts* for historically unpaid labor (e.g., 10% bonus for single parents).  

#### **5. Work Dispute Systems**  
- **Labor Courts**:  
  - **AI mediators** (bias-audited) + **worker juries**.  
  - **Rulings enforceable via *Hearts* sanctions** (e.g., exploitative employers lose *Hearts* access).

### **Implementation Timeline**  
**Phase 1 (2026–2030):**  
- Pilot **BWCs** in 10 BAZs (e.g., Amazon, Nairobi).  
- Launch ***Hearts* labor exchanges** in 5 cities.  
- **Mandate 4-day weeks** for public-sector jobs.  

**Phase 2 (2031–2035):**  
- **Abolish prison labor**; transition to restorative work.  
- **Tax robot labor** at 15% to fund AUBI.  
- **Global gig worker co-op strike** demands platform ownership.  

**Phase 3 (2036–2040):**  
- **Ecological labor mandates**: 50% of jobs must regenerate ecosystems.  
- **AI co-governance**: Workers + AI draft labor policies via GLA.  

---

### **Key Synergies with Prior Frameworks**  
- **Financial Systems**: *Hearts* pay for care work; **Love Ledger** tracks labor value.  
- **Indigenous Governance**: BAZs host **land-back labor models**.  
- **Disability Justice**: **Crip Time** embedded in all contracts.  
- **Aging Framework**: **Elder mentorship** counts as labor.

### **Radical Additions**  
1. **Anti-Worker Surveillance Laws**: Ban productivity-tracking AI unless worker-approved.  
2. **Climate Grief Leave**: Paid time off for ecological trauma (from Mental Health Framework).  
3. **Algorithmic Solidarity**: Workers train AI to **boycott unethical employers** (e.g., apps auto-reject Amazon jobs).  

**Visual Aid**: *A spiral infographic showing labor liberation stages:*  
- **Inner ring**: "Survival Labor" (wage slavery).  
- **Middle ring**: "Sovereign Labor" (AUBI + *Hearts*).  
- **Outer ring**: "Life-Making Labor" (ecosocial harmony).

**Next Steps**:  
1. Draft **model labor constitutions** for BWCs.  
2. Organize **Global Labor Strike 2027** to demand GLA ratification.  
3. Pilot **robot tax** in Norway/South Africa.  

Would you like to refine any component—e.g., deeper ties to *Hearts* or conflict resolution protocols?
