# Work in Liberation: A Radical Labour & Employment Governance Framework

## Introduction: Redefining Labour for a Liberated Future
**Vision**: *"From exploited labour to liberated work—where every act of labour honours dignity, nurtures community, and regenerates the planet."*

This framework reimagines labour and employment as acts of life-making, integrating **post-capitalist labour models**, **disability justice** (from Radical Disability Rights Framework, filename: 11-revision-by-Grok.md), **Indigenous sovereignty** (from Financial Systems Framework, filename: 22-revision-by-Grok.md), and **ecological regeneration**. It builds on prior frameworks, notably the *Hearts* currency and Love Ledger (Financial Systems Framework), Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) (Aging Population Support Framework, filename: 13-revision-by-Claude.md), and Bioregional Autonomy Zones (BAZs) (Indigenous Framework). The framework introduces innovations like **care-weighted economies** and **AI co-governance** to create equitable, resilient, and culturally adaptive labour systems.

**Visual Aid**:  
- **Description**: A spiral infographic illustrating labour liberation stages:  
  - **Inner Ring**: "Survival Labour" (wage slavery, exploitation).  
  - **Middle Ring**: "Sovereign Labour" (AUBI, *Hearts*, flexible contracts).  
  - **Outer Ring**: "Life-Making Labour" (ecosocial harmony, community care).  
- **Implementation**: Interactive digital version on `workinliberation.org/spiral` (launch Q2 2026), with SVG downloads for advocacy.

## 1. Core Principles
1. **Labour as Life-Making**  
   - Redefine "work" to include **care, creativity, and ecological stewardship**, aligned with *Hearts* currency and Love Ledger (Financial Systems Framework, Section 3).  
   - **Decouple survival from wage labour** through AUBI (Aging Framework, Section 1.1) and *Hearts* convertible care credits, ensuring no one works to merely survive.  

2. **Sovereignty Over Time & Body**  
   - **Right to refuse work** without penalty, including accommodations for disability (e.g., *Crip Time* from Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 2) and climate strike protections.  
   - Mandate **4-day workweeks** globally by 2030, with flexible scheduling respecting diverse body/mind needs (*Crip Time*).  

3. **Plural Economies of Value**  
   - **Hybrid compensation**: Combine fiat, *Hearts*, and *Leaves* (Financial Systems Framework, Section 12.1) (e.g., 50% fiat, 30% *Hearts*, 20% care/ecological credits).  
   - **Indigenous labour protocols**: Incorporate practices like *ayni* (reciprocal labour) and potlatch (gift economies) (Financial Systems Framework, Section 1.1).  

4. **Post-Human Solidarity**  
   - Tax **AI and robot labour** to fund AUBI (Financial Systems Framework, Section 15), ensuring automation serves human wellbeing.  
   - Grant **non-human labour rights**, such as legal personhood for ecosystems (Indigenous Framework), with mandated "rest" periods (e.g., no deforestation during nesting seasons).  

5. **Abolition of Exploitative Systems**  
   - **Phase out gig economies** by 2035, replacing them with **worker-owned platforms** (e.g., cooperatives like Sardex, Financial Systems Framework, Section 1).  
   - **Ban prison labour**, transitioning to restorative justice economies led by elder councils (Aging Framework, Section 2.2).  

## 2. Structural Components
### 2.1 Global Labour Assembly (GLA)
- **Composition**: 50% workers (formal/informal), 30% marginalized groups (disabled, Indigenous, migrant), 20% AI observers trained on labour justice principles (aligned with AI Accountability from Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 3.1).  
- **Powers**:  
  - Veto exploitative trade deals.  
  - Set **global labour standards** (e.g., maximum 20:1 CEO-worker pay ratio).  
  - Govern *Hearts* labour exchanges (e.g., 1 hour childcare = 50 *Leaves*, Financial Systems Framework, Section 12.1).  
- **Visual Aid**:  
  - **Prompt**: A flowchart showing GLA structure: central GLA node branching to worker councils, marginalized group representatives, and AI observers, with arrows for veto power and *Hearts* allocation.

### 2.2 Bioregional Work Councils (BWCs)
- **Role**: Coordinate labour within Bioregional Autonomy Zones (BAZs) (Indigenous Framework), including:  
  - **Land-back cooperatives**: Indigenous-led sustainable agriculture.  
  - **Care collectives**: Disability-led mutual aid networks (Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 3.5).  
- **Tools**:  
  - **Labour Matching App**: Open-source platform for skill-sharing, integrated with *Hearts* ledger (Financial Systems Framework, Section 3).  
  - **Ecological Impact Scores**: Jobs rated by carbon footprint, targeting phase-out of fossil fuel work by 2040.  
- **Visual Aid**:  
  - **Prompt**: A network diagram of BWCs: nodes for land-back cooperatives, care collectives, and Labour Matching App, connected by *Hearts* and *Leaves* flows.

### 2.3 Adaptive Labour Contracts
- **Flexible Templates**:  
  - **Seasonal work**: Align with ecological cycles (e.g., fishing bans during spawning).  
  - **Project-based**: Self-determined hours for artists, caregivers, and neurodiverse workers (*Crip Time*, Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 20).  
- **AI Co-Design**: Workers train algorithms to draft fair contracts, using ethical AI principles (Financial Systems Framework, Section 7).  

### 2.4 Reparative Economies
- **Colonialism Repair Bonds**: Tax corporations 5% of profits to fund Indigenous land rematriation and Black cooperative startups (aligned with reparations from Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 2).  
- **Care-weighted AUBI**: Extra *Hearts* for historically unpaid labour (e.g., 10% bonus for single parents, Aging Framework, Section 1.1).  

### 2.5 Work Dispute Systems
- **Labour Courts**:  
  - **AI mediators** (bias-audited, Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 5) and worker juries.  
  - Enforce rulings via *Hearts* sanctions (e.g., exploitative employers lose *Hearts* access, Financial Systems Framework, Section 7).  
- **Visual Aid**:  
  - **Prompt**: A workflow diagram: "Dispute Reported" → "AI Mediation" → "Worker Jury Ruling" → "*Hearts* Sanctions or Resolution."
