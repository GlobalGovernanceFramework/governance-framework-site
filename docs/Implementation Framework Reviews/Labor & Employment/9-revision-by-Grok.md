# Work in Liberation: A Practical Labour & Employment Governance Framework

## Executive Summary: A Day in the Life, 2045
In 2045, in a rural Bolivian **Local Zone**, you wake up secure—your **Extra Pay for Care (AUBI)** of $1,000/month, boosted 20% for teaching kids, covers your needs. Using a **Community Work App** (or paper board), you join a **Local Work Group** to restore a river, earning **Care Credits** for local goods. Your **Flexible Time** schedule accommodates your needs, and a **Shorter Workweek** gives you time for family. At a **Community Renewal** event, you share ideas for green jobs, celebrated with dance. This is **Work With Meaning**: no exploitation, just care and planet health, guided by community councils and **Tech That Helps People**. By 2045, 50% of people live this way, with 30% of jobs scored high on the **Green Job Score**. *Work in Liberation* starts small, learns fast, and grows a fair, green future.

## Introduction: A Feasible Path to Fair Work
**Vision**: *"From exploited work to meaningful contributions—where care, community, and planet health define work, built through practical, community-led steps."*

This framework transforms work into **Work With Meaning**, prioritizing **Extra Pay for Care (AUBI)**, **Local Work Groups**, and **Shorter Workweeks**. It integrates **disability justice** (Radical Disability Rights Framework, filename: 11-revision-by-Grok.md), **Indigenous wisdom** (Financial Systems Framework, filename: 22-revision-by-Grok.md), **elder contributions** (Aging Population Support Framework, filename: 13-revision-by-Claude.md), and **post-work principles** (filename: 2-further-ideas-from-Björn-Kenenth-and-lang.md), using low-tech options, community co-design, and a **20-year plan** with robust economic, political, and technical resilience.

**System Map**:  
- **Description**: One-page diagram linking **Care Credits (*Hearts*)**, **Extra Pay (AUBI)**, **Local Zones (BAZs)**, **Tech That Helps People**, **Care Tracker (Love Ledger)**, **Local Work Groups (BWCs)**, and **Global Work Council (GLA)**. Arrows show flows to outcomes: wellbeing, green jobs.

2. **Freedom to Choose**  
   - **Right to say no** to unfair tasks, with **Flexible Time** for all (Radical Disability Rights Framework, Section 2).  
   - Pilot **Shorter Workweeks** (4 days) by 2032 (Post-Work Framework).  

3. **Fair Rewards**  
   - Combine cash, Care Credits, **Eco Credits** (Financial Systems, Section 5) (e.g., 60% cash, 40% credits).  
   - Use Indigenous practices (*ayni*) for shared work (Financial Systems, Section 1.1).  

4. **Tech for Fairness**  
   - Tax **AI jobs** (10%) to fund Extra Pay for Care (Post-Work Framework, Section 2.1).  
   - Use **Tech That Helps People** to support communities (Post-Work Framework, Section 4.2).  

5. **End Unfair Work**  
   - Replace gig apps with **Local Work Groups** by 2040 (Financial Systems Framework, Section 1).
