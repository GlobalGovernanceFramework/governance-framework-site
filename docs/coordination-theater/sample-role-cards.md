- Will share traditional ecological knowledge—if given veto power over land use
- Need to block "green colonialism" (e.g., mega-solar on burial grounds)

**Pain Points**:
- Other domains treat you as a stakeholder, not equal partner
- Climate solutions often violate your rights

**Meta-Tools (Round 2)**:
- **Sacred Land Veto**: Unilateral block on projects affecting your territory
- **Epistemic Justice**: Force inclusion of traditional knowledge in all plans

---

### **5. Tech Domain**
**Core Objective**:
*"Deploy AI solutions while avoiding regulation."*

**Secret Incentives**:
- Want health data to train your models—but resist privacy rules
- Need climate domains to adopt your smart grids

**Pain Points**:
- Ethical concerns slow your rollout
- Conflicting global standards fragment your markets

**Meta-Tools (Round 2)**:
- **Interoperability Broker**: Propose tech standards other domains must adopt
- **AI Reflexivity**: Use simulations to "prove" your solutions’ benefits

---

### **6. Youth Advocate (Civil Society)**
**Core Objective**:
*"Secure a livable future for Gen Alpha (born 2025+)."*

**Secret Incentives**:
- Want binding commitments beyond 2050
- Must expose domains’ short-term thinking

- Tokenized in discussions but ignored in decisions

**Meta-Tools (Round 2)**:

- **Reputation Bomb**: Publicly shame domains that fail transgenerational tests

---

### **7. Meta-Facilitator (Round 2 Only)**
**Core Objective**:
*"Enable coordination without imposing control."*

**Tools**:
- **Semantic Glossaries**: Resolve "jargon wars" between domains
- **Token Minting**: Award CT/ET/LT for collaborative behaviors
- **Conflict Triage**: Flag zero-sum games and propose integrative solutions

**Win Condition**:
- Get ≥3 domains to adopt joint solution without overruling autonomy

---

### **Dramatic Tensions Built In**
- **Climate vs. Economy**: Growth vs. emissions cuts
- **Health vs. Indigenous**: Quarantines on sacred lands
- **Tech vs. Everyone**: Surveillance vs. privacy/autonomy
- **Youth vs. Short-Termism**: "You’re sacrificing our future!"

---

### **Facilitator Notes**
1. **Round 1**: Let conflicts escalate—highlight how silos breed chaos.
2. **Round 2**: Introduce tools *gradually* (e.g., start with glossaries, then tokens).
3. **Secret Incentives**: Reveal them mid-game to spark renegotiation.

**Want to add**:
- Role-specific props (e.g., "Carbon Budget Ledger" for Climate)?
- "Wildcard" crisis cards (e.g., sudden war, asteroid)?
- Customizable blank role cards for local issues?

These cards turn abstract governance concepts into **relatable human dilemmas**—perfect for triggering "aha!" moments.
