Perhaps add a note in Section 3.16 about developing a "GGF-OS Lite" for smaller organizations.

### 4. **Success Story Framework**
Consider adding to the Maturity Roadmap specific success indicators for each type of Lab.

### 5. **Environmental Offset Specifics**
Section 3.14 could benefit from specific examples of mitigation plans or carbon offset strategies.
