# GGF Operating System (GGF-OS v1.0)

This document serves as the constitution, manifesto, and operational guide for the Global Governance Framework (GGF). It is a public, living document, hosted on a Git repository, and subject to participatory revision processes. The GGF-OS embodies the principles it promotes, acting as a prototype for resilient, participatory governance.

## 0. Preamble: The Call & The Commitment

### The Polycrisis Imperative
We face interconnected global crises—climate change, inequality, conflict, and technological disruption—that demand coordinated, systemic responses. These challenges threaten the well-being of humanity and our planet, requiring a new approach to governance that is adaptive, inclusive, and grounded in shared stewardship.

### Our Response: A Guild of Stewards
The GGF exists to co-create, curate, and disseminate open-source governance frameworks for planetary well-being. We are a global network of contributors working collaboratively to design systems that foster resilience, equity, and sustainability.

### Our Compass: Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI)
The success of GGF is measured not only by its outputs but by the flourishing of its members and the communities it serves. We use a holistic index, Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI), to assess our impact on human and planetary well-being.

### Our Foundation: Integrated Consciousness
Our work integrates healthy expressions of all developmental stages, inspired by Spiral Dynamics:
- **Beige:** Ensuring physical security and survival needs.
- **Purple:** Fostering community belonging and cultural cohesion.
- **Red:** Encouraging bold action and individual agency.
- **Blue:** Upholding shared values and disciplined execution.
- **Orange:** Driving innovation and strategic effectiveness.
- **Green:** Promoting inclusivity and empathy.
- **Yellow/Turquoise:** Embracing systemic, holistic integration.

## 1. Core Principles

These principles, adapted from GGF’s foundational frameworks, guide the organization’s internal operations.

### Radical Transparency
All non-private operational data—finances, decision logs, and project roadmaps—are publicly accessible via platforms like OpenCollective.

### Subsidiarity & Polycentrism
GGF is a modular network of autonomous Working Groups (Labs). Decision-making is localized to Labs for their domains, with a Stewards Circle coordinating only essential network-wide functions.

### Direct & Deliberative Participation
All members have a voice. Decision-making uses a tiered model:
- **Consensus** for charter amendments.
- **Consent** for operational decisions.
- **Individual autonomy** for personal tasks.
Digital tools like Loomio and Pol.is enable scalable deliberation.

### Epistemic Humility & Open Inquiry
We foster curiosity over certainty. An internal “Office of the Adversary” challenges assumptions, and all work is versioned (e.g., v1.0) to encourage iteration.

### Ethical Tooling
We prioritize open-source, privacy-respecting, and decentralized tools. Proprietary tools are used consciously, with clear exit strategies.

### Graceful Obsolescence
GGF is a scaffold, not a monument. A “Sunset Protocol” defines conditions for dissolving or transitioning the organization when its mission is fulfilled.

## 2. Organizational Structure

GGF operates as a holarchy—a system of nested, autonomous units—rather than a traditional hierarchy.

### A. Working Groups (Labs)
- **Purpose:** Core operational units aligned with GGF domains (e.g., Climate & Energy Lab, Peace & Conflict Lab, Digital Commons Lab).
- **Autonomy:** Labs manage their projects, budgets, and teams, adhering to the GGF-OS.
- **Operation:** Each Lab defines its internal processes but aligns with the Charter’s principles.

### B. Roles
- **Contributors:** Individuals contributing code, content, facilitation, or resources.
- **Lab Stewards:** One or two rotating coordinators per Lab, responsible for communication, Charter adherence, and project oversight.
- **Stewards Circle:** A small, rotating body of one steward per Lab, tasked with:
  1. Resource allocation.
  2. Cross-Lab coordination.
  3. Charter guardianship.
  4. External communications.
- **Support Guild:** A specialized Lab providing tools, infrastructure, and administrative support (e.g., legal, financial) to all Labs.

## 3. Operational Protocols

### Code & Content Protocol
- **Repository:** All work is stored in a public Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- **Licensing:** Code uses permissive open-source licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0). Content uses Creative Commons (e.g., CC-BY-SA).
- **Versioning:** Frameworks and documents use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.0.0).

### Communication Protocol
- **Asynchronous-First:** Primary communication is text-based and asynchronous via platforms like Mattermost or Matrix.
- **Synchronous Gatherings:** Optional video calls for high-bandwidth discussions and in-person retreats in nature for strategic alignment.
- **Public Outreach:** GGF shares work through accessible media (e.g., YouTube, podcasts, interactive models).

### Financial Protocol
- **Funding:** Secured through grants, donations, and innovative mechanisms like Reform Impact Bonds.
- **Treasury:** Funds are held in a transparent treasury (e.g., OpenCollective).
- **Allocation:** The Stewards Circle allocates budgets to Labs based on participatory proposals.

### Decision-Making Protocol
- **Tools:** Platforms like Loomio facilitate proposals and voting.
- **Process:** Proposals move from idea to discussion, vote, and implementation, inspired by sociocratic models.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Uses the “Spiral Peacecraft” model for internal disputes.

## 4. Dissolution (Sunset) Protocol

### Review Cycle
Every 3-5 years, GGF conducts a “Purpose Review” to assess its relevance.

### Sunset Criteria
The review evaluates:
- Have global systems integrated resilient, participatory governance, rendering GGF’s role non-essential?
- Are other networks more effectively advancing this mission?

### Dissolution Process
If dissolution is agreed upon:
- Financial assets are donated to an aligned foundation.
- Intellectual assets are archived in a decentralized public commons (e.g., Arweave).

## 5. Supporting Resources

### Culture Deck
A narrative-driven document illustrating the GGF experience, emphasizing LMCI and integrated consciousness in an accessible format.

### Onboarding Journey
An automated process introducing new contributors to the Charter, tools, and a Lab “buddy” for integration.

### Tools & Tech Stack
A living document detailing selected tools, their rationale, and alternatives, ensuring alignment with the Ethical Tooling principle.

This GGF Operating System is a pilot of the governance models we advocate. By embodying our principles, GGF becomes a living demonstration of a regenerative, participatory future.
