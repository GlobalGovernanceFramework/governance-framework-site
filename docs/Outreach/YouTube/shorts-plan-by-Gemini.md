## YouTube Shorts Video Plan: Global Governance Framework

**Overall Goal:** To concisely introduce key concepts of the "Treaty for Our Only Home" and the "Global Governance Framework," making complex ideas digestible, fostering interest, and driving traffic to globalgovernanceframework.org.

**Target Audience:** Engaged citizens, students, academics, policymakers, and anyone concerned about global challenges and seeking solutions.

**General Video Format & Style (for Kdenlive Newbies):**

* **Length:** 30-60 seconds (aim for ~45-50s for most topics).
* **Visuals:**
    * Use compelling, high-quality stock footage (e.g., diverse people, nature, global maps, cityscapes, abstract interconnectedness).
    * Incorporate your optimized PNG versions of the Treaty diagrams (Five Pillars, Dual-Track Approach, perhaps Principles) to visually explain concepts.
    * Animated text overlays for key statistics, terms, or calls to action.
* **Audio:**
    * Clear, concise voiceover (your own or a good quality AI text-to-speech if preferred).
    * Subtle, uplifting, or serious royalty-free background music that matches the tone.
* **Captions:** **Mandatory!** Auto-generated or manually added captions are crucial as many watch Shorts with sound off.
* **Branding:** Your Global Governance Framework logo as a semi-transparent watermark throughout the entire video.
* **Call to Action:** A clear visual and verbal prompt at the end to "Learn more at GlobalGovernanceFramework.org" and "Subscribe!"
