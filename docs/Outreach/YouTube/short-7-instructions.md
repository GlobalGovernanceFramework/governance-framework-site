### **Phase 1: Preparation & Scripting**

1.  **Refine Your Script (Crucial for Shorts):**
    * **Draft:** Write a very tight script, aiming for about 100-120 words for a 30-45 second video.
    * **Key Points to Include:**
        * Hook: Connect to the previous video's idea of unlocking action and pose the question of *who* should act.
        * The Problem: Briefly state that 21st-century challenges need more than just nation-state responses; traditional democracy can sometimes exclude vital voices.
        * The Solution (Pillar 2): Introduce "Integrating New Actors & Voices" as the Treaty's second pillar.
        * Key Mechanisms: Mention concrete examples like:
            * Global Citizens' Initiative (for direct democratic participation).
            * Roles for cities, civil society, indigenous peoples, and youth.
        * Impact: Emphasize that this brings true democratic legitimacy and inclusivity.
        * Call to Action: Direct to your website for more details on participation.
    * **Example Script (feel free to adapt):**
        > "We're unlocking action in global governance. But whose voices will guide it?
        > Our interconnected challenges need more than just traditional nation-state responses. Democracy must evolve to include everyone.
        > That's Pillar 2 of the Treaty: **Integrating New Actors & Voices**.
        > Imagine: direct citizen participation through a Global Citizens' Initiative, alongside formal roles for cities, civil society, indigenous peoples, and youth.
        > This ensures true democratic legitimacy and inclusivity for decisions that affect us all.

2.  **Gather Your Assets:**
    * **Voiceover Audio:**
        * **Option A (Your Voice):** Record yourself reading the script. Maintain an inclusive, empowering, and engaging tone.
        * **Option B (AI Text-to-Speech):** Generate the audio using your chosen AI voice.
    * **Background Music:** Select a royalty-free track that feels collaborative, diverse, and forward-looking.
    * **Visuals (Stock Footage/Images):**
        * **Source:** Free stock video sites like Pexels, Pixabay, Unsplash (for images).
        * **Ideas for this video:**
            * Opening: A quick transition from the previous video's theme (e.g., an abstract image of a resolved deadlock) fading into diverse faces or groups.
            * Problem: Images hinting at unrepresented voices, distant decision-making.
            * Solution (New Actors): Visuals of diverse groups of people collaborating, speaking up, hands joining.
            * Specific Actors: Quick cuts showing city skylines, people engaging in community action, symbols representing indigenous cultures, young people.
            * Global Citizens' Initiative: Abstract visuals of digital voting, interconnected networks of people.
            * Impact: A globe with diverse figures around it, or symbols of collaboration.
        * **Quantity:** Aim for 5-10 short (2-5 second) clips/images that visually represent points in your script.
    * **Your Logo Watermark:** Ensure your Global Governance Framework logo PNG with a transparent background is ready. This will be your video watermark.
