### **Phase 1: Preparation & Scripting**

1.  **Refine Your Script (Crucial for Shorts):**
    * **Draft:** Write a very tight script, aiming for about 100-120 words for a 30-45 second video.
    * **Key Points to Include:**
        * Hook: Connect to previous pillars (unlocking action, including voices) and transition to the need for accountability.
        * The Problem: Highlight the current impunity where powerful actors often operate above the law, especially regarding environmental damage.
        * The Solution (Pillar 3): Introduce "Strengthening Global Law & Enforcement" as the Treaty's third pillar.
        * Key Mechanism: Focus on **Ecocide Law** – criminalizing large-scale environmental destruction.
        * Impact: Emphasize universal application, meaning no actor (corporate or governmental) is above the law, and how this prevents externalized costs onto ecosystems and vulnerable communities.
        * Call to Action: Direct to your website for more details on legal evolution.
    * **Example Script (feel free to adapt):**
        >   "We're building governance for all voices. But what about accountability for those who harm our planet?
        >   Right now, powerful actors often operate with impunity, externalizing environmental costs onto us all.
        >   That's why Pillar 3 is about **Strengthening Global Law & Enforcement**.
        >   Our Treaty proposes **Ecocide Law** – making large-scale environmental destruction a crime. This means universal accountability. No one is above the law, protecting people and planet.

2.  **Gather Your Assets:**
    * **Voiceover Audio:**
        * **Option A (Your Voice):** Record yourself reading the script. Maintain a firm, authoritative, yet hopeful tone.
        * **Option B (AI Text-to-Speech):** Generate the audio using your chosen AI voice.
    * **Background Music:** Select a royalty-free track that conveys a sense of seriousness, justice, and eventual resolution or triumph.
    * **Visuals (Stock Footage/Images):**
        * **Source:** Free stock video sites like Pexels, Pixabay, Unsplash (for images).
        * **Ideas for this video:**
            * Opening: A quick transition hinting at power dynamics, perhaps a subtle visual of scales or a symbol of legal frameworks.
            * Problem (Impunity/Damage): Imagery of environmental destruction (e.g., deforestation, pollution, abstract industrial impact), broken scales of justice.
            * Solution (Law/Enforcement): Gavel striking, abstract legal symbols (e.g., stylized code, interconnected legal lines), images of restoration or protection (e.g., healthy ecosystems, people standing for justice).
            * Ecocide Law focus: A powerful image of nature being protected or restored, with "Ecocide Law" text overlay.
            * Universal Application: Diverse people, global maps with legal symbols spreading.
        * **Quantity:** Aim for 5-10 short (2-5 second) clips/images that visually represent points in your script.
    * **Your Logo Watermark:** Ensure your Global Governance Framework logo PNG with a transparent background is ready. This will be your video watermark.
