Of course. Creating a professional and reusable presentation template is a fantastic way to empower your advocates and ensure brand consistency. Based on your brand identity and the rich content in your framework documents, here is a comprehensive recommendation for your presentation template.

This guide is structured to be used directly to create a master template in Google Slides or PowerPoint.

### **Part 1: The Master Slide Design**

These elements should be set up in the "master slide" view of your presentation software to appear on every slide automatically.

**1. Background:**
* **Default:** A clean, solid white (`#ffffff`) background for maximum readability.
* **Accent/Dark Slides:** For section dividers or high-impact slides, use a background with your Primary Blue (`#2B4B8C`) or the `cosmicGradient`. White text must be used on these slides.

**2. Header & Footer:**
* **Footer (on all slides):**
    * **Left Side:** Add your website URL `globalgovernanceframeworks.org` in small, light gray text.
    * **Right Side:** Add the simplified **GGF Icon** (the favicon version). It should be small and unobtrusive.
    * **Center (Optional):** Add a slide number (`#` of `##`).
* **Header:** Headers should not be in the master slide but should be part of the individual slide layouts (see below).

**3. Typography (Master Settings):**
* **Font:** Set the default font for the entire presentation to **Inter**.
* **Text Color:** Default text color should be a dark, readable gray or off-black (e.g., your `--treaty-wisdom` color, `#2D3748`).
* **Link Color:** Set the default hyperlink color to your Secondary Teal (`#00C49A`).

### **Part 2: Slide Layouts**

Here are the essential slide layouts your advocates will need.

#### **Slide Layout 1: The Title Slide**

This is the first impression and should be visually striking.

* **Background:** Use a high-quality, professional image that represents your mission (e.g., a stunning photo of Earth from space, a diverse group of people collaborating, or an abstract network graphic). Apply a semi-transparent overlay of your Primary Blue (`#2B4B8C`) to ensure text is readable.
* **Content:**
    * **Main Title (Large, White, Inter Bold):** Global Governance Frameworks: A Blueprint for a Thriving World
    * **Subtitle (Smaller, White, Inter Regular):** Transforming our global systems from crisis to resilience.
    * **Presenter Info (Bottom):** Presented by [Presenter's Name/Organization]

#### **Slide Layout 2: Standard Content Slide (Text & Image)**

This will be the most commonly used layout.

* **Structure:** A two-column layout. Left column for text, right column for a visual.
* **Left Column (Text):**
    * **Slide Title (Primary Blue, Inter Bold):** e.g., "The Problem: Our Global Polycrisis"
    * **Body Text (Dark Gray, Inter Regular):** Use concise bullet points.
        * Start with a key takeaway or statistic.
        * Use short, scannable phrases.
        * Never use more than 3-5 bullet points per slide.
* **Right Column (Visual):**
    * An image, an infographic (like your "Five Tiers" pyramid), or a large, impactful statistic (e.g., "$54 Trillion").

#### **Slide Layout 3: Section Divider Slide**

Use this to introduce new sections of the presentation.

* **Background:** Use the Primary Blue (`#2B4B8C`) solid color or the `cosmicGradient`.
* **Content:**
    * **Section Title (Large, White, Inter Bold):** A single, powerful phrase, e.g., "The Five Pillars of Reform"
    * **Icon (Optional):** A large, faint, monochrome version of a relevant icon in the background.

#### **Slide Layout 4: Full-Screen Quote Slide**

Use this for powerful, memorable statements.

* **Background:** White or Primary Blue.
* **Content:**
    * A single, impactful quote from your framework documents.
    * Text should be large, centered, and in **Inter Bold** or **Inter Italic**.
    * Use your Gold accent color (`#DAA520`) for the quotation marks.
