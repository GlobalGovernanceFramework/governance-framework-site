Gemini:
Of course. A general advocacy kit is a crucial tool for empowering your community to spread the word effectively. It should equip them with the core messages, ready-to-use materials, and clear guidance on how to help.

Based on your project's documentation, here is a breakdown of what your general advocacy kit, available at `/get-involved/outreach`, should contain.
