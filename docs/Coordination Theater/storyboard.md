Here’s a **storyboard for a "Coordination Theater" experience**—an immersive, gamified simulation that lets participants viscerally grasp the need for meta-governance. Designed for use at conferences, universities, or community forums.

---

### **Title: "The Leviathan Paradox"**
*A 90-minute live role-playing game where players confront cross-domain crises without meta-governance tools—then replay with them.*

#### **Set-Up**
- **Participants**: 20–50 people, assigned roles:
- *Domain Leaders* (Climate, Health, Economic, Indigenous, Tech, etc.)
- *Civil Society Actors* (NGOs, journalists, youth reps)
- *Meta-Governance Facilitators* (playable in Round 2)
- **Physical Space**:
- Tables arranged in "domain silos" (Round 1) → reconfigured as "council circles" (Round 2)
- Real-time "crisis dashboard" projections

---

### **Round 1: Fragmentation (Chaos Mode)**
*(30 mins – No meta-governance rules)*

1. **Crisis Launch**:
 - Screen displays:
 > *"Year 2030: Pandemic X spreads via climate-driven migration. Health systems collapse. Economic lockdowns trigger food shortages."*

2. **Domain Actions**:
 - Each table receives conflicting directives:
 - *Health*: "Enforce travel bans!"
 - *Economy*: "Keep supply chains open!"
 - *Indigenous*: "Protect sacred lands from triage camps!"
 - Players negotiate **only within their domain**, then broadcast decisions.

3. **Cascade Effects**:
 - Facilitators announce unintended consequences:
 > *"Travel bans disrupted vaccine logistics → Health loses 5 credibility points."*
 > *"Sacred land seizures → Indigenous blockades delay food aid."*

4. **Debrief**:
 - *"How did isolation amplify the crisis?"*
 - Emotion-tracking survey (frustration/confusion metrics).

---

### **Round 2: Coordination (Meta-Governance Mode)**
*(45 mins – Tools unlocked)*

1. **Meta-Tools Introduced**:
 - **Interoperability Protocols**: Shared crisis taxonomy.
 - **Reflexivity Engine**: AI assistant flags policy clashes.
 - **Reputation Tokens**: Awarded for cross-domain solutions.

2. **New Crisis**:
 - > *"Year 2032: AI-driven financial crash worsens energy poverty. Climate adaptation funds diverted."*

3. **Council Formation**:
 - Mixed-domain "crisis councils" form with:
 - *Semantic Translators*: Bridge jargon gaps.
 - *Ethics Arbiters*: Weigh equity trade-offs.
 - *Future Advocates*: Represent 2050+ interests.

4. **Play Dynamics**:
 - **Power Moves**:
 - Economic leader proposes austerity → *Health* counters with "resilience bonds."
 - *Youth* invoke **sunset clause** to force long-term review.
 - **Token Rewards**:
 - +3 CT for brokering energy-health compromise.

5. **Climax**:
 - Groups pitch **coordinated solutions** to "Global Assembly."
 - Real-time impact simulation shows reduced suffering vs. Round 1.

---

### **Closing Ritual**
1. **Collective Intelligence Harvest**:
 - Participants share "coordination insights" on sticky notes → assembled into word cloud.

2. **Call to Action**:
 - *"You’ve experienced the cost of fragmentation—and the power of connection. Now, help build the real thing."*
 - Distribute **Meta-Governance Starter Kits**.

---

### **Design Notes**
- **Tech Enhancements**:
- AR overlays show "policy collision" alerts.
- Wearables capture stress/heart rate during chaos mode.
- **Adaptations**:
- **Corporate Version**: Replace domains with business units (R&D, HR, Finance).
- **Classroom Version**: Simplify for teens (climate vs. economy trade-offs).

**Impact**: Creates "embodied knowing" of meta-governance’s value—more persuasive than any white paper.

Would you like to:
- Script sample **role cards**?
- Map the **crisis simulation algorithms**?
- Design a **lighter "15-minute coffee break" version**?

This turns theory into *felt experience*—the first step toward cultural change.
