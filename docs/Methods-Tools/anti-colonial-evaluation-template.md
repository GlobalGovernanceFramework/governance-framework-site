Here’s a concise yet comprehensive **Anti-Colonial Evaluation Template** for assessing governance tools and methods, designed to surface and mitigate colonial patterns in implementation:

---

# **Anti-Colonial Evaluation Template**
*For Governance Tools & Methods*

## **1. Foundational Questions**
### **A. Origin & Power**
- [ ] **Provenance Audit**: Does this tool/method originate from or disproportionately reflect Western/Global North governance traditions?
- [ ] **Power Map**: Who controls the tool’s adaptation? Are non-Western experts equally resourced to modify it?

### **B. Knowledge Validation**
- [ ] **Epistemic Justice Check**: Does the tool privilege written/quantitative knowledge over oral, experiential, or Indigenous forms?
- [ ] **Untranslatables Log**: Are there core local governance concepts the tool cannot accommodate? (List them)

---

## **2. Implementation Assessment**
### **A. Cultural Friction Points**
| **Risk Area** | **Indicator**| **Mitigation Strategy** |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| Language Dominance | Key terms lack local language equivalents | Co-create glossary with elders|
| Decision Hierarchy | Tool assumes individualist agency| Add collective consent protocols|
| Time Logic | Imposes linear deadlines | Integrate seasonal/event-based cycles |

### **B. Resource Equity**
- [ ] **Participation Cost**: Does using this tool require financial/technical resources unavailable to marginalized groups?
- [ ] **Counter-Power Budget**: Are there dedicated funds for communities to develop alternative tools?

---

## **3. Adaptive Capacity Scoring** (Rate 1–5)
- **Pluralism**: Can the tool coexist with other governance traditions without assimilation?
- **Reversibility**: How easily can communities exit the tool if harmful?
- **Generative Potential**: Does it create space for new, non-colonial governance innovations?

---

## **4. Corrective Actions**
### **For Colonial Patterns Detected**
1. **Divest**: Remove/replace harmful elements (e.g., individualism assumptions).
2. **Decenter**: Shift control to affected communities for redesign.
3. **Diversify**: Allocate resources for parallel non-Western tool development.

### **Reparative Measures**
- [ ] **Oral History Addendum**: Document tool impacts through storytelling.
- [ ] **Land-Based Learning**: Host tool discussions at significant local sites.

---

## **5. Signature & Endorsement**
*We confirm this evaluation was led by those most impacted by colonial governance legacies:*
- **Community Reviewer**: ___________________ (Affiliation)
- **Cultural Translator**: ___________________ (Role)
- **Tool Steward**: ___________________ (Commitment to changes)

---

### **Example Application**
**Tool**: Participatory Budgeting Software
**Colonial Risk**: Assumes individual voting aligns with local consensus traditions.
**Adaptation**: Added "clan delegation" mode where representatives integrate community dialogues.

**Tool**: AI Policy Simulator
**Colonial Risk**: Training data skews toward Euro-American legal systems.
**Adaptation**: Partnered with Indigenous jurists to co-train models on customary law.

---

### **Design Notes**
- **Live Version**: Could be a **fillable PDF with conditional logic** (e.g., if "Epistemic Justice Check" fails, auto-suggests mitigation resources).
- **Training**: Pair with **"Colonial Pattern Spotting" workshops** for evaluators.
- **Integration**: Embed as mandatory step in **Tool Stacks** and **Meta-Governance Coordination Councils**.

Would you like:
1. A **worksheet version** with facilitator guidance?
2. **Case studies** of tools that passed/failed this evaluation?
3. **Metrics** for tracking decolonial progress over time?

This template turns anti-colonial principles into **actionable audit practice**—not just critique, but repair.
