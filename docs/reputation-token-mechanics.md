Here’s a **design for Reputation Token Mechanics** to incentivize and track participation in meta-governance, structured for technical robustness and behavioral alignment:

---

# **Meta-Governance Reputation Token System**
*A Non-Speculative Incentive Mechanism for Cross-Domain Coordination*

## **Core Design Principles**
1. **Non-Tradable**: Tokens cannot be bought/sold (prevent gamification).
2. **Context-Specific**: Value varies by domain/contribution type (e.g., conflict resolution ≠ semantic translation).
3. **Transparent**: All transactions and algorithms auditable.
4. **Anti-Sybil**: Identity-verified participants only (no sock puppets).

---

## **Token Types & Earning Mechanisms**
### **1. Coordination Tokens (CT)**
- **Earned by**:
- Resolving cross-domain conflicts (+1–5 CT per case, weighted by complexity)
- Adopting interoperability protocols (+0.5 CT per standard implemented)
- **Utility**:
- Unlock advanced coordination tools (e.g., AI-reflexivity dashboards)
- Weight in council nominations (e.g., 10 CT = eligibility for advisory roles)

### **2. Equity Tokens (ET)**
- **Earned by**:
- Uplifting marginalized voices (e.g., +2 ET for sponsoring Indigenous delegates)
- Completing power-balancing audits (+1 ET per audit)
- **Utility**:
- Access to equity-focused grants
- Voting weight in resource allocation decisions

### **3. Legacy Tokens (LT)**
- **Earned by**:
- Transgenerational contributions (e.g., +0.1 LT/year for active rights-of-future-generations advocacy)
- Sunsetting obsolete protocols (+1 LT per retired system)
- **Utility**:
- Influence in long-term councils
- Displayed in "stewardship leaderboards"

---

## **Technical Implementation**
### **Architecture**
- **Hybrid Ledger**:
- Public blockchain for transparency (token grants/use)
- Private databases for sensitive deliberation data
- **Smart Contracts**:
- Auto-distribute CT/ET/LT based on verified actions (e.g., conflict resolution logs)
- Enforce decay rules (e.g., CT lose 10% value/year to prevent hoarding)

### **Identity Verification**
- **Tiered Participation**:
- **Basic**: OAuth-style login (email/org verification)
- **Advanced**: Web-of-trust attestations (e.g., 3+ existing members vouch)
- **Governance Delegates**: Institutional credentials (e.g., UN agency ID)

### **Anti-Gaming Safeguards**
- **Collusion Detection**:
- Network analysis flags suspicious token-grant patterns
- AI audits for "token farming" (e.g., artificial conflict creation)
- **Appeals Process**:
- Override automated grants via human juries

---

## **Behavioral Incentives**
| **Desired Behavior** | **Token Reward** | **Anti-Gaming Rule** |
|-----------------------|------------------|-----------------------|
| Mediate climate-health policy clash | +3 CT | Requires 3+ domain confirmations |
| Translate Indigenous land rights into legal protocols | +2 ET +1 CT | Community attestation required |
| Propose sunset clause for obsolete finance rule | +1 LT | Council majority approval |

---

## **Visualizing Reputation**
### **Participant Dashboard**
- **Token Portfolio**: Shows CT/ET/LT balances and trends
- **Comparative Analytics**:
- "You resolved 30% more conflicts than peers in energy-governance"
- **Badges**:
- *Cross-Domain Bridge* (10+ CT)
- *Equity Architect* (5+ ET)

### **System-Wide Transparency**
- **Public Leaderboards**:
- Top conflict resolvers (CT)
- Most innovative equity interventions (ET)
- Long-term stewards (LT)
- **Token Flow Maps**:
- Visualize how domains interact (e.g., "Energy ↔ Oceans co-resolution hotspots")

---

## **Governance of the Token System**
1. **Steering Committee**:
 - 12 members (4 domain experts, 4 ethicists, 4 civil society reps)
 - Adjusts token weights/decay annually based on impact data
2. **Participant Assembly**:
 - Token-holders vote on major rule changes (1 CT = 1 vote, capped at 10 votes/entity)

---

## **Phased Rollout**
### **Phase 1: Pilot (12 months)**
- Test with 3 domains (climate, health, Indigenous governance)
- Manual token grants via facilitated councils
- Iterate on incentive designs

### **Phase 2: Scaling (24 months)**
- Expand to 15 domains
- Semi-automated grants (AI proposal → human approval)
- Public dashboards launched

### **Phase 3: Maturity (36 months+)**
- Full automation with adversarial oversight
- Cross-system reputation portability (e.g., CT redeemable in partner frameworks)

---

## **Key Risks & Mitigations**
| **Risk** | **Mitigation** |
|-----------|----------------|
| Token inflation → devaluation | Decay mechanisms + periodic resets |
| Powerful actors "buy" influence | Non-tradability + caps on voting weight |
| Cultural bias in rewards | Equity Tokens counterbalance dominant narratives |

---

### **Why This Works**
- **Aligns interests**: Domains gain soft power/legitimacy by cooperating.
- **Scales trust**: Tokens become heuristic for "coordination credibility."
- **Prevents capture**: No financialization + equity safeguards.

**Next Steps**:
1. Develop smart contract templates for Phase 1.
2. Design participant onboarding flows.
3. Simulate token economies under stress scenarios.

Would you like to:
- Prototype the **dashboard UI**?
- Draft **token governance bylaws**?
- Model **token decay algorithms**?

This system turns abstract cooperation into **tangible, trackable reputational capital**—the "social API" for planetary coordination.
