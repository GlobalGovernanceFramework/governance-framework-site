# Welcome to Your Community Work Team!

> *"Many hands make light work, many hearts make strong communities."*  
> ‚Äî Traditional Proverb

**Congratulations!** You're taking the first step toward transforming work from something that drains your life into something that nurtures your community and heals our planet. This guide will help you understand what a Community Work Team is and how to get started.

## What is a Community Work Team?

A **Community Work Team (CWT)** is a self-organizing group of neighbors, friends, and community members who come together to do meaningful work that serves real needs. Instead of competing against each other for survival jobs or being exploited by gig platforms, you're cooperating to create value for your community while supporting each other.

Think of it as **reclaiming work** for the people. Your CWT might:
- **Care for community members**: Supporting elders, providing childcare, offering mental health peer support
- **Restore local ecosystems**: Planting trees, cleaning waterways, maintaining community gardens
- **Preserve culture**: Teaching traditional skills, organizing festivals, documenting local stories
- **Build resilience**: Creating emergency preparedness networks, developing local food systems

**The key difference**: Instead of working to make someone else rich, you're working to make your community thrive. Instead of competing, you're cooperating. Instead of extraction, you're regeneration.

## Our Core Principles

Your Community Work Team operates by five simple but powerful principles:

üåç **Our work heals the planet** - Every project we choose helps restore ecological balance rather than destroying it.

üíö **We are free from survival stress** - Through AUBI (universal basic income) and community support, no one has to take exploitative work just to survive.

ü§ù **We value all kinds of contributions** - Whether you're great with your hands, brilliant with technology, wonderful with children, or wise with stories, your gifts matter.

ü§ñ **Technology serves us, not the other way around** - We use digital tools that help us coordinate and connect, but humans always make the important decisions.

‚öñÔ∏è **Justice guides everything we do** - We prioritize the needs of those who have been left out, and we make sure everyone has a voice in decisions that affect them.

## Your First Steps

Ready to begin? Here's your simple path forward:

### ‚úÖ **Step 1: Gather Your Team (3+ people)**
You need at least 3 committed people to start, but 5-8 is often ideal for most projects. Look for neighbors, friends, or community members who share your values and want to contribute to positive change.

### ‚úÖ **Step 2: Draft Your Charter (using our template)**
Your Charter is just a simple one-page document that explains who you are and what you're trying to accomplish. Don't overthink it‚Äîyou can always revise it later! Use the template included in this kit.

### ‚úÖ **Step 3: Hold Your First Circle Meeting**
This is where you'll finalize your Charter, get to know each other better, and choose your first project. Use our meeting guide to make sure everyone feels heard and included.

### ‚úÖ **Step 4: Identify Your First Project**
Start with something small, concrete, and achievable within 2-4 weeks. Success builds momentum! Ask: "What's one need in our community that we could actually help address?"

### ‚úÖ **Step 5: Begin Tracking Your Contributions**
While the global Love Ledger system is still in development, you can start documenting your work now using our simple tracking guide. This ensures you'll receive recognition (in Hearts and Leaves currencies) once the system launches in your area.

## You're Not Alone

Community Work Teams are forming all over the world as part of the **Work in Liberation movement**. You're part of a global transformation toward work that serves life rather than exploiting it.

**Remember**: You don't need permission from anyone to start. You don't need special credentials or perfect plans. You just need people who care about their community and are willing to work together.

Your team has complete autonomy over how you operate, what projects you choose, and how you organize yourselves. The only requirement is that your work serves the principles above‚Äîhealing rather than harming, cooperation rather than exploitation, justice rather than exclusion.
