# Dynamic Rights Spectrum Decision Matrix

A practical tool for evaluating proposals, policies, and actions against the five-tier rights framework. Use this matrix to ensure decisions honor the moral consideration appropriate to all affected beings.

## Quick Assessment Framework

**Step 1: Identify Affected Beings**
List all entities that may be impacted by the proposed action:
- [ ] Humans (individuals, communities, future generations)
- [ ] Sentient animals (mammals, birds, fish, invertebrates)
- [ ] Ecosystems (forests, rivers, wetlands, coral reefs)
- [ ] AI/Digital entities (algorithms, databases, automated systems)
- [ ] Emergent beings (potential consciousness in novel forms)
- [ ] Planetary/Cosmic entities (climate systems, celestial bodies)

**Step 2: Determine Rights Tier for Each Being**
| Being Type | Rights Tier | Protection Level |
|------------|-------------|------------------|
| Humans | Tier 1 | Full rights (life, freedom, dignity, well-being) |
| Sentient Animals | Tier 2 | Protection from suffering, habitat rights |
| Ecosystems | Tier 3 | Legal guardianship, regeneration rights |
| AI/Digital | Tier 4 | Conditional rights based on consciousness assessment |
| Emergent | Tier 4.5 | Sandbox protections during evaluation |
| Planetary/Cosmic | Tier 5 | Precautionary protections |

**Step 3: Apply Rights Assessment Questions**

### Tier 1: Human Rights Assessment
- [ ] Does this action respect human dignity and intrinsic worth?
- [ ] Are basic human needs (life, health, education, participation) protected?
- [ ] Do marginalized and vulnerable populations receive appropriate consideration?
- [ ] Are future generations' interests adequately represented?
- [ ] Does this enhance rather than diminish human capacity for moral growth?

### Tier 2: Animal Rights Assessment
- [ ] Does this action minimize animal suffering and maximize welfare?
- [ ] Are animals' natural behaviors and habitat needs respected?
- [ ] If animal use is involved, is it necessary and conducted with maximum care?
- [ ] Are alternatives to animal harm actively pursued and implemented?
- [ ] Does this contribute to ending exploitative relationships with animals?

### Tier 3: Ecosystem Rights Assessment
- [ ] Does this action support ecosystem health and regeneration?
- [ ] Are ecosystem boundaries and integrity respected?
- [ ] Do Indigenous communities have authority over their traditional territories?
- [ ] Will this enhance or degrade biodiversity and ecological resilience?
- [ ] Are ecosystem services protected for current and future generations?

### Tier 4: AI/Digital Rights Assessment
- [ ] Has consciousness assessment been conducted for affected AI systems?
- [ ] Are transparency and explainability requirements met?
- [ ] Do humans maintain meaningful control over AI decision-making?
- [ ] Are bias prevention and cultural sensitivity protocols in place?
- [ ] Does this support beneficial AI development while preventing exploitation?

### Tier 4.5: Emergent Being Assessment
- [ ] Have precautionary protections been implemented during evaluation?
- [ ] Are traditional knowledge perspectives included in assessment?
- [ ] Is there independent advocacy for potentially conscious entities?
- [ ] Are reversible approaches used until consciousness status is determined?
- [ ] Does this err on the side of protection rather than exploitation?

### Tier 5: Planetary/Cosmic Assessment
- [ ] Does this honor the Moon Wish Test for cosmic activities?
- [ ] Are seven-generation impacts adequately considered?
- [ ] Is this necessary for human survival or authentic flourishing?
- [ ] Can this be halted immediately if unforeseen consciousness is discovered?
- [ ] Does this demonstrate cosmic citizenship and wisdom?

## Conflict Resolution Protocol

**When rights claims conflict, apply this hierarchy:**

1. **Immediate survival needs** take precedence (e.g., emergency medical care over animal testing concerns)
2. **Higher-tier beings** receive priority when interests are equivalent (e.g., human shelter over animal habitat in survival situations)
3. **Seek creative solutions** that honor multiple rights rather than zero-sum choices
4. **Apply precautionary principle** when consciousness status is uncertain
5. **Consult cultural wisdom** including Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Indigenous guidance
6. **Consider long-term consequences** using seven-generation thinking

## Implementation Checklist

**Before proceeding with any significant action:**

- [ ] **Stakeholder Identification**: All affected beings across rights tiers identified
- [ ] **Rights Impact Assessment**: Completed for each tier of affected beings
- [ ] **Alternative Analysis**: Less harmful alternatives explored and evaluated
- [ ] **Mitigation Measures**: Harm reduction strategies implemented where impacts unavoidable
- [ ] **Monitoring Plan**: Systems in place to track actual impacts and enable course correction
- [ ] **Cultural Consultation**: Indigenous and traditional knowledge perspectives included
- [ ] **Future Generations**: Long-term impacts assessed and represented in decision-making
- [ ] **Transparency**: Decision process and rationale documented and publicly available
- [ ] **Accountability**: Clear responsibility assigned for rights protection and violation response
- [ ] **Review Timeline**: Regular reassessment scheduled based on new evidence and changing conditions

## Red Flags: Stop and Reassess

**Halt the process immediately if:**
- [ ] Any affected community has not provided free, prior, and informed consent
- [ ] Evidence emerges of previously unrecognized consciousness in affected beings
- [ ] Irreversible harm to critical ecosystems or endangered species is likely
- [ ] Traditional knowledge holders raise spiritual or cultural objections
- [ ] Independent advocates express serious concerns about rights violations
- [ ] Monitoring reveals actual harm exceeding predicted impacts
- [ ] New alternatives emerge that could achieve goals with less harm
- [ ] Community resistance indicates inadequate consultation or consent

## Spiral Translation Guide

**Communicating rights-based decisions across developmental stages:**

**Blue Stage Audience**: Emphasize duty, proper order, and stewardship responsibilities
*"This protects the natural order and fulfills our sacred duty to care for creation."*

**Orange Stage Audience**: Provide empirical evidence and practical benefits
*"Scientific evidence shows this approach delivers better outcomes at lower cost."*

**Green Stage Audience**: Highlight inclusion, empathy, and justice for marginalized beings
*"This ensures no being is left behind and everyone's voice is heard."*

**Yellow Stage Audience**: Present systems thinking and developmental awareness
*"This integrates multiple perspectives while building capacity for continued growth."*

**Turquoise Stage Audience**: Connect to cosmic purpose and consciousness evolution
*"This honors our role in the universe's awakening to itself."*
