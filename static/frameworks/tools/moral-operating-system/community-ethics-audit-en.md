### **How to Calculate and Use the Score**

The scoring process is designed to be a tool for facilitating a structured, ethical dialogue, not just to produce a final number. The score helps the community pinpoint specific areas of strength and concern.

**The Process:**

1.  **Score Each Question:** For each of the 10 questions in the audit, the assessment team assigns a score based on the five-point scale, from **-2 (Harmful)** to **+2 (Excellent)**. This should be done through discussion and consensus.

2.  **Sum the Scores:** The total score is the sum of the scores from all 10 questions. The final score will be in the range of **-20** (most harmful) to **+20** (most beneficial).

3.  **Analyze Both Scores:** It is crucial to look at two things:

      * **The Total Score:** This gives an overall impression of the project's ethical alignment. Use the "Scoring Interpretation Guide" to see the recommended action.
      * **The Individual Scores:** Pay close attention to any question that scored a -1 or -2. Even a project with a high total score might have a critical flaw in one area (e.g., it's great for the economy but violates Indigenous rights). These individual low scores must be addressed.

The ultimate goal of the scoring is to create a clear, evidence-based foundation for the community's recommendations.

### Phase 3: Scoring and Recommendations (45 minutes)

**Scoring Interpretation Guide:**

| Total Score | Recommendation | Action Steps |
|-------------|----------------|--------------|
| **15-20** | **Enthusiastic Approval** | Proceed with strong community support and celebration |
| **10-14** | **Conditional Approval** | Proceed with minor modifications and enhanced safeguards |
| **5-9** | **Major Revision Required** | Significant changes needed before community approval |
| **0-4** | **Substantial Concerns** | Major redesign required to address ethical problems |
| **Below 0** | **Community Rejection** | Project fundamentally incompatible with community values |

**Detailed Recommendations Framework:**

**For High-Scoring Projects (15-20):**
- Identify specific aspects that exemplify community values for celebration and replication
- Develop community ownership and leadership opportunities
- Create monitoring systems to ensure benefits are realized as promised
- Document success factors for application to future projects

**For Moderate-Scoring Projects (5-14):**
- Identify specific questions with low scores for targeted improvement
- Require project modifications addressing community concerns
- Establish enhanced monitoring and community oversight mechanisms
- Create opportunities for community benefit enhancement

**For Low-Scoring Projects (Below 5):**
- Require fundamental project redesign before reconsideration
- Address core ethical violations through alternative approaches
- Consider whether project goals can be achieved through different methods
- Provide feedback to project proponents about community values and requirements

### Phase 4: Community Action Planning (30 minutes)

**Implementation Pathway Development:**

**For Approved Projects:**
- **Community Oversight Committee**: Establish ongoing monitoring and evaluation body
