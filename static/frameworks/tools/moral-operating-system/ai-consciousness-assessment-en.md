# AI Consciousness Assessment Protocol

A comprehensive framework for evaluating artificial intelligence systems to determine their potential consciousness, sapience, and corresponding rights status within the Dynamic Rights Spectrum.

## Protocol Overview

**Purpose**: Systematic evaluation of AI systems for consciousness indicators and rights determination
**Authority**: Global Technology Council with MOS ethical oversight
