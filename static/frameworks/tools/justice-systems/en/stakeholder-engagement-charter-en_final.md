# Stakeholder Engagement Charter Template

## Overview
The **Stakeholder Engagement Charter Template** provides a customizable framework for jurisdictions to establish structured, inclusive, and transparent processes for engaging stakeholders in the Justice Systems Implementation Framework. It defines roles, responsibilities, engagement mechanisms, and conflict resolution protocols to ensure diverse groups—policymakers, community organizations, indigenous leaders, youth, and legal practitioners—actively shape pilot projects and framework implementation. Enhanced with a stakeholder mapping tool, engagement fatigue mitigation strategies, and technology selection criteria, it fosters trust, equity, and collaboration to achieve the framework’s goals of 25% increased public trust, 80% fair access, and 70% case resolution by 2035, as outlined in the [Stakeholder Engagement](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#07-stakeholder-engagement) section.

**Purpose**: To create a formal agreement that guides stakeholder participation, ensures representation of marginalized groups, and integrates feedback into justice system reforms.

**Target Users**: National Implementation Units, Regional Justice Hubs, community leaders, and stakeholder representatives.

**Format**: Modular template with fillable sections, visual mapping tool, fatigue mitigation guidance, technology criteria, and adaptation instructions.

**Access**: Available at [Tools Library](/frameworks/tools/justice-systems/stakeholder-engagement-charter-en.pdf) in PDF, markdown, and offline formats. Multilingual versions planned by Year 2 (2027).

## Instructions
1. **Customize the Template**: Fill in each section with jurisdiction-specific details (e.g., stakeholder groups, engagement mechanisms). Adapt up to 20% of content to align with local contexts, with approval from Regional Justice Hubs ([Appendices](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#11-appendices)).
2. **Map Stakeholders**: Use the Visual Stakeholder Mapping Tool to analyze influence and interest, informing engagement strategies.
3. **Engage Stakeholders**: Consult diverse groups during drafting, applying fatigue mitigation strategies to sustain participation, as per the [Stakeholder Engagement Guide](/frameworks/tools/justice-systems/stakeholder-engagement-guides).
4. **Select Technology**: Choose digital engagement platforms based on the Technology Selection Criteria, prioritizing data privacy and sovereignty.
5. **Formalize the Charter**: Secure agreement from stakeholders via consensus or majority vote, as per local governance protocols ([Governance Structure](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#02-governance-structure)).
6. **Implement Engagement**: Execute the engagement plan, leveraging community forums, digital platforms, and offline outreach.
7. **Monitor and Revise**: Track engagement metrics (e.g., participation rates) and revise the charter biannually, integrating results into the framework’s metrics dashboard ([Monitoring and Accountability](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#06-monitoring-accountability)).
8. **Submit for Support**: Share the finalized charter with Regional Justice Hubs for feedback and resources (e.g., mediator training, funding).

## Stakeholder Engagement Charter

### 1. Purpose and Scope
**Purpose**: This charter outlines the principles, processes, and commitments for engaging stakeholders in the implementation of the Justice Systems Implementation Framework within [Jurisdiction/Region Name]. It ensures inclusive participation, equitable representation, and transparent feedback integration to support pilot projects and justice reforms.

**Scope**: Applies to all stakeholder engagement activities related to framework implementation, including policy development, pilot planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Covers [specific activities, e.g., pilot project design, legal harmonization workshops].

**Alignment**: Adheres to the framework’s principles of universal access, rule of law, cultural sensitivity, and transparency, as outlined in the [Introduction](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#01-introduction).

### 2. Stakeholder Identification and Mapping
List key stakeholder groups, ensuring representation of marginalized communities (e.g., indigenous groups, youth, low-income populations). Use the Visual Stakeholder Mapping Tool to analyze influence and interest, prioritizing engagement strategies.

| Stakeholder Group | Description | Priority (High/Medium/Low) | Contact Representative |
|-------------------|-------------|----------------------------|-----------------------|
| e.g., Indigenous Communities | Traditional justice leaders and councils | High | [Name, Contact Info] |
| e.g., Youth Organizations | Youth-led advocacy groups | High | [Name, Contact Info] |
| e.g., Policymakers | Ministry of Justice officials | Medium | [Name, Contact Info] |
| e.g., Community Organizations | NGOs focused on legal aid | Medium | [Name, Contact Info] |
| e.g., Legal Practitioners | Judges, lawyers, mediators | Medium | [Name, Contact Info] |

**Visual Stakeholder Mapping Tool**:
- **Purpose**: To prioritize engagement by assessing stakeholders’ influence (ability to affect outcomes) and interest (level of concern in the framework).

![Mapping Tool](/images/frameworks/justice/stakeholder-mapping-tool.svg)

- **Instructions**:
  1. Plot each stakeholder group on the matrix based on influence (high/low) and interest (high/low).
  2. **High Influence/High Interest**: Prioritize active engagement (e.g., regular forums).
  3. **High Influence/Low Interest**: Keep informed (e.g., policy briefs).
  4. **Low Influence/High Interest**: Involve in consultations (e.g., surveys).
  5. **Low Influence/Low Interest**: Monitor and provide updates (e.g., newsletters).
  6. Update the map annually or after major implementation milestones ([Timeline and Milestones](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#09-timeline-milestones)).

**Adaptation Note**: Add or modify groups to reflect local demographics. Ensure ≥50% of groups represent marginalized communities.

### 3. Engagement Principles
The following principles guide stakeholder engagement, ensuring alignment with framework goals:

- **Inclusivity**: Prioritize participation of marginalized groups, targeting ≥50% representation in engagement activities by Year 2 (2027).
- **Transparency**: Publicly disclose engagement processes, outcomes, and feedback integration via the framework’s digital repository ([Tools Library](/frameworks/tools/justice-systems)).
- **Cultural Sensitivity**: Respect local traditions and languages, using cultural liaison officers where needed ([Legal Framework](/frameworks/docs/implementation/justice-systems#03-legal-framework)).
- **Accountability**: Establish clear mechanisms for addressing grievances and ensuring stakeholder input influences decisions.
- **Accessibility**: Provide engagement opportunities in multiple formats (e.g., in-person, digital, offline) and languages.
- **Sustainability**: Mitigate engagement fatigue to maintain participation over the 10-year implementation period.
