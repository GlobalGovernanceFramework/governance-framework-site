# Youth Justice Guide

> **"Youth are not only the future of justice—they are the present. This guide helps you lead the way."**

## Overview
The **Youth Justice Guide** equips jurisdictions with strategies and tools to reform youth justice systems under the Justice Systems Implementation Framework, emphasizing rehabilitation, restorative practices, and equitable access for marginalized youth (e.g., indigenous, low-income, minority groups). It integrates restorative justice, community engagement, and digital innovations to address systemic challenges like disproportionate sentencing and recidivism, as outlined in the [Restorative Justice](/frameworks/justice-systems#restorative-justice) section. The guide is adaptable to diverse cultural and resource contexts, supporting the framework's goals of **25% increased public trust**, **80% fair access**, and **70% case resolution** by 2035.

**Purpose**: To guide National Implementation Units, Regional Justice Hubs, and youth advocates in designing and implementing youth justice reforms that prioritize rehabilitation and equity.

**Target Users**: National Implementation Units, Regional Justice Hubs, youth organizations, indigenous leaders, policymakers, and community stakeholders.

**Format**: Modular guide with principles, strategies, implementation steps, templates, monitoring metrics, and adaptation guidelines.

**Access**: Available at [Tools Library](/frameworks/tools/justice/youth-justice-guide-en.pdf) in PDF, markdown, and offline formats. Multilingual versions planned by Year 2 (2027).

## Know Your Rights
Youth have specific rights within justice systems that must be protected and upheld. These include:

- **Right to be heard**: Your voice matters in all decisions affecting you
- **Right to fair treatment**: Free from discrimination based on race, gender, economic status, or other factors
- **Right to legal assistance**: Access to attorneys and support, explained in language you understand
- **Right to safety**: Protection from harm, intimidation, and re-traumatization
- **Right to rehabilitation**: Focus on recovery and reintegration, not punishment
- **Right to privacy**: Confidentiality of your case and personal information
- **Right to education**: Continued learning opportunities throughout justice processes
- **Right to cultural connection**: Respect for your cultural identity and practices

These rights are protected under the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child and other human rights frameworks. If your rights are violated, you can report this through the complaint mechanisms outlined in this guide.

## Youth Justice Principles
The following principles guide youth justice reforms, ensuring alignment with equity, rehabilitation, and cultural sensitivity:

- **Rehabilitation Focus**: Prioritize rehabilitation over punishment, targeting 80% of youth cases using restorative practices by Year 4 (2029).

## Youth Justice Strategies
Follow these strategies to implement youth justice reforms, customizable to local contexts.

### Strategy 1: Conduct Youth Justice Gap Analysis
- **Objective**: Identify gaps in current youth justice systems.
- **Actions**:
  - Use the Youth Justice Gap Analysis Template (below) to assess access, equity, and rehabilitation metrics.
  - Collect data on youth case outcomes, recidivism rates, and marginalized group representation, referencing [Monitoring & Evaluation Rubric Template](/frameworks/tools/justice/monitoring-evaluation-rubric-en.pdf).
  - Engage youth, families, and indigenous leaders in focus groups, targeting 50% marginalized group input by Year 2 (2027).
  - Identify resource needs (e.g., mediators, digital tools) using the [Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool](/frameworks/tools/justice/pilot-readiness-self-assessment-tool-en.pdf).
- **Output**: Gap analysis report, submitted to Regional Justice Hubs.
- **Timeline**: 2–3 months.

> **YOUTH VOICE**: *"Don't just collect data about us—collect data with us. We know what's happening in our communities and what barriers we face. Train young people as co-researchers to help gather more honest feedback from other youth."*

### Strategy 2: Develop Restorative Youth Justice Programs
- **Objective**: Implement restorative practices for youth rehabilitation.
- **Actions**:
  - Design programs (e.g., victim-offender mediation, peer circles) using the [Restorative Justice Guide](/frameworks/tools/justice/restorative-justice-guide-en.pdf), targeting 80% of eligible cases by Year 4 (2029).

## Success Story: Tasha's Journey

> When 16-year-old Tasha was caught shoplifting electronics from a local store, her case could have followed the traditional path through juvenile court. Instead, her community had implemented the Youth Justice Guide's restorative approaches. 
> 
> Tasha was referred to a peer-led mediation circle where she met with the store owner in a safe, supportive environment. Rather than focusing on punishment, the circle explored the impacts of her actions and underlying factors—Tasha revealed she was trying to resell the items to help her family with rent after her mother lost her job.
> 
> The circle's youth facilitator, who had been trained through the local Youth Advisory Council, guided Tasha to make amends by working at the store for two months. The store owner, moved by her situation, offered her a part-time position afterward. Community services helped her family with housing support.
> 
> Six months later, Tasha joined her community's Youth Justice Council, where she now helps design programs for other youth. "The circle saw me as a whole person, not just my mistake," she explains. "Now I help make sure other young people get the same opportunity to be heard and supported."
> 
> Tasha's case represents the framework's success: rehabilitation over punishment, community involvement, and youth empowerment—resulting in no formal record and a 0% recidivism outcome.

|--------|--------|--------------------|-----------|
| Restorative Resolution Rate | ≥80% of eligible youth cases resolved by Year 4 (2029) | Case records | Biannually |
| Access for Marginalized Youth | ≥80% coverage by Year 4 (2029) | Legal aid and service logs | Biannually |
| Youth Participation | ≥50% youth-led initiatives by Year 3 (2028) | Advisory council and forum records | Quarterly |
| Recidivism Rate | ≤15% recidivism by Year 5 (2030) | Reoffense data | Annually |
| Stakeholder Satisfaction | ≥85% satisfaction by Year 4 (2029) | Surveys, youth feedback | Biannually |

**Integration**: Metrics feed into the centralized dashboard ([Monitoring and Accountability](/frameworks/justice-systems#06-monitoring-accountability)), with youth-friendly reporting formats.

**Adaptation Note**: Customize metrics (up to 20%) for local priorities (e.g., indigenous youth recidivism).

> **YOUTH VOICE**: *"Don't just collect numbers—ask us what success means to us. Sometimes the most important changes are the hardest to measure, like feeling respected or hopeful about the future."*

## Customization Guidelines
- **Adaptation**: Modify up to 20% of content to align with local contexts (e.g., add indigenous youth protocols) with approval from Regional Justice Hubs and stakeholders.
- **Examples**:
  - Add strategies for urban youth gang rehabilitation.
  - Adjust metrics for rural youth access.
  - Include culturally specific restorative practices (e.g., tribal storytelling).
- **Documentation**: Record adaptations in an annex for transparency.

## Implementation and Support
- **Launch**: Convene a youth justice task force by [date, e.g., Q2 2027] to finalize the plan.
- **Submit**: Share plans and reports with Regional Justice Hubs via secure platforms or offline channels ([Tools Library](/frameworks/tools/justice)).
- **Request Assistance**: Contact [globalgovernanceframeworks@gmail.com] for funding, training, or support.
- **Feedback**: Submit guide usability feedback via the engagement platform for biannual updates (July and January).

## Youth Forum Toolkit
To support youth-led engagement, consider using these forum components:

- **Discussion Formats**: Circle processes, small group breakouts, and one-on-one interviews 
- **Engagement Materials**: Name tags, colored cards for voting, large paper for group ideas
- **Facilitation Tips**: Start with an icebreaker, use plain language, create safe space agreements
- **Decision-Making Tools**: Consensus cards (green/yellow/red), dot voting for priorities
- **Digital Integration**: QR codes for anonymous feedback, social media reporting templates
- **Follow-Up Framework**: Action plan template, progress tracking chart, celebration formats

Youth facilitators should receive training on creating inclusive spaces where all voices—especially the most marginalized—can be heard.

## Monitoring Progress
- **Review Cycles**: Evaluate biannually, revising based on youth and community feedback.
- **Reporting**: Integrate outcomes into quarterly dashboard updates ([Monitoring and Accountability](/frameworks/justice-systems#06-monitoring-accountability)).
- **Success Metrics**: Achieve 80% restorative resolution, 80% access for marginalized youth, and ≤15% recidivism by Year 5 (2030).

> **YOUTH VOICE**: *"This work doesn't end with implementation—it's an ongoing journey. We need to keep asking questions, listening to each other, and being brave enough to change what isn't working. Justice systems should grow and learn just like we do."*
