## Introduction to the Seed Track

The Seed Track provides a lightweight, high-impact pathway for smaller IGOs and resource-constrained organizations to begin institutional regeneration. This streamlined version focuses on essential elements that can generate immediate momentum while building toward fuller implementation.

**Target Organizations**: Regional bodies, specialized UN agencies, smaller development banks, or departments within larger institutions.

**Resource Requirements**: Approximately 20-30% of full framework requirements, designed for implementation with existing staff capacity.

**Timeline**: 6-12 months for initial implementation, building foundation for future expansion.
