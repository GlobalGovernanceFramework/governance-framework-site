#### **4. Technology Governance Implementation Framework (TGIF) (`33-grok-revision.md`)**

This is your "central command." The updates here should focus on formalizing the coordination between the other frameworks.

* **Current Role:** To provide high-level governance, coordination, and crisis response for all technology.
* **Suggested Updates:**
    * **This is the most important update:** In **Section 5 (The Global Technology Council)**, formally add a permanent sub-council called the **"Cybersecurity & Resilience Council."** Its mandate would be to coordinate the activities of the Shield, Aurora, and Digital Commons frameworks. This council doesn't make new rules; it ensures the existing ones work together seamlessly.
    * **In Appendix H (Tech Crisis Response Unit):** Expand this appendix significantly. Detail the unit's relationship with the `Shield Protocol's` GETF. For example: The **TCRU** is the "first responder" for diagnosis and containment, while the **GETF** is the "investigative unit" that pursues the attackers.
    * **In Section 8.4 (Crisis Governance Mode):** Add a specific trigger condition related to cybersecurity, such as: "A confirmed Tier 1 cyberattack on critical GGF infrastructure (e.g., the AUBI transaction ledger) automatically activates Crisis Governance Mode."
