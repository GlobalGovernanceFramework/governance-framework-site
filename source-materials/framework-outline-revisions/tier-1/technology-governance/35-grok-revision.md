## **1. Preamble: Technology as World-Building**
From Prometheus’ fire to the weaver’s loom, from the printing press to the digital neuron, technology is humanity’s act of world-building—a sacred responsibility to shape reality with wisdom, care, and reverence. It holds the power to weave communities together, restore ecosystems, or unravel existence if unchecked. This framework embraces technology as a partner in co-creating a regenerative, inclusive, ethically aligned future, guided by human and non-human wisdom, rooted in Earth’s rhythms, and committed to justice for all beings.
