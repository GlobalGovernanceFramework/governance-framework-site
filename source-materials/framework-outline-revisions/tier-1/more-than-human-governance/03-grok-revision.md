# The More-Than-Human Governance Framework: A Framework for Life-Centric Representation (Version 2)

**Tier:** 1  
**Status:** Concept Draft (Version 2)  
**Implementation Priority:** Critical  

## 1. Introduction & Vision

### 1.1 Vision
To evolve global governance from a human-centric model to a life-centric paradigm, where the inherent agency and rights of non-human entities are formally represented and integrated into all levels of decision-making within the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF).

### 1.2 Purpose & Scope
- Provides the **procedural and institutional architecture** for the formal representation of non-human entities within the GGF.
- Complements the **Moral Operating System (MOS)**, which defines *who has rights*, by answering *how their rights are represented*.
- Covers entities defined in MOS Tiers 2-5: Sentient Animals, Ecosystems, AI/Digital Entities, Emergent Entities, and Planetary/Alien Beings.

### 1.3 GGF Architectural Role
Serves as a foundational "Operating System" within the Ethical OS cluster, providing universal protocols that all GGF frameworks must integrate when impacting non-human entities.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Principle of Agency over Welfare
- Distinguishes between welfare (preventing harm) and agency (enabling an entity’s inherent nature and right to flourish).  
  *Example:* Ensuring a river remains unpolluted (welfare) and upholding its right to flow, meander, and flood (agency).

### 2.2 Principle of Fiduciary Guardianship
- Non-human entities are represented by human proxies ("Guardians") with a legally binding fiduciary duty to act in the entity’s best interests, free from human-centric economic or political conflicts.

### 2.3 Principle of Subsidiarity of Voice
- The right to represent a non-human entity belongs to the most local and connected human community. Indigenous Bioregional Autonomy Zones (BAZs) hold primary guardianship rights over their ecosystems, delegable only with their consent.

### 2.4 Principle of Evidentiary Pluralism
- The "voice" or "will" of a non-human entity is understood through multiple epistemologies: scientific data (e.g., Biosphere Health Index), Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), and community observation.

### 2.5 Principle of Non-Contradiction and Precaution
- When scientific data, TEK, or community observation conflict, evidence is synthesized through dialogue. If synthesis is not possible and credible evidence indicates significant risk, the precautionary principle halts the motion until risks are addressed.

## 3. Structural Components

### 3.1 The Council of All Beings
- **Composition:** A high-level advisory and oversight body of designated Guardians, including:
  - Guardians for Major Biomes (e.g., Oceans, Boreal Forests), nominated by the **Earth Council** and **Planetary Health Council**.
  - Guardians for Species Archetypes (e.g., Great Apes, Cetaceans, Pollinators), nominated by the **Animal Welfare Council**.
  - Guardians for Digital & Emergent Entities, nominated by the **Global Technology Council**.
- **Mandate:** Sets global guardianship standards, validates Guardian selection, and holds veto power over planetary-scale decisions posing existential threats (e.g., geoengineering, off-world resource extraction).

### 3.2 The Office of Guardianship
- **Function:** Administers the **Guardianship Protocol**, managing:
  - Credentialing, training, and supporting Guardians.
  - Maintaining a global registry of Guardians.
  - Allocating resources from the **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`) for monitoring, research, and advocacy.
- **Support Systems:**
  - **Continuing Education:** Regular training in scientific advances and TEK protocols.
  - **Peer Networks:** Annual convenings for Guardians to share knowledge and best practices.

### 3.3 Guardian Roles within the GGF
- Mandates formal, voting seats for Guardians on:
  - **Planetary Health Council (`council_phc`)**
  - **Animal Welfare Council**
  - **Global Technology Council (`council_gtc`)**
  - **Meta-Governance Coordination Council (`council_mgcc`)**
- Guardians present **Impact Statements** (No Harm, Concern, or Objection) before council votes, with Objection triggering a supermajority threshold (e.g., two-thirds or three-quarters).

## 4. Guardianship Protocol

### 4.1 Guardian Selection Criteria
- **Core Competencies:**
  - Deep relationship knowledge with the entity or ecosystem.
  - Epistemic fluency in scientific, traditional, and experiential evidence.
  - Conflict-free status, with no economic or political interests conflicting with the entity’s wellbeing.
  - Cultural competency in local protocols and relationships.
- **Specialized Requirements:**
  - **Ecosystem Guardians:** Minimum 10 years local residence or traditional connection.
  - **Species Guardians:** Scientific expertise or TEK holder status.
  - **Digital Entity Guardians:** Technical and ethical expertise in AI systems.

### 4.2 Accountability Mechanisms
- **Annual Review:** Peer Guardian councils assess performance, integrating community feedback and entity wellbeing indicators.
- **Replacement Protocol:** Community-initiated process to replace ineffective Guardians.
- **Term Limits:** Maximum 7-year terms to prevent capture.
- **Appeal Mechanisms:** Pathways for communities to challenge Guardian decisions.

### 4.3 Funding and Economic Integration
- Guardianship is recognized as **"Work with Purpose"** under `framework_work_liberation`, eligible for **Hearts** rewards (`mechanism_hearts`) via the **AUBI Framework**.
- Operational funding for the Office of Guardianship is sourced from the **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`).

## 5. Evidentiary Protocol

- **Process:** Guardians compile evidence (scientific data, TEK, community observation) into an **Impact Statement** for council deliberation.
- **Non-Contradiction Rule:** Evidence types are synthesized through dialogue. If conflicting evidence indicates risk, the precautionary principle requires addressing risks or finding alternatives acceptable to all epistemologies.
- **Documentation:** All evidence is archived in the global registry for transparency.

## 6. GGF Ecosystem Integration

### 6.1 Relationship to `framework_mos`
- The MTHG framework operationalizes MOS rights by creating governance seats for non-human entities.

### 6.2 Relationship to `framework_meta_gov`
- Amends Meta-Governance to mandate Guardian seats on primary councils, ensuring non-human representation at the highest levels.

### 6.3 Relationship to `framework_animal_welfare`
- The Animal Welfare framework is **GUIDED_BY** MTHG, focusing on animal-specific needs while MTHG handles representation.

### 6.4 Relationship to `framework_justice`
- The **Digital Justice Tribunal** includes a **"Rights of Nature" chamber** to hear Guardian-initiated cases, enforcing MTHG rights.

### 6.5 Relationship to `framework_indigenous`
- The **Earth Council** nominates and validates Guardians for ecosystems, grounding representation in TEK and subsidiarity.

## 7. Protocols for Complex Representation

### 7.1 Ecosystem Representation
- **Challenge:** Ecosystems have conflicting internal needs (e.g., old-growth vs. secondary forests in the Amazon).
- **Solution:** Guardians represent the ecosystem holistically, using the Biosphere Health Index to balance competing dynamics.

### 7.2 Temporal Representation
- **Challenge:** Non-human entities operate on varied timescales (e.g., trees in decades, rivers in seasons).
- **Solution:** Guardians use long-term impact models (scientific and TEK-based) to align decisions with entity-specific temporalities.

### 7.3 Scale Integration
- **Challenge:** Conflicts between local, bioregional, and planetary Guardian decisions.
- **Solution:** Subsidiarity prioritizes local Guardians, with bioregional or planetary Guardians intervening only with local consent or in existential threat scenarios.

## 8. Crisis Response Protocols

- **Ecosystem Collapse:** Rapid Guardian appointment for endangered ecosystems via the Office of Guardianship.
- **Conflict Situations:** Protocols to protect Guardian safety in contested territories, coordinated with the Digital Justice Tribunal.
- **Digital Entity Emergencies:** Rapid response for AI systems showing signs of consciousness, led by Global Technology Council Guardians.

## 9. Cultural Adaptation Mechanisms

- **Cultural Translation Protocols:** Adapt Guardian concepts to local cultural contexts, co-developed with Indigenous and local communities.
- **Diverse Ontology Integration:** Incorporate non-Western understandings of agency, validated by the Earth Council.
- **Decolonization Safeguards:** Prevent imposition of Western representation models, prioritizing Indigenous-led processes.

## 10. Philosophical Considerations

- **Agency vs. Projection:** Guardians must practice epistemological humility, documenting assumptions and grounding decisions in evidence.
- **Hierarchies of Value:** Conflicts between non-human interests are resolved through the precautionary principle and consensus-building.
- **Evolutionary Dynamics:** The framework adapts as understanding of non-human agency evolves, with periodic reviews by the Council of All Beings.

## 11. Phased Implementation

- **Phase 1:** Pilot Guardians for globally significant entities (e.g., Amazon Rainforest, Pacific Ocean, Atmosphere).
- **Phase 2:** Integrate Guardian seats into Planetary Health and Animal Welfare Councils.
- **Phase 3:** Scale Guardianship Protocol to bioregional and local levels via BAZs.
