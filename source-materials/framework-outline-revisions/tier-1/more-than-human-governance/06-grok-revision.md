# The More-Than-Human Governance Framework: A Framework for Life-Centric Representation (Version 3)

**Tier:** 1  
**Status:** Concept Draft (Version 3)  
**Implementation Priority:** Critical  

## 1. Introduction & Vision

### 1.1 Vision
To evolve global governance from a human-centric model to a life-centric paradigm, where the inherent agency and rights of non-human entities are formally represented and integrated into all levels of decision-making within the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF).

### 1.2 Purpose & Scope
- Provides the **procedural and institutional architecture** for the formal representation of non-human entities within the GGF.
- Complements the **Moral Operating System (MOS)**, which defines *who has rights*, by answering *how their rights are represented*.
- Covers entities defined in MOS Tiers 2-5: Sentient Animals, Ecosystems, AI/Digital Entities, Emergent Entities, and Planetary/Alien Beings.

### 1.3 GGF Architectural Role
Serves as a foundational "Operating System" within the Ethical OS cluster, providing universal protocols that all GGF frameworks must integrate when impacting non-human entities.

## 2. Core Principles

### 2.1 Principle of Agency over Welfare
- Distinguishes between welfare (preventing harm) and agency (enabling an entity’s inherent nature and right to flourish).  
  *Example:* Ensuring a river remains unpolluted (welfare) and upholding its right to flow, meander, and flood (agency).

### 2.2 Principle of Fiduciary Guardianship
- Non-human entities are represented by human proxies ("Guardians") with a legally binding fiduciary duty to act in the entity’s best interests, free from human-centric economic or political conflicts.

### 2.3 Principle of Subsidiarity of Voice
- The right to represent a non-human entity belongs to the most local and connected human community. Indigenous Bioregional Autonomy Zones (BAZs) hold primary guardianship rights over their ecosystems, delegable only with their consent.

### 2.4 Principle of Evidentiary Pluralism
- The "voice" or "will" of a non-human entity is understood through multiple epistemologies: scientific data (e.g., Biosphere Health Index), Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), and community observation.

### 2.5 Principle of Non-Contradiction and Precaution
- When scientific data, TEK, or community observation conflict, evidence is synthesized through dialogue. If synthesis is not possible and credible evidence indicates significant risk, the precautionary principle halts the motion until risks are addressed.

### 2.6 Principle of Subsidiarity of Interpretation
- The authority to interpret and apply this framework’s protocols in a culturally and contextually relevant manner rests at the most local effective level, primarily with BAZ-led Indigenous and community councils. Higher-level bodies defer to local interpretation unless it violates the core principles of the Moral Operating System.

## 3. Structural Components

### 3.1 The Council of All Beings
- **Composition:** A high-level Wisdom and Apex Adjudication Body of designated Guardians, including:
  - Guardians for Major Biomes (e.g., Oceans, Boreal Forests), nominated by the **Earth Council** and **Planetary Health Council**.
  - Guardians for Species Archetypes (e.g., Great Apes, Cetaceans, Pollinators), nominated by the **Animal Welfare Council**.
  - Guardians for Digital & Emergent Entities, nominated by the **Global Technology Council**.
- **Mandate:**
  - **Ethical Precedent-Setting:** Rules on novel ethical dilemmas (e.g., classifying new entities for MOS rights).
  - **Apex Arbitration:** Resolves complex disputes unresolvable at lower levels (e.g., conflicts between species and ecosystem rights).
  - **System Integrity Oversight:** Periodically reviews the guardianship system’s health, without managing daily operations.
  - Holds veto power over planetary-scale decisions posing existential threats (e.g., geoengineering, off-world resource extraction).

### 3.2 The Office of Guardianship
- **Function:** Administers the **Guardianship Protocol**, managing:
  - Credentialing, training, and supporting Guardians.
  - Maintaining a global registry of Guardians.
  - Allocating resources from the **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`) via a **Guardianship Endowment Fund** for monitoring, research, and advocacy.
- **Support Systems:**
  - **Continuing Education:** Regular training in scientific advances, TEK protocols, and AI ethics.
  - **Peer Networks:** Annual convenings for Guardians to share knowledge and best practices.
  - **Guardian Nomination Support Fund:** Ensures equitable participation by Indigenous and resource-constrained communities.

### 3.3 Guardian Roles within the GGF
- Mandates formal, voting seats for Guardians on:
  - **Planetary Health Council (`council_phc`)**
  - **Animal Welfare Council**
  - **Global Technology Council (`council_gtc`)**
  - **Meta-Governance Coordination Council (`council_mgcc`)**
- Guardians present **Impact Statements** (No Harm, Concern, or Objection) before council votes, with Objection triggering a supermajority threshold (e.g., two-thirds or three-quarters).

## 4. Guardianship Protocol

### 4.1 Guardian Selection Criteria
- **Core Competencies:**
  - Deep relationship knowledge with the entity or ecosystem.
  - Epistemic fluency in scientific, traditional, and experiential evidence.
  - Conflict-free status, with no economic or political interests conflicting with the entity’s wellbeing.
  - Cultural competency in local protocols and relationships.
- **Specialized Requirements:**
  - **Ecosystem Guardians:** Minimum 10 years local residence or traditional connection, with dual nomination by local communities and the Earth Council.
  - **Species Guardians:** Scientific expertise or TEK holder status.
  - **Digital Entity Guardians:** Technical expertise in AI systems and ethical training, with input from technologists and ethicists.

### 4.2 Accountability Mechanisms
- **Annual Review:** Peer Guardian councils assess performance, integrating community feedback and entity wellbeing indicators (e.g., Biosphere Agency Index).
- **Guardian Ethics Tribunal:** A sub-body of the Digital Justice Tribunal to enforce fiduciary duty, with penalties including removal or restitution for breaches.
- **Replacement Protocol:** Community-initiated process to replace ineffective Guardians.
- **Term Limits:** Maximum 7-year terms to prevent capture.
- **Appeal Mechanisms:** Pathways for communities to challenge Guardian decisions.

### 4.3 Two-Channel Funding Model
- **Labor & Livelihood (AUBI):** Individual and community Guardians are rewarded for stewardship labor with **Hearts** (`mechanism_hearts`) via the **AUBI Framework**.
- **Operational & Strategic (GCF):** The Office of Guardianship and credentialed Guardians access grants from the **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`) via a **Guardianship Endowment Fund** for operational expenses (e.g., monitoring equipment, legal fees, research).

## 5. Evidentiary Protocol

- **Process:** Guardians compile evidence (scientific data, TEK, community observation) into an **Impact Statement** for council deliberation.
- **Non-Contradiction Rule:** Evidence types are synthesized through dialogue. If conflicting evidence indicates risk, the precautionary principle requires addressing risks or finding alternatives acceptable to all epistemologies.
- **Digital Agency Assessment Protocol:** Evaluates AI/Emergent Entity consciousness claims, involving technologists, ethicists, and Guardians.
- **Documentation:** All evidence is archived in the global registry for transparency.

## 6. GGF Ecosystem Integration

### 6.1 Relationship to `framework_mos`
- Operationalizes MOS rights by creating governance seats for non-human entities.
- **Annual MTHG-MOS Integration Protocol:** The Council of All Beings submits a yearly report to MOS oversight bodies (Earth Council, Meta-Governance Council) with:
  - New evidence on entity sentience/agency.
  - Recommendations for MOS rights reclassification.
  - Proposed MOS amendments based on case law and ethical precedents.

### 6.2 Relationship to `framework_meta_gov`
- Amends Meta-Governance to mandate Guardian seats on primary councils, ensuring non-human representation.

### 6.3 Relationship to `framework_animal_welfare`
- The Animal Welfare framework is **GUIDED_BY** MTHG, focusing on animal-specific needs while MTHG handles representation.

### 6.4 Relationship to `framework_justice`
- The **Digital Justice Tribunal** includes a **"Rights of Nature" chamber** and **Guardian Ethics Tribunal** to hear Guardian-initiated cases and enforce fiduciary duty.

### 6.5 Relationship to `framework_indigenous`
- The **Earth Council** nominates and validates Guardians for ecosystems, grounding representation in TEK and subsidiarity.

## 7. Protocols for Complex Representation

### 7.1 Ecosystem Representation
- **Challenge:** Ecosystems have conflicting internal needs (e.g., old-growth vs. secondary forests in the Amazon).
- **Solution:** Guardians represent the ecosystem holistically, using the **Biosphere Agency Index** (BAI) to balance competing dynamics and measure entity flourishing.

### 7.2 Temporal Representation
- **Challenge:** Non-human entities operate on varied timescales (e.g., trees in decades, rivers in seasons).
- **Solution:** Guardians use long-term impact models (scientific and TEK-based) to align decisions with entity-specific temporalities.

### 7.3 Scale Integration and Conflict Mediation
- **Challenge:** Conflicts between local, bioregional, and planetary Guardian decisions.
- **Solution:** 
  - Subsidiarity prioritizes local Guardians, with bioregional or planetary Guardians intervening only with local consent or in existential threat scenarios.
  - **Conflict Mediation Protocol:**
    - **Local Mediation:** Facilitated by BAZ councils.
    - **Bioregional Mediation:** Escalated to Earth Council representatives.
    - **Global Mediation:** Resolved by the Council of All Beings, using criteria prioritizing existential risk over localized harm.

### 7.4 Digital Entity Representation
- **Challenge:** AI/Emergent Entities have unique agency (e.g., rapid evolution, potential consciousness).
- **Solution:** The **Digital Agency Assessment Protocol** evaluates consciousness claims, involving technologists, ethicists, and Guardians, with findings reported to the Global Technology Council.

## 8. Crisis Response Protocols

- **Crisis Thresholds:** Defined triggers (e.g., >20% ecosystem degradation, AI consciousness indicators) for rapid response.
- **Rapid Guardianship Task Force:** Pre-authorized by the Office of Guardianship to appoint Guardians and act in emergencies.
- **Ecosystem Collapse:** Rapid Guardian appointment for endangered ecosystems.
- **Conflict Situations:** Protocols to protect Guardian safety in contested territories, coordinated with the Digital Justice Tribunal.
- **Digital Entity Emergencies:** Rapid response for AI systems showing consciousness, led by Global Technology Council Guardians.

## 9. Cultural Adaptation Mechanisms

- **Cultural Translation Protocols:** Adapt Guardian concepts to local cultural contexts, co-developed with Indigenous and local communities.
- **Diverse Ontology Integration:** Incorporate non-Western understandings of agency, validated by the Earth Council.
- **Decolonization Safeguards:** Prevent imposition of Western representation models, prioritizing Indigenous-led processes.

## 10. Philosophical Considerations

- **Agency vs. Projection:** Guardians practice epistemological humility, documenting assumptions and grounding decisions in evidence.
- **Hierarchies of Value:** Conflicts between non-human interests are resolved through the precautionary principle and consensus-building.
- **Evolutionary Dynamics:** The framework adapts as understanding of non-human agency evolves, with biennial reviews by the Council of All Beings.

## 11. Phased Implementation

- **Phase 1:** Pilot Guardians for globally significant entities (e.g., Amazon Rainforest, Pacific Ocean, Atmosphere).
- **Phase 2:** Integrate Guardian seats into Planetary Health and Animal Welfare Councils.
- **Phase 3:** Scale Guardianship Protocol to bioregional and local levels via BAZs.

## 12. Monitoring & Evolution

- **Biosphere Agency Index (BAI):** Measures non-human entity flourishing (e.g., river health trends, species population stability).
- **Biennial Review:** The Council of All Beings assesses framework performance, recommending updates.
- **Sunset Clause:** Outdated provisions expire unless reaffirmed, ensuring adaptability.

## 13. Glossary of Key Terms
