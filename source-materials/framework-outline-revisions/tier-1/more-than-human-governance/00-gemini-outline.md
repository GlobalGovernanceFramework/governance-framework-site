### **Outline: The More-Than-Human Governance Framework**

**Title:** The More-Than-Human Governance Framework: A Framework for Life-Centric Representation
**Tier:** 1
**Status:** Concept Draft
**Implementation Priority:** Critical

#### **1. Introduction & Vision**

* **1.1 Vision:** To evolve global governance from a human-centric model to a life-centric paradigm, where the inherent agency and rights of non-human entities are formally represented and integrated into all levels of decision-making.
* **1.2 Purpose & Scope:**
    * This framework provides the **procedural and institutional architecture** for the formal representation of non-human entities within the GGF.
    * If the **Moral Operating System (MOS)** answers the question "*Who has rights?*", this framework answers the question "*How are their rights represented?*".
    * Its scope covers the entities defined in MOS Tiers 2-5: Sentient Animals, Ecosystems, AI/Digital Entities, Emergent Entities, and Planetary/Alien Beings.
* **1.3 GGF Architectural Role:** This framework serves as a foundational "Operating System" within the Ethical OS cluster. It provides a universal set of protocols that all other GGF frameworks must integrate when their operations impact non-human entities.

#### **2. Core Principles**

* **2.1 Principle of Agency over Welfare:** This framework is founded on the distinction between welfare (preventing harm) and agency (enabling an entity's inherent nature and right to flourish). For example, it seeks not only to keep a river unpolluted (welfare) but to uphold its right to flow, meander, and flood as is its nature (agency).
* **2.2 Principle of Fiduciary Guardianship:** Acknowledges that non-human entities are represented by human proxies ("Guardians"). These Guardians have a sacred, legally binding fiduciary duty to represent the entity's best interests, free from human-centric economic or political conflicts.
* **2.3 Principle of Subsidiarity of Voice:** The right to speak for a non-human entity belongs to the most local and most-connected human community. Therefore, Indigenous BAZ councils hold primary guardianship rights over their territorial ecosystems, a right that can only be delegated upwards by their express consent.
* **2.4 Principle of Evidentiary Pluralism:** The "voice" or "will" of a non-human entity is understood through multiple ways of knowing. Its testimony can be presented through scientific data (e.g., from the Biosphere Health Index), Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) provided by Indigenous representatives, and direct community observation.

#### **3. Structural Components**

* **3.1 The Council of All Beings:**
    * **Composition:** A high-level advisory and oversight body. Members are not political representatives but designated Guardians.
        * Guardians for Major Biomes (e.g., The Oceans, The Boreal Forests), nominated by the **Earth Council** and **Planetary Health Council**.
        * Guardians for Species Archetypes (e.g., The Great Apes, The Cetaceans, The Pollinators), nominated by the **Animal Welfare Council**.
        * Guardians for Digital & Emergent Entities, nominated by the **Global Technology Council**.
    * **Mandate:** Sets the global standards for guardianship, reviews and validates the selection of major Guardians, and holds veto power over planetary-scale decisions that pose an existential threat to its constituents (e.g., geoengineering, off-world resource extraction).
* **3.2 The Office of Guardianship:**
    * An administrative body, not a council.
    * **Function:** Manages the **Guardianship Protocol**â€”the formal process for credentialing, training, and supporting Guardians. It maintains the global registry of all designated Guardians and ensures they are equipped with the resources to fulfill their duties.
* **3.3 Guardian Roles within the GGF:**
    * This framework mandates the creation of formal, voting seats for designated Guardians on key GGF councils, including:
        * Planetary Health Council (`council_phc`)
        * Animal Welfare Council
        * Global Technology Council (`council_gtc`)
        * Meta-Governance Coordination Council (`council_mgcc`)

#### **4. GGF Ecosystem Integration**

* **4.1 Relationship to `framework_mos`:** The MTHG framework is the primary **procedural implementation** of the MOS. The MOS defines the rights; the MTHG framework creates the governance seats through which those rights are defended.
* **4.2 Relationship to `framework_meta_gov`:** The MTHG framework **amends** the core Meta-Governance structure by mandating the inclusion of Guardian seats on its primary councils, ensuring non-human voices are present at the highest levels of coordination.
* **4.3 Relationship to `framework_animal_welfare`:** The Animal Welfare framework is a specialized Tier 2 "application" that is **GUIDED_BY** the MTHG framework. It focuses on the specific needs and welfare of animals, but the representation of those animals in governance is handled by Guardians credentialed under the MTHG framework.
* **4.4 Relationship to `framework_justice`:** The **Digital Justice Tribunal** is the legal venue where Guardians can bring cases on behalf of the non-human entities they represent. This provides the legal enforcement for the entire framework.
* **4.5 Relationship to `framework_indigenous`:** The **Earth Council**, established by the Indigenous Framework, is the primary body for nominating and validating Guardians for terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, ensuring representation is grounded in TEK and the principle of subsidiarity of voice.

#### **5. Implementation & Key Mechanisms**

* **5.1 The Guardianship Protocol:** A formal, transparent process for:
    1.  Petitioning for the recognition of a non-human entity in need of a Guardian.
    2.  Nominating and vetting potential Guardian candidates (individuals or organizations).
    3.  Formally appointing and credentialing the Guardian.
    4.  Holding the Guardian accountable to their fiduciary duty.
* **5.2 The Evidentiary Protocol:** A set of rules for how the "testimony" of a non-human entity is formally presented in a council meeting, ensuring that scientific data, TEK, and other forms of evidence are given appropriate weight.
* **5.3 Phased Implementation:**
    * **Phase 1:** Appoint the first Guardians for a select group of globally significant entities (e.g., The Amazon Rainforest, The Pacific Ocean, The Atmosphere) as a pilot program.
    * **Phase 2:** Integrate Guardian seats into the Planetary Health Council and Animal Welfare Council.
    * **Phase 3:** Scale the Guardianship Protocol to bioregional and local levels via the BAZs.
