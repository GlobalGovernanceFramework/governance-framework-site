Of course. This is the key architectural task—migrating your rich, detailed content into the new, more accessible structure. A complete mapping will make this process clear and straightforward.

The goal is to take the content from each of the 37 sections outlined in your old framework (as seen in `index.md` and detailed in files like `31-grok-revision.md`) and place it within the new, four-part structure proposed by Claude.

Here is a complete mapping to guide the reorganization.

### **Content Migration Map: From Old Sections to New Structure**

This guide shows where the content from your old section numbers should be moved to populate the new, restructured framework (`34-grok-revision.md`).

#### **PART I: FOUNDATIONS**
*This part establishes the "Why" and "What" of the framework.*

* **New Section 1: Framework Overview**
    * **Salvage Content From:**
        * Old Section 0: `Preamble`
        * Old Section 1: `Introduction`
    * **Action:** Combine the poetic `Preamble` and the detailed `Introduction` to create a powerful opening that sets the stage and explains the "Golden Triangle" integration.

* **New Section 2: Theoretical Foundation**
    * **Salvage Content From:**
        * Old Section 2: `Core Peace & Conflict Resolution Principles`
        * Old Section 3: `Developmental Value Systems & Peace`
    * **Action:** Synthesize these sections to explicitly lay out the theoretical underpinnings—Values-Based Theory, Spiral Dynamics, Power Dynamics, etc.

* **New Section 3: Governance Architecture**
    * **Salvage Content From:**
        * Old Section 8: `Institutional Architecture`
    * **Action:** Move the detailed descriptions of the Global Peace Council, Regional Hubs, and other bodies here.

#### **PART II: OPERATIONAL FRAMEWORK**

* **New Section 4: Prevention & Early Warning**
    * **Salvage Content From:**
        * Old Section 21: `Structural Conflict Prevention`
        * The parts of your old scale-based documents (`local-implementation.md`, etc.) that deal with prevention and early warning.
* **New Section 5: Active Conflict Resolution**
    * **Salvage Content From:**
        * This section will be the new home for the core of your old scale-based documents (`local-implementation.md`, `regional-implementation.md`, etc.), reframed to focus on the *process* of resolution.
* **New Section 6: Post-Conflict Transformation**
    * **Salvage Content From:**
        * Old Section 14: `Transitional Justice & Reconciliation`
* **New Section 7: Scale-Specific Applications**

        * Old Section 5, 6, 7: `Local`, `Regional`, and `Global Conflict Resolution`
        * Old Section 11: `Climate & Resource Conflicts`
        * Old Section 17-20: Actor-specific sections (`Non-State Actors`, `Military`, etc.)
    * **Action:** This section becomes a library of case studies and specific application notes for different scales and conflict types.

#### **PART III: IMPLEMENTATION**
*This part is for those setting up the systems: trainers, technologists, and adapters.*
