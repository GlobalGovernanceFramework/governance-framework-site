Thank you, that clarification is extremely helpful. My apologies for the misunderstanding. I now understand completely: you want a prioritized list of tools and guides to develop specifically for the newly restructured **Peace & Conflict Resolution framework**, distinguishing between what is feasible now versus what can be planned for the future.

You are right to focus on this. A great framework becomes truly powerful when it's supported by practical tools that help people understand and apply it. Your existing pattern of creating an "at-a-glance" document and a "skeptic's summary" is excellent. We can adapt that pattern for this specific framework.

Given that your time and resources are focused on the core architectural work, the strategy should be to create a **minimal set of high-leverage tools now** that make the framework's most unique concepts usable, while outlining a more ambitious roadmap for the future.

### **Tools & Guides to Create Now (The Practitioner's Starter Pack)**

These tools can be created by extracting and reformatting content that already exists in your new framework draft (`34-grok-revision.md`). They provide a complete introductory package for any mediator, community leader, or policymaker interested in your approach.

#### **1. The P&CR Framework At-a-Glance**
This is the essential one-page summary. It's the "front door" to the entire framework.
* **Content:** A visual flowchart showing the four main parts (Foundations → Operations → Implementation → Deployment). Include a brief summary of the core principle: "Transforming conflict by addressing the clashing values at its root." List the key GGF integrations (MOS, Treaty, etc.) to show its place in the ecosystem.
* **Purpose:** To provide a quick, memorable overview of the framework's structure and philosophy.

#### **2. The Values-Based Diagnostic Toolkit**
This is the most unique, practical tool of your framework. It helps people apply your core methodology.
* **Content:** A simple, downloadable 3-page PDF:
    1.  **Page 1: A Guide to Diagnosing Values.** A short explanation of how to listen for the core values (or *vMemes*) in a conflict, using the glossary from your appendix.
    2.  **Page 2: The Values Mapping Worksheet.** A simple worksheet where a facilitator can map the parties in a conflict and the primary values (e.g., Purple-Tradition, Blue-Fairness, Green-Inclusion) they are expressing.
    3.  **Page 3: Key Diagnostic Questions.** A list of powerful, open-ended questions for a mediator to use, such as: "What does 'fairness' look like for you in this situation?", "What sacred tradition is at risk here?", "What does a successful future that honors all of our values look like?"
* **Purpose:** To give practitioners a tangible tool to start using the values-based methodology immediately.

#### **3. The Tiered Intervention Reference Card**
A concise, double-sided "cheat sheet" for mediators.
* **Content:**
    * **Side A:** Summarizes the **Tier 1 (Survival)** strategies (Tradition, Power, Fairness, Progress) and, crucially, lists the **Contraindication Criteria** for each (e.g., "Do not use 'Tradition' if community trust is below 70%").
    * **Side B:** Summarizes the **Tier 2 (Community)** and **Tier 3 (Visionary)** strategies (Inclusion, Systems, Unity, etc.).
* **Purpose:** To be a quick, in-the-field reference for a facilitator to help them choose the right intervention for the right value system.

### **Tools & Guides for the Future (As the Organization Grows)**

This is the roadmap for more resource-intensive tools that will require a dedicated team, funding, and collaboration with experts.

* **The Complete Facilitator's Implementation Playbook:**
    * A comprehensive, multi-module training manual based on **Part III: Implementation** of your framework. It would include detailed lesson plans for the 120-hour "Visionary Steward" training, role-playing scenarios, and ethical case studies.

* **The Interactive Digital Diagnostic Tool:**
    * The AI-chatbot and diagnostic platform mentioned in your framework (`Section 5: Diagnosing Values`). This would be a major software development project to help practitioners analyze conflicts in real-time.

* **The Cultural Adaptation Playbook:**
    * The detailed guide mentioned in **Section 11**, co-created with regional partners. It would provide specific guidance for applying the framework in contexts like "Ubuntu," "Sulh," and with various Indigenous nations, going far beyond the glossary.

* **The "Success Story" Case Study Repository:**
    * A curated, in-depth library of documented case studies showing how the framework was successfully applied, building on the **Success Story Repository** and **Mediation Case Study Template** ideas from your draft.

This tiered approach allows you to create a highly valuable and complete **"Practitioner's Starter Pack"** right now, using content you've already developed, while clearly and ambitiously outlining the path for future development.
