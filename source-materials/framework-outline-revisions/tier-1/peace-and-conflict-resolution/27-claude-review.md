Excellent revisions! The framework has been significantly strengthened. Here are my thoughts on the improvements and some additional suggestions:

## Major Improvements

**Enhanced Cultural Sensitivity**: The addition of region-specific value frameworks ("Ubuntu," "Sulh," "Dharma," "Samaj") and the commitment to co-creation with local practitioners addresses my earlier concerns about Western bias. This is a substantial improvement.

**Strengthened Implementation Details**: 
- The increased training hours (40-120 vs. 20-60) are much more realistic for the complexity required
- The dynamic assessment protocols and 3-month update cycles show sophisticated understanding of how values evolve
- The clear contraindication criteria with assessment thresholds (70% trust, 80% consensus) provide needed precision

**Better Technology Balance**: The low-tech fallbacks and offline protocols address the digital divide concerns effectively. The paper-based diagnostics and in-person dialogue circles ensure accessibility.

**Clearer GCRSD Integration**: The 30% spiritual influence threshold for referrals and the interfaith complexity protocols provide much-needed clarity about when and how spiritual approaches are engaged.

## Remaining Questions and Suggestions

### 1. Power Dynamics and Oppression
Your addition of MOS rights audits is good, but I'd suggest:
- **Clearer escalation protocols**: What happens when "tradition" is used to justify gender-based violence or caste discrimination? How quickly can MOS protections override cultural practices?
- **Community safety measures**: How do you protect individuals who challenge oppressive traditions during values mapping or mediation?

### 2. Scale Transition Mechanisms
The bridging from local to systemic is improved, but consider:
- **Pattern recognition across cases**: How do you identify when multiple local conflicts indicate systemic issues requiring structural intervention?
- **Policy feedback loops**: More specific mechanisms for how local mediation outcomes inform higher-level policy changes

### 3. Values Assessment Refinement

**Mixed-Values Scenarios**: The decision trees are helpful, but real conflicts often involve:
- **Competing interpretations** of the same value (e.g., different views of what "fairness" means)
- **Generational differences** within the same community about value priorities
- **Evolving values** during the conflict process itself

Consider adding protocols for:
- Intra-value conflicts (competing definitions of fairness)
- Age-stratified values mapping to understand generational tensions
- Real-time values monitoring during extended mediation processes

### 4. Measurement and Success Metrics

**Values Transformation Indicators**: Beyond the LMCI improvements, consider developing:
- **Values Integration Index**: Measuring how well parties integrate multiple values rather than choosing between them
- **Conflict Prevention Quotient**: Tracking how values-based interventions reduce future conflicts in the same communities
- **Cultural Resilience Metrics**: Assessing whether mediation strengthens or weakens cultural practices

### 5. Practitioner Ethics and Boundaries

**Facilitator Positioning**: With increased cultural literacy requirements:
- **Role clarity**: When does a facilitator's cultural knowledge become advocacy for particular values?
- **Conflict of values**: How do facilitators handle situations where their own deeply held values conflict with effective mediation?
- **Cultural authority**: What protocols govern non-Indigenous facilitators working with Indigenous value systems?

### 6. Integration Tensions

**Framework Coordination**: With such extensive GGF integration:
- **Jurisdictional clarity**: More specific protocols for when Indigenous sovereignty trumps other GGF frameworks
- **Resource competition**: How do you handle situations where AUBI resources, MOS protections, and Indigenous rights create competing demands?
- **Timeline mismatches**: Different GGF frameworks may operate on different timescales - how do you coordinate when urgent conflict resolution conflicts with longer-term institutional development?

## Technical Suggestions

### Enhanced Risk Mitigation
Add protocols for:
- **Mediator bias detection**: Regular peer review and community feedback systems
- **Cultural appropriation prevention**: Clear guidelines about which cultural practices can be adapted vs. those that must remain community-specific
- **Value system evolution**: How to handle communities whose values are rapidly changing due to external pressures

### Improved Documentation
Consider developing:
- **Cultural adaptation playbook**: Detailed guidance for adapting the framework in different cultural contexts
- **Conflict typology matrix**: Mapping different conflict types to optimal intervention strategies
- **Success story repository**: Documented cases showing how values-based approaches succeeded where traditional methods failed

## Strategic Considerations

**Pilot Implementation Priority**: I'd recommend prioritizing pilots in contexts where:
1. Multiple value systems coexist (urban multicultural settings)
2. Traditional and modern governance overlap (Indigenous communities with external pressures)
3. Rapid social change is creating values conflicts (post-conflict societies, climate-stressed regions)

**Scaling Strategy**: Consider a "values-based conflict prevention network" that connects local practitioners globally, enabling rapid sharing of innovations and cultural adaptations.

## Final Assessment

This revised framework represents a sophisticated evolution that addresses most of my earlier concerns. The integration of cultural specificity with systematic rigor is particularly impressive. The framework now demonstrates genuine respect for diverse knowledge systems while maintaining analytical coherence.

The increased training requirements and cultural literacy focus suggest you understand the complexity of implementation. The technology fallbacks show practical wisdom about diverse global contexts.

My remaining concerns are primarily about edge cases and implementation details rather than fundamental design issues. This framework is ready for careful pilot testing in diverse contexts.

The timeframe still seems ambitious, but the phased approach and cultural adaptation protocols provide flexibility for organic development. I'd encourage starting with 2-3 very different cultural contexts to test the adaptation mechanisms before broader scaling.

Overall, this is now a genuinely innovative contribution to conflict resolution that could advance both theory and practice in the field. The values-based approach, properly implemented, could help address some of the persistent failures in conventional peacebuilding approaches.
