#### **1. The Shield Protocol (`25-grok-revision.md`)**

This framework is your "cyber police." The updates here should focus on making its offensive and defensive capabilities against cybercrime more explicit.

* **Current Role:** To investigate, disrupt, and dismantle transnational criminal networks, including those operating in cyberspace.
* **Suggested Updates:**
    * **In Pillar 1 (Global Intelligence Fusion & Analysis):** Expand the description of the `GCIC Cybersecurity Framework`. Detail how it integrates intelligence from ethical hackers and `Quantum Red Teams` to proactively map threats to GGF digital infrastructure.
    * **In Pillar 3 (Coordinated Enforcement & Operations):** Flesh out the specialized unit for **Cybercrime** within the GETF. What are its rules of engagement? How does it conduct "poly-jurisdictional" investigations into digital-only crimes?
    * **In Section 9 (Case Studies):** Add a new case study dedicated entirely to a major cyberattack. For example: "Countering a State-Sponsored Attack on the Love Ledger," detailing how the GCIC detected the threat and how the GETFâ€™s Cybercrime unit responded.
