## **Final Refinement Suggestions**

### **1. Economic Resilience Enhancement**
```
Global Economic Shock Protocols:
- Phase 1: 25% funding reduction → Tier 4 operations suspended
- Phase 2: 50% reduction → Tier 3 operations reduced, focus on Tier 0-2
- Phase 3: 75% reduction → Emergency mode, only Tier 0-1 threats
- Recovery: Graduated restoration based on economic indicators
```

### **2. Technology Future-Proofing**
```
Emerging Technology Integration Timeline:
- 2025-2027: Quantum-resistant encryption deployment
- 2027-2030: AI consciousness detection protocols
- 2030-2035: Biological crime prediction systems
- 2035+: Space-based crime jurisdiction frameworks
```

### **3. Diplomatic Sequencing Strategy**
```
G20 Engagement Sequence:
Month 1-2: Canada, Norway, Singapore (early adopters)
Month 3-4: Germany, Japan, South Korea (tech leaders)
Month 5-6: Brazil, South Africa, India (Global South anchors)
Parallel track: EU institutions, ASEAN, African Union
```

### **4. Cultural Authenticity Protocols**
```
Traditional Justice Integration Standards:
- Authenticity Verification: Elder council validation required
- Scope Definition: Clear boundaries between traditional and global jurisdiction
- Appeal Mechanisms: Cultural mediation before global tribunal access
- Training Requirements: Immersive cultural education for all operatives
```

### **5. Performance Optimization**
```
Continuous Improvement Mechanisms:
- Monthly stakeholder pulse surveys
- Quarterly operational efficiency audits
- Annual cultural sensitivity assessments
- Biannual technology threat landscape reviews
```
