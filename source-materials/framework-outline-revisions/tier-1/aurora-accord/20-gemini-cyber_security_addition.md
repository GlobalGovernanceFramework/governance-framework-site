#### **2. The Aurora Accord (`18-grok-revision.md`)**

This is your "digital building code." The updates should focus on hardening the standards that prevent vulnerabilities.

* **Current Role:** To set the global standards for data security, privacy, and sovereignty.
* **Suggested Updates:**
    * **In Section 5.1 (The Data Fiduciary Standard):** Add a mandatory **"Cybersecurity Resilience Audit"** as a non-negotiable requirement for any entity to achieve certification. This audit would test against common attack vectors.
    * **In Section 5.8 (Crisis and Emergency Data Protocols):** Add a specific sub-protocol titled **"Data Sovereignty Under Digital Siege."** This would outline how data is partitioned, locked down, and access rights are temporarily frozen during a large-scale, confirmed cyberattack on GGF infrastructure to prevent data exfiltration.
    * **In Appendix 11 (Technical Appendix):** Create a new, more detailed section called **"The GGF Minimum Viable Security Stack."** This would list the specific, mandatory technologies all GGF-compliant systems must use (e.g., quantum-resistant encryption algorithms, decentralized identifiers (DIDs) for authentication, etc.).
