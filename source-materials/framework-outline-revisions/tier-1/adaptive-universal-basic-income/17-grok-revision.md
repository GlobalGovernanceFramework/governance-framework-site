## 1. Executive Summary
- **Vision:** To establish a global social safety net ensuring economic security while rewarding contributions to community wellbeing, ecological health, and personal development, fostering a flourishing society as measured by the Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI) and aligned with STR-206 and the "Treaty for Our Only Home."
- **Approach:** AUBI evolves traditional UBI with a dynamic, multi-layered payout system: a universal, locally-adjusted baseline, adaptive bonuses for contributions, and equity-based supplements, leveraging Treaty mechanisms.
- **Goals:** Reduce poverty, validate unpaid care and community work, promote lifelong learning, incentivize ecological stewardship, and foster equitable, resilient societies optimized for LMCI outcomes.
- **Key Features:**
  - Three-tiered payout structure with negative adjustments (max 50%) for harmful activities.
  - Diversified financing via automation, resource taxes, Commons Dividends, and Hearts currency, with failure switch to Hearts.
  - Holistic Support Framework with Flourishing Guides trained to support LMCI-aligned activities.
  - Treaty integration (Global Forensic Corps, Ethical Infrastructure, Reform Accelerator Labs, Foresight Labs, Office of the Adversary).
  - Cultural Adaptation Module with Decolonial Oversight Council and red team audits.
  - LMCI with validation studies, cultural weighting, and comparison to GNH/Better Life Index.
  - Failure recovery protocols for inflation, political backlash, or fiat collapse, with multi-region failure response.
  - Youth civic internships and gamified LMCI onboarding.
  - Public AI feedback dashboard, "AUBI for Humanity" narrative, and AUBI-LMCI flowchart.
  - Political economy strategies for elite capture prevention and stakeholder engagement.
  - Long-term vision for Universal Earth Service integration.
- **Risks:** Gaming of contributions, digital divide, capital flight, work disincentives, cultural conflicts, elite capture, mitigated through safeguards, audits, phased rollouts, and modeling.
- **Failure Recovery Example:** Inflation >10% in a pilot triggers baseline-only payouts, temporary wealth tax, Reform Accelerator Lab review within 60 days, and potential Hearts currency switch.

## 2. Introduction: The Philosophy of Adaptive Income
### 2.1. A Foundation for a Meaningful Existence
- AUBI ensures economic security for self-determination, unlocking potential for innovation, community building, and cultural development, aligned with STR-206.
- **Meaningful Existence Defined:** A state where individuals have:
  - **Economic Security:** Freedom from survival anxiety (unconditional baseline income).
  - **Autonomy:** Capacity to make life-shaping choices without coercion.
  - **Purpose:** Engagement in valued activities (care, ecology, culture).
  - **Recognition:** Social validation of contributions via Layer 2 bonuses.
- Historical inspirations: Alaska Permanent Fund, Brazil’s Bolsa Família, Finland’s UBI pilot (2017-2018), adapted for global scalability.

### 2.2. AUBI vs. Traditional UBI: Key Distinctions
- AUBI integrates with a pluralistic economy and Treaty pillars (P1-P5), addressing work disincentive critiques through voluntary bonuses and LMCI-tracked engagement.

| Feature | Traditional UBI | Adaptive UBI (AUBI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payout** | Fixed, flat-rate | Dynamic, multi-layered, locally-adjusted |
| **Conditionality**| Strictly unconditional | Unconditional **baseline**, voluntary adaptive bonuses |
| **Goal** | Economic floor | Floor **and** regenerative activities, flourishing society (LMCI) |
| **System** | Fiat-based policy | Treaty-integrated, pluralistic economy |

### 2.3. The Guiding Compass: The Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)
- AUBI provides the economic foundation for security and freedom, enabling a flourishing society. The **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)** replaces GDP, measuring societal success through love (care, relationships), meaning (purpose, personal growth), and connection (community, ecological harmony). AUBI is the engine for economic security; LMCI is the compass for human flourishing. Success is measured by nationwide increases in LMCI scores, validated against GNH and OECD Better Life Index.
- **Transition Considerations:** LMCI complements traditional economic indicators (e.g., GDP, unemployment) during rollout to ensure economic stability, with annual reports showing correlations between LMCI improvements and productivity.

## 3. Treaty Integration: Dependency Matrix
- AUBI leverages Treaty mechanisms, with Experimental Zones as Treaty pilot locations.

| **AUBI Component** | **Treaty Pillar** | **Mechanism** |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Financing | P4 (Planetary Health) | Carbon pricing, resource taxes, Sovereignty Bargains |
| Verification | P2 (Global Forensic Corps) | Fraud prevention, adversarial testing |
| Implementation | P1 (Reform Accelerator Labs) | Pilot testing, iterative improvement |
| Equity & Ethics | P5 (Ethical Infrastructure, Foresight Labs) | Cultural adaptation, spiritual care, scenario planning |
| Governance | P3 (Humanitarian Stability) | Conflict zone adaptation, participatory audits |
| Stress-Testing | P5 (Office of the Adversary) | Simulates misuse, cultural conflict scenarios |

## 4. The AUBI Payout Architecture
Three integrated layers ensure security, contributions, and equity, with robust safeguards.

### 4.1. Layer 1: The Universal Baseline
- **Purpose:** Guarantees a basic standard of living for all adults, ensuring dignity.
- **Calculation:**
  - Unconditional for all citizens and permanent residents (including youth post-education).
  - Adjusted via regional price indices (housing, food, utilities), updated via Reform Accelerator Labs.
- **Safeguards:** Global Arbitration Panel resolves disputes; AI-Mediated Impact Simulations model inflation risks.
- **Youth Provisions:** Baseline eligibility starts post-secondary education (age 18), with education stipends bridging the gap. Optional youth civic internships (ages 16-18) for early Layer 2 contributions.

### 4.2. Layer 2: The Contribution & Development Bonus (Adaptive)
- **Purpose:** Recognizes contributions to the commons, aligned with LMCI pillars (love, meaning, connection) and P5.
- **Mechanism:** Supplementary amount for verified contributions; negative adjustments for harmful activities (max 50% reduction to preserve dignity).
- **Recognized Contribution Categories (Aligned with LMCI):**
  - **Fostering Love:** Community care, mentorship, integration, relational development support.
  - **Cultivating Meaning:** Knowledge sharing, cultural preservation, spiritual care (including secular mindfulness), personal development guidance.
  - **Strengthening Connection:** Environmental conservation, community service, sustainable transport.
- **Youth Civic Internships:** Optional program for 16-18-year-olds to contribute (e.g., community service, environmental projects), earning small bonuses and gamified LMCI onboarding.
- **Meaning Score Pilot:** Experimental metric for emotional wellbeing contributions (STR-206), validated using:
  - OECD Better Life Index (security).
  - WHO autonomy metrics (choice capacity).
  - GNH (Gross National Happiness) for purpose/recognition.
- **Balancing Mechanisms:**
  - **Negative Adjustments:** Applied for verified harmful activities (e.g., environmental violations, disinformation).
    - **Evidence Thresholds:** Documented proof (e.g., environmental fines, legal convictions) confirmed by Global Forensic Corps.
    - **Process:** Transparent review by Global Forensic Corps, appealable via Global Arbitration Panel within 30 days. Dispute types (e.g., environmental vs. social harm) have tailored review timelines (15-45 days).
    - **Scale:** 10-50% bonus reduction for 3-6 months; repeat offenses trigger Governance Review (P5 Office of the Adversary).
    - **Examples:** Pollution (20% reduction), disinformation campaigns (30% reduction).
  - **Anti-Gaming Mechanisms:** AI-driven anomaly detection, randomized community audits, Treaty’s Whistleblower Visas for validators facing repression.
  - **Elite Capture Prevention:** Caps on Layer 2 bonuses for high-income individuals, community validation to prevent undue influence.
- **Work Incentive Measures:** Bonuses tied to contributions (e.g., 10 hours/week care work = 20% bonus increase), with LMCI tracking love, meaning, and connection.

### 4.3. Layer 3: The Equity & Needs-Based Bonus (Targeted)
- **Purpose:** Addresses systemic inequities, prioritizing marginalized populations.
- **Mechanism:** Supplements based on verified factors:
  - Health conditions and disabilities (aligned with existing disability support systems).
  - Family care responsibilities.
  - Age-related needs.
  - Geographic cost-of-living differences.
- **Inclusivity Enhancements:** Prioritizes low-income regions, conflict zones (P3), and migrant populations with portable LMCI scores across Treaty states.
- **Safeguards:** Qualitative Participatory Audits ensure fairness; privacy protections for digital verification.
- **Decolonial Oversight Council:** Advises on verification and contribution scoring in Indigenous and post-colonial regions to prevent cultural imposition.

## 5. Financing and Economic Sustainability
Diversified, Treaty-aligned financing with robust economic modeling.

### 5.1. Primary Revenue Sources
1. **Automation Tax:** Progressive tax on AI and automated production, phased in over 5 years, enforced via Treaty’s P4 Global Taxation System audits.
2. **Resource & Environmental Taxes:** Fees on resource extraction, land value tax, data extraction, carbon pricing (P4).
3. **Financial Transaction Taxes:** Levies on speculation and trading.
4. **Commons Dividends:** Revenue from shared resources (e.g., public data commons).
5. **Hearts Currency System:** Optional payouts enable participation in global care economy, funding regenerative projects, or accessing Treaty services; failure switch to Hearts if fiat systems destabilize.
   - **Exchange Rate Mechanism:** Treaty-aligned rates based on global care economy benchmarks, updated quarterly.
   - **Cross-Border Compatibility:** Hearts interoperable across Treaty states, with fiat conversion for non-Treaty states via P4 oversight.
   - **Inflation Protection:** Pegged to a basket of regenerative assets (e.g., renewable energy credits).

### 5.2. Systemic Savings
- Reduces costs of welfare systems, healthcare, crime; improves education outcomes.
- **Transition Pathway:** 5-year phase-out of welfare programs:
  - Year 1: Map overlapping programs, redirect funds to AUBI pilots.
  - Years 2-4: Gradual reduction, retrain welfare staff as Flourishing Guides.
  - Year 5: Full integration, monitored by Reform Accelerator Labs.
- **Macroeconomic Modeling:** AI-Mediated Impact Simulations predict:
  - **Optimistic Scenario:** 2-3% inflation in Year 1, mitigated by phased rollouts.
  - **Conservative Scenario:** 8-10% inflation, addressed by temporary wealth tax and baseline-only payouts.
  - **Sectoral Analysis:** Agriculture (labor retention via bonuses), services (increased demand), manufacturing (automation tax offsets).
  - **Regional Integration:** AUBI zones coordinate with non-AUBI neighbors via P4 trade agreements to prevent economic leakage.
  - **LMCI Feedback Loops:** Higher LMCI scores correlate with productivity gains (e.g., 5-10% in service sector by Year 3).

### 5.3. Capital Flight Mitigation
- Gradual tax implementation with Global Arbitration Panel dispute resolution.
- **Sovereignty Bargains (P4):** Non-compliant states lose access to Global Public Goods Fund; compliant states gain tech-sharing incentives (e.g., AI ethics labs).
- Incentives for reinvestment in AUBI Experimental Zones.

### 5.4. Failure Scenario Example
- **Scenario:** Simultaneous inflation (8-10%) and capital flight in pilot regions.
- **Response:** Trigger baseline-only payouts, temporary wealth tax (1-2% on top 1%), Reform Accelerator Lab review within 60 days, shift to Hearts currency if fiat destabilizes.

### 5.5. [Visual Description: Financing Flowchart]
- **Sankey Chart Concept:** Funds flow from revenue sources (Automation Tax [20-40% over 5 years], Resource Taxes [30%], Commons Dividends [15%], Financial Transaction Taxes [15%], Hearts Currency [10%]) into a "Global AUBI Fund." Disbursed to Universal Baseline (60%), Contribution Bonus (25%), Equity Bonus (15%). Feedback loops from AI-Mediated Impact Simulations, Participatory Audits, and regional tax collection adjust allocations. Failure switch to Hearts currency if fiat falters. Interactive dashboard visualizes real-time flows.

## 6. Implementation and Governance
### 6.1. Phased Rollout Model
- **Year-by-Year Timeline:**
  - **Year 1:** Launch pilots in 5-10 regions (e.g., Sweden, Kenya, Bangladesh), funded by Reform Impact Bonds, test LMCI validation, youth internships.
  - **Year 2:** Expand to 20 regions, integrate Layer 2 bonuses, refine verification.
  - **Years 3-4:** Scale to 50% of target populations, add Layer 3, develop legislative changes.
  - **Year 5+:** Nationwide rollout, optimized via Annual Global Institutional Reform Summit.
- **Contingency Plans:** Political backlash addressed via AUBI Patriotism campaigns; economic shocks mitigated by payout freezes and tax recalibrations.
- **Pilot Failure Protocol:** If a pilot fails (e.g., unsustainable inflation, low LMCI scores), pause expansion, shift to AUBI Lite, and conduct Foresight Lab review within 90 days.
- **Interactive Timeline Visual:** Gantt-style chart showing pilot expansion, layer integration, and legislative milestones, accessible via public AI feedback dashboard.
