My apologies. I misunderstood your request and provided an outline for the wrong framework. Thank you for the correction. It is essential that I provide accurate and relevant information based on the context you provide.

Here is the appropriate section outline for the full framework document of the **Regenerative Enterprise Framework**, based on the final revised version you have crafted (`25-grok-final_revision.md`).

This outline organizes the rich detail from your latest revision into a formal structure suitable for a comprehensive, publishable document.
