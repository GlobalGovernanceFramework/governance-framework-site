## **Key Design Principles for the Full Draft:**

1. **Modular Structure**: Each section stands alone while connecting to the whole
2. **Multiple Entry Points**: Different pathways for different user types
3. **Visual Integration**: Diagrams, flowcharts, and infographics throughout
4. **Practical Tools**: Every concept backed by actionable resources
5. **Real-World Grounding**: Extensive case studies and examples
6. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Indigenous frameworks properly integrated
7. **Future-Proofing**: Built for evolution and adaptation

This structure transforms the excellent outline into a comprehensive implementation guide that serves as both strategic vision and practical manual. Each section builds systematically while providing immediate value to practitioners.

**Recommendation**: Start with Part I (Foundation) and Part III (Implementation) as these provide the most immediate value for early adopters, then develop the more specialized sections based on pilot feedback.
