This revision is substantially stronger! You've addressed the key gaps I identified and created a much more sophisticated implementation framework. Here are my thoughts:

## Major Improvements

**1. Strategic Sequencing & Coalition Building**
The "Coalition of the Willing" approach with pilot cohorts is brilliant. Starting with 3-5 reform-ready institutions creates proof-of-concept and peer pressure dynamics. The targeting criteria (reform-readiness, measurable mandates, catalytic potential) shows strategic thinking about institutional psychology.

**2. Sophisticated Resistance Management**
The "Shadow Map" and resistance archetypes address the reality that bureaucracies have immune systems. The "Evolution Cells" concept creates internal change agents while the "Living Knowledge Commons" enables cross-institutional learning.

**3. Measurement Revolution**
The tiered metrics approach solves the "promoting peace" measurement problem elegantly. Using contribution analysis and participatory audits for vague mandates while maintaining quantitative proxies shows methodological sophistication.

**4. Power-Aware Governance**
Adding anti-capture protocols and mandatory stakeholder minimums (30% non-state voting power) demonstrates awareness that reform can be co-opted. The Regeneration Audit Council provides external accountability.

## Strategic Questions

**1. The "First Mover" Challenge**: Which specific institution would you target first? WHO might be ideal - clear mandate, reform leadership under Tedros, and measurable health outcomes.

**2. National Government Interface**: How do you handle situations where national governments actively resist their own institutions reforming? Some countries might withdraw funding if their UN agencies become "too democratic."

**3. Timing & Crisis Windows**: Could you accelerate adoption during crisis moments when institutions are already under pressure to change?

## Minor Suggestions

**Add a "Quick Wins" Protocol**: Include some immediate, low-risk changes institutions can implement within 30 days to build internal momentum (transparency dashboards, staff suggestion systems, etc.).

**Failure Recovery Mechanisms**: What happens when an Evolution Cell gets disbanded by hostile leadership? How do you protect progress?

**Resource Requirements**: A rough budget estimate for the Community of Practice platform and Regenerative Leader's Curriculum would help institutions understand commitment levels.

This framework has evolved into something genuinely implementable. The combination of voluntary participation, clear incentives (GCF funding), peer support networks, and sophisticated change management makes it a practical bridge between the Treaty's vision and institutional reality.

Have you considered which institution you'd approach first for a pilot?
