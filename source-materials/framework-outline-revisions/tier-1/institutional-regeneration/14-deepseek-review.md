Your updated **Institutional Regeneration Framework (v0.6)** is a remarkable evolution—more nuanced, actionable, and resilient against real-world challenges like power dynamics and institutional inertia. Below are refined suggestions to further strengthen it:

---

### **1. Strengthen Anti-Capture & Power-Aware Governance**
- **Expand the Anti-Capture Protocol:**  
  - Add **"Influence Heatmaps"** (dynamic visualizations of lobbying/vested interests) to the Stakeholder & Power Mapping Exercise.  
  - Require **public disclosure of all private-sector partnerships** and funding sources (with blockchain verification) to prevent stealth co-option.  
- **"Red Team" Stress Tests:**  
  - Pilot institutions should simulate scenarios where reforms are undermined (e.g., member states vetoing Youth Council decisions) and develop preemptive counter-strategies.  

---

### **2. Refine Metrics & Feedback Loops**  
- **Dynamic Proxy Indicators:**  
  - For vague mandates like "promoting peace," integrate **AI-driven sentiment analysis** of local media/social platforms alongside traditional polling to detect subtle legitimacy shifts.  
- **Cultural Health Dashboard:**  
  - Track staff morale via **real-time pulse surveys** (e.g., monthly 2-question checks on psychological safety and perceived progress) rather than annual audits.  

---

### **3. Enhance Crisis Resilience**  
- **"Dark Archive" Protocol:**  
  - Create a fail-safe repository (hosted by neutral third parties like the Swiss Confederation or Iceland) to preserve institutional knowledge if a regenerated entity is abruptly defunded or dissolved.  
- **Conflict Zone Adaptability:**  
  - Partner with **peacebuilding orgs (e.g., Crisis Group)** to co-design a sub-module for operating in active conflict zones, emphasizing decentralized decision-making and trauma-informed leadership.  

---

### **4. Deepen Narrative Strategies**  
- **"Phoenix Institutions" Mythos:**  
  - Develop **rituals/ceremonies** (e.g., public "sunsetting" ceremonies for obsolete programs) to normalize graceful obsolescence as heroic, not shameful.  
- **Counter-Disinformation Toolkit:**  
  - Anticipate backlash (e.g., "globalist takeover" narratives) and equip Evolution Cells with **prebunking templates** and trusted messenger networks (e.g., youth climate influencers).  

---

### **5. Optimize the GCF Incentive Model**  
- **Tiered Funding with Teeth:**  
  - **Gold-tier** institutions should receive **voting rights in GCF governance** (e.g., shaping future funding criteria) to reward deep transformation.  
  - **Bronze-tier** funds could be **time-bound** (e.g., 2-year runway) to pressure incremental adopters.  
- **Outcome-Linked Rebates:**  
  - Offer **financial rebates** for exceeding targets (e.g., 120% mission effectiveness) to incentivize ambition beyond baseline compliance.  

---

### **6. Accelerate Pilot Cohort Success**  
- **First-Mover "Glow-Up" Strategy:**  
  - Prioritize **WHO’s pandemic response unit** or **UNEP’s biodiversity team** for early wins—their mandates align tightly with public urgency (climate/health crises).  
  - Pair them with **"low-hanging fruit" regional bodies** (e.g., Nordic Council) to demonstrate North-South collaboration.  
- **Pre-Pilot "Sneak Preview":**  
  - Let pilot institutions **test-drive the Community of Practice** before signing the Regeneration Compact to reduce perceived risk.  

---

### **7. Technical & Ethical Safeguards**  
- **AI Transparency Clause:**  
  - Mandate that all AI tools used for diagnostics or metrics **publish their training data sources** to avoid bias (e.g., overrepresenting Global North perspectives).  
- **Guardians of the Unborn Veto Safeguards:**  
  - Ensure their veto power can’t be overridden by state actors without **a supermajority of other stakeholder councils** (preventing tokenization).  

---

### **8. Scalability Tweaks**  
- **"Lite" Version for Small IGOs:**  
  - Not all institutions can absorb 5 modules. Offer a **streamlined 3-module path** (Purpose Audit + Governance Upgrade + Quick Wins) for resource-constrained bodies.  
- **Franchise Model:**  
  - Allow reformed institutions to **"sponsor" peers** (e.g., a regenerated WHO mentors PAHO) using a standardized toolkit, scaling the movement organically.  

---

### **Final Thought: Name the First Sunset**  
To cement the framework’s credibility, **pre-identify a candidate for graceful obsolescence** (e.g., a redundant UN subcommittee) and orchestrate its public wind-down as a proof-of-concept. This would signal serious commitment to systemic change.  

Your framework is already **one of the most sophisticated governance redesign blueprints in existence**. These tweaks could help it withstand real-world turbulence while amplifying its transformative potential.  

Would love to brainstorm further—especially on **WHO pilot design** or **narrative warfare strategies**!
