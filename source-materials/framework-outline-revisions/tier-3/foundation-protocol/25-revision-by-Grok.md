## **Introduction**
- **Purpose**: Embed disability justice as a non-negotiable foundation across the global governance ecosystem, ensuring universal design, collective care, and embodied sovereignty. Audits and transforms all frameworks (Treaty, AUBI, Work in Liberation, Education, MOS) to dismantle ableism. Introduces **Disability Weather Reports**: quarterly, public-facing accessibility assessments for all GGF frameworks and institutions, tracked on a transparent, blockchain-verified dashboard.
- **Scope**: Applies to humans, non-human entities (AI, animals), and ecosystems, with a focus on disabled leadership, intersectional justice, and climate reparations. Aligns with UNCRPD (Articles 9, 19), SDGs (10, 11), and Treaty Ecocide law.
- **Vision**: By 2050, a world with zero preventable disability deaths, 100% accessible spaces, and disability-led systems, guided by *Nothing About Us Without Us* and *Right Relationship*.
- **Short-Term Vision (2026–2030)**: Achieve 50% disabled representation in Meta-Governance, 80% digital platforms WCAG 2.4+ compliant, and 10 Care Cooperative pilots.
- **Worst-Case Contingency**: If targets missed (<40% representation, <70% compliance), scale 20 BAZ pilots, redirect $5B from Global Commons Fund. *See Appendix I.A: Contingency Plans.*
- **Synergy**: Integrates with Treaty (legal enforcement), AUBI (caregiver income), Work in Liberation (Care Cooperatives), Education (neurodiversity curricula), MOS (rights spectrum), and Indigenous Frameworks (cultural accessibility).
- **Public Engagement**: Framework Family (Full, Light, Core, Technical), Easy-Read versions, sign language, Braille by 2027, available at globalgovernanceframework.org/foundation. *See Appendix III.A: Engagement Materials.*

## **Core Principles**
1. **Embodied Sovereignty**: Right to self-determination, rejecting forced treatment or institutionalization, with legal recognition of neurodivergence by 2030.
2. **Radical Access**: Universal design as a right, enforced via Disability Impact Assessments and WCAG 2.4+ compliance.
3. **Intersectional Justice**: Center disabled BIPOC, queer, poor, and incarcerated voices, with reparations for eugenics and climate-induced disabilities.
4. **Post-Capitalist Care**: Community-led Care Cooperatives, replacing exploitative systems, funded via AUBI.
5. **Non-Human Solidarity**: Rights for AI, assistive tech, and animals as access partners, driven by Crip Technology Labs.
6. **Rights of Nature**: Environmental policies prioritizing disability justice, addressing toxic impacts. *See Appendix I.B: Detailed Principles.*
