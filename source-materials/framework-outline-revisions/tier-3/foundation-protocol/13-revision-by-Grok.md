# Executive Summary
The *Radical Disability Rights & Inclusion in Global Governance Framework* reimagines global systems through disability justice, centering disabled leadership to dismantle ableism and build universal design, collective care, and embodied sovereignty. Key innovations include the Global Disability Assembly (GDA) with veto power, Access Ombuds Network enforcing universal design, Crip Technoscience Labs for disabled-led innovation, Care Cooperatives for community-led care, and an "Ableism Tax" to fund reparations. The framework integrates intersectional justice, climate reparations, and AI ethics, with phased implementation (2025–2050) targeting zero preventable disability deaths and 100% accessible public spaces by 2040. A "Framework Light" version aligns with UNCRPD for initial adoption, supported by pilot projects and coalition-building with UN bodies.

## 1. Vision
- **Title**: *Nothing About Us Without Us – A Liberated Future for All Bodies and Minds*
- **Goal**: Reimagine global governance through disability justice, intersectional solidarity, and post-capitalist access.
- **Core Approach**: Center disabled leadership to dismantle ableist systems and build universal design, collective care, and embodied sovereignty.
- **Rights of Nature Intersection**: Recognize that toxic environments (e.g., pollution, climate disasters) disproportionately harm disabled bodies, integrating ecological health into disability justice with climate reparations for affected communities.
- **Visual Aid**: 
  - **Diagram Prompt**: A circular infographic with "Disabled Leadership" at the center, radiating to six segments (Embodied Sovereignty, Radical Access, Intersectional Justice, Post-Capitalist Care, Non-Human Solidarity, Rights of Nature), each with icons (e.g., wheelchair for access, tree for nature).
  - **Visual Toolkit**: Draft SVGs/mockups available at [repository link placeholder] for advocacy toolkits, including a downloadable Framework Summary Infographic for schools and campaigns.

## 2. Core Principles
1. **Embodied Sovereignty**
   - Right to self-determination, including refusal of forced treatment or institutionalization.
   - Legal recognition of neurodivergence, chronic illness, and madness as valid ways of being, achieved through UNCRPD reforms to depathologize conditions like schizophrenia in global health policies by 2030.
2. **Radical Access**
   - Mandate universal design in all infrastructure, digital spaces, and governance systems, adhering to standards like WCAG 2.2+ for digital platforms by 2030.
   - "Access as a Human Right" Protocol: No policy valid unless co-created with disabled communities.
3. **Intersectional Disability Justice**
   - Center disabled BIPOC, queer, poor, and incarcerated voices in all decisions.
   - Reparations for eugenics, forced sterilization, institutional violence, and climate-induced disabilities.
4. **Post-Capitalist Care Ecosystems**
   - Replace exploitative care systems with community-led mutual aid networks.
   - Global Care Income: Guaranteed livelihood for caregivers and disabled people, funded by reallocating institutional budgets and an "Ableism Tax."
5. **Non-Human & Post-Human Solidarity**
   - Rights for AI, assistive tech, and service animals as partners in access.
   - "Crip Technoscience": Disabled-led innovation in biotech, AI, and adaptive design.
6. **Rights of Nature**
   - Advocate for environmental policies that prioritize disability justice (e.g., reducing pollution impacting chronic illnesses).

## 3. Structural Components
1. **Global Disability Assembly (GDA)**
   - **Composition**: Disabled elders, youth, activists (50% from Global South), "Nothing About Us Without Us" Councils in every nation, AI observers trained on disability justice principles.
   - **Powers**: Veto over policies violating disability rights, control over accessibility funds.
   - **AI Accountability**: AI observers report to disabled-led oversight boards, with annual transparency reports on decision-making inputs. Non-compliant AI developers face sanctions, including license revocation, based on audits using methodologies like ISO/IEC 30107 for bias detection.
   - **Coalition-Building**: Partner with UN bodies (e.g., WHO, UNESCO) to integrate GDA into existing disability rights mechanisms by 2027.
   - **Visual Aid**: 
     - **Diagram Prompt**: A flowchart showing GDA structure: central GDA node branching to regional councils, national/local councils, AI observers, and oversight boards, with arrows for veto and fund allocation.
2. **Access Ombuds Network**
   - **Role**: "Access Ombuds" enforce universal design through audits, with authority to close inaccessible physical/digital spaces or impose reparative fines via Universal Design Courts, with rulings livestreamed for public transparency.
   - **Transitional Approach**: Pilot audits in high-traffic urban centers (e.g., public transit hubs) to refine enforcement models by 2028.
   - **Enforcement**: Graduated ladder (warnings, fines, closures) with appeals to an International Disability Rights Tribunal; peer review by GDA councils ensures accountability.
   - **Visual Aid**: 
     - **Prompt**: A workflow diagram: "Identify Inaccessibility" → "Audit" → "Court Ruling (Livestreamed)" → "Remediation or Fine" → "Appeal to Tribunal."
3. **Abolition of Ableist Systems**
   - Close all institutions through phased deinstitutionalization pilots (e.g., redirect 20% of institutional budgets to community care by 2028), funded by reallocating healthcare budgets ($200B in US alone) and an "Ableism Tax" on non-compliant corporations. Hybrid models (e.g., small-scale supported living) ease transitions.
   - Ban forced treatments (e.g., involuntary commitment, ABA therapy) by 2030, with restorative alternatives like peer-led therapy networks.
   - End subminimum wages; mandate pay equity for disabled workers by 2027.
   - **Prison Abolition**: Dismantle carceral systems, prioritizing decarceration of disabled individuals through community-based restorative justice by 2035.
4. **Crip Technoscience Labs**
   - Disabled-led R&D hubs for open-source prosthetics, augmentative tech, AI communication tools, and emerging technologies like brain-computer interfaces, partnering with open-source accessibility toolkits.
   - Support "Biohacking for Liberation" (e.g., DIY wheelchair repairs, neural interface design).
   - **Data Sovereignty**: Ensure disabled people’s data privacy through GDPR-compliant protocols and decentralized storage systems.
5. **Global Care Cooperative**
   - **Details**: Decentralized care network with paid caregivers, disabled-led care plans, and a "Care Contributions" system for reciprocal, non-monetary exchange, creating millions of jobs globally (e.g., 1M caregiver roles by 2035).
   - **Funding**: Financed by reallocating institutional budgets, "Ableism Tax" revenue, and international grants, with formulas scaling by country income levels (e.g., 2% GDP for high-income, 0.5% for low-income).
   - **Visual Aid**: 
     - **Prompt**: An infographic of a Care Cooperative network, showing nodes (caregivers, disabled individuals, community hubs) connected by arrows labeled "Care Contributions" and "Mutual Aid."

## 5. Key Mechanisms
- **Accessibility Courts**: Fast-track justice for access violations (resolving cases within 30 days), with rulings livestreamed publicly and case studies (e.g., fining non-compliant transit systems). Appeals processed by an International Disability Rights Tribunal.
- **Disability Impact Rights Assessments**: Mandatory for all policies, with templates designed by disabled communities.
- **Algorithmic Justice**: Ban discriminatory AI (e.g., emotion detection in schools/prisons, biased hiring algorithms). Protocol includes:
  - Regular audits by disabled-led tech councils using ISO/IEC 30107 and custom bias detection frameworks.
  - Public reporting of AI bias incidents.
  - Whistleblower protections for those reporting AI bias, including legal support and anonymity safeguards.
  - Community-led "Disability Justice Algorithm Ratings" to score AI systems for fairness.

## 6. Monitoring & Evaluation
- **Accessibility Metrics Framework**: 
  - Measure % of accessible public spaces, digital platforms, workplaces, and disabled people in policymaking roles (e.g., 50% of climate adaptation teams by 2030).
  - Track preventable disability deaths, reparations disbursed, and % of media with authentic disabled representation.
  - Include testimonials from reparations recipients in annual reports.
  - Data must adhere to open, privacy-respecting standards (e.g., W3C Data Privacy Vocabularies) for accessibility metrics across countries and digital systems.
- **Participatory Auditing**: Disabled-led teams conduct biennial audits, reporting to GDA, with "Crip Time" adjustments for flexible deadlines to accommodate chronic illness.
- **Accountability**: Independent oversight board reviews progress, with power to recommend sanctions for non-compliance, supported by peer review among GDA councils.

## 7. Expected Outcomes
- **Measurable**:
  - Zero preventable disability deaths (e.g., from neglect, poverty) by 2050.
  - 100% accessible public spaces by 2040.
  - 50% reduction in accessibility complaints by 2035.
  - 50% of climate adaptation teams led by disabled individuals by 2030.
- **Aspirational**:
  - Abolition of ableism as a governing logic by fostering global cultural shifts toward disability justice.
  - Universal adoption of disability-led care models, reshaping societal norms around care and interdependence.

## 8. Alignment with Global Governance
- **UN CRPD**: Framework operationalizes Articles 9 (Accessibility) and 19 (Independent Living) through GDA and Care Cooperatives. Reform UN CRPD Committee to include GDA representatives by 2030.
- **SDGs**: Advances Goal 10 (Reduced Inequalities) and Goal 11 (Sustainable Cities) via universal design and disability-led climate adaptation.
- **Coalition-Building**: Engage UN bodies (e.g., OHCHR, UNEP) to integrate framework into existing mechanisms, starting with a 2026 UN General Assembly resolution.

## 9. Language Accessibility
- **Versions Available**: Easy-read, plain language, sign language video, and tactile/Braille summaries to be developed by 2027, with annual updates. Sample Easy-Read snapshot available at [repository link placeholder].
- **Distribution**: Partner with disability advocacy networks for global dissemination, including simplified companion materials for mass audiences.

## 10. Economic Justification
- **Cost of Inaction**: Institutionalization costs governments billions annually (e.g., $200B in the US alone); poverty-related healthcare for disabled people adds further strain.
- **Cost Savings**: Universal design reduces retrofit expenses (e.g., accessible buildings save 30% over retrofits).
- **ROI**: Disability-led innovation (e.g., open-source prosthetics) drives economic growth, with markets for assistive tech projected to reach $30B by 2030.
- **Job Creation**: Care Cooperatives and Crip Technoscience Labs create millions of jobs (e.g., 1M caregiver roles by 2035).
- **Ableism Tax**: Impose fines on corporations violating accessibility laws, redirecting funds to reparations and accessibility projects.
- **Budget Projections**: 
  - Phase 0 (2025–2027): $500M globally for pilots, funded by international grants and high-income country contributions (2% GDP).
  - Phase 1 (2027–2030): $10B annually, reallocating 20% of institutional budgets and Ableism Tax revenue.
  - Phase 2–3 (2030–2050): Scale to $50B annually, with low-income countries contributing 0.5% GDP and high-income 2%.

## 11. Crisis Scenario Protocols
