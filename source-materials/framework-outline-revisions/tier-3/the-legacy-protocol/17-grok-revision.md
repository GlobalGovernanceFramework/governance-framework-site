## **Introduction**
- **Purpose**: Embed elder wisdom, agency, and dignity as a non-negotiable protocol across the global governance ecosystem, ensuring elders are architects of regenerative systems. This framework is essential to the GGF’s mission of enhancing **Public Participation & Transnational Democracy**. A governance system that sidelines the deep, temporal wisdom and lived experience of its elders is not only unjust but strategically blind. By institutionalizing elder leadership, we build a more stable, resilient, and farsighted democratic ecosystem. The *Wisdom Utilization* metric—targeting 50% of community decisions elder-influenced by 2030—ensures elders’ knowledge shapes a regenerative future.
- **Scope**: Applies to aging populations globally, with a focus on elder-led design, cultural sensitivity, climate wisdom, and disability justice. Aligns with UNCRPD, SDGs (3, 10, 11), and Treaty Ecocide law.
- **Vision**: By 2040, every elder lives with economic security, social purpose, respected voice, and full agency, contributing to regenerative economies through wisdom and leadership.
- **Short-Term Vision (2026–2030)**: Achieve 50% elder economic inclusion, 70% reduction in age discrimination, 90% healthcare access, and 50% elder representation in Meta-Governance councils.
- **Worst-Case Contingency**: If targets missed (<40% inclusion, <60% discrimination reduction), scale 20 BAZ pilots, redirect $5B from Global Commons Fund. *See Appendix I.A: Contingency Plans.*
- **Synergy**: Integrates with Treaty (legal protections), AUBI (economic security), Work in Liberation (care cooperatives), Education (youth-elder learning), MOS (rights spectrum), and Indigenous Frameworks (cultural wisdom).
- **Public Engagement**: Framework Family (Full, Light, Core, Technical), accessible formats (audio, paper, multi-modal) by 2027, available at globalgovernanceframework.org/legacy. *See Appendix III.A: Engagement Materials.*
