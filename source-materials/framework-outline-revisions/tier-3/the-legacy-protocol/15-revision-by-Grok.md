---

## **Introduction**
- **Purpose**: Embed elder wisdom, agency, and dignity as a non-negotiable protocol across the global governance ecosystem, ensuring elders are architects of regenerative systems. Audits and transforms all frameworks (Treaty, AUBI, Work in Liberation, Education, MOS) to prioritize intergenerational connection, economic security, and purpose.
- **Scope**: Applies to aging populations globally, with a focus on elder-led design, cultural sensitivity, climate wisdom, and disability justice. Aligns with UNCRPD, SDGs (3, 10, 11), and Treaty Ecocide law.
- **Vision**: By 2040, every elder lives with economic security, social purpose, respected voice, and full agency, contributing to regenerative economies through wisdom and leadership.
- **Short-Term Vision (2026–2030)**: Achieve 50% elder economic inclusion, 70% reduction in age discrimination, 90% healthcare access, and 50% elder representation in Meta-Governance councils.
- **Worst-Case Contingency**: If targets missed (<40% inclusion, <60% discrimination reduction), scale 20 BAZ pilots, redirect $5B from Global Commons Fund. *See Appendix A: Contingency Plans.*
- **Synergy**: Integrates with Treaty (legal protections), AUBI (economic security), Work in Liberation (care cooperatives), Education (youth-elder learning), MOS (rights spectrum), and Indigenous Frameworks (cultural wisdom).
- **Public Engagement**: Framework Family (Full, Light, Core, Technical), accessible formats (audio, paper, multi-modal) by 2027, available at globalgovernanceframework.org/wisdom. *See Appendix B: Engagement Materials.*

## **Core Principles**
1. **Elder Agency**: Elders lead their own support systems, with full decision-making power.
2. **Intergenerational Connection**: Foster youth-elder collaboration for mutual learning and resilience.
3. **Dignity and Purpose**: Ensure meaningful occupation and recognition of contributions.
4. **Anti-Ageism**: Eradicate discrimination through legal, cultural, and economic reforms.
5. **Climate Wisdom**: Leverage elders’ historical ecological knowledge for adaptation.
6. **Disability Justice**: Ensure accessibility for disabled elders, aligned with Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer.
7. **Cultural Sensitivity**: Honor diverse aging traditions, especially Indigenous models. *See Appendix C: Detailed Principles.*

---

## **Governance Integration**
- **Council of Elders**:
  - **Role**: High-level advisory body within Meta-Governance, providing wisdom and long-term perspective to all councils (Earth, Social Resilience, Planetary Health, etc.), with suspensive veto power on policies neglecting elder needs.
  - **Composition**: 60% elders (50% Global South, 50% women/LGBTQ+), youth representation, transparent nominations.
  - **Tools**: *Elder Wellbeing Index*, coalition-building with UN agencies, climate, and labor movements.
- **Legal Enforcement**:
  - **Digital Justice Tribunal (Treaty)**: Specialized chamber for elder rights, addressing abuse and discrimination, aligned with UNCRPD and MOS *Rights of Aging Beings Charter*.
  - **UN Special Rapporteur on Aging**: Integrated into Treaty’s human rights monitoring apparatus.
- **Economic Integration**:
  - **AUBI**: Delivers baseline income via Layer 1 ($500/month) and tailored support (healthcare, care needs) via Layer 3. Elder contributions (mentorship, caregiving, climate wisdom) logged in Love Ledger, rewarded via Layer 2 Hearts/Leaves.
  - **Care Cooperatives**: Elder-led Community Work Teams under Work in Liberation, funded via AUBI.
- **Monitoring**: *Elder Wellbeing Index* (Purpose Score, Connection Index, Agency Measure, Wisdom Utilization), blockchain-tracked via Love Ledger. *See Appendix D: Governance Details.*
