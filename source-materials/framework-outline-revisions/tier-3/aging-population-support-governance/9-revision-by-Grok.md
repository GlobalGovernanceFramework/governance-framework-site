# Enhanced Global Governance Framework for Aging Population Support

## Preamble
The aging population is a reservoir of wisdom, experience, and potential to be celebrated, not a challenge to be managed. This framework envisions aging as a vibrant life stage, where dignity, purpose, and connection are universal rights. Through adaptive economic support, meaningful engagement, and global cooperation, we aim to transform aging into a cornerstone of thriving societies. **By 2040, all nations will commit to ensuring every elder lives with security, purpose, and respect.**

## 1. Economic Security and Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) üßìüèΩüí∞
