# The Regenerative Journeys Framework (v3.2)

*Version 3.2 | GGF Tier 3 Equity & Culture Framework*

## Preamble
Travel is a timeless practice of connection, learning, and pilgrimage. While sustainable or eco-tourism aim to minimize harm, this framework envisions tourism as regenerative by design: a sacred exchange that heals communities, restores ecosystems, and fosters reciprocal relationships between guests and hosts. It explicitly addresses overtourism harms, prioritizes climate resilience, Indigenous sovereignty, equitable resource access, and decolonization, committing to net healing and reparations—actively improving ecological, cultural, and social systems while fostering community joy and well-being.

## Framework Position within the GGF
As a Tier 3 framework, **The Regenerative Journeys Framework** governs global tourism. It leverages **The Mobility Commons** (Tier 2) for infrastructure, adheres to the **Planetary Health Framework** (Tier 2) for ecological standards, and uses the **AUBI Framework** (Tier 1) for economic tools. Its cultural and ethical protocols are co-designed with and subordinate to the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework** and **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework**. It integrates with the **Social Equity Cluster** for climate migration and youth inclusion, aligns with the **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer** for inclusivity, and coordinates with the **Disaster Risk Reduction Framework** and **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework** for crisis response. *See Appendix A for a visual map of GGF connections.*

## 1. Core Principles
- **Host Sovereignty:** Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs) hold ultimate authority to define, limit, or prohibit tourism, with Indigenous communities retaining absolute veto power over sacred areas via **FPIC 2.0**.
- **Restorative Design:** Tourism must actively restore ecological, cultural, and economic systems, achieving net healing rather than mere mitigation.
- **Reciprocity & Fair Exchange:** Tourism benefits prioritize local communities and ecosystems, equitably distributing value through community consent.
- **Cultural Integrity:** Cultural exchange must be authentic, respectful, and free from commodification, with robust protections for sacred traditions.
- **Ecological & Climate Resilience:** Tourism operates within bioregional carrying capacities, respects resource constraints (e.g., water during droughts), and contributes to the **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)**.
- **Long-Term Local Stewardship:** Tourism fosters intergenerational governance, empowering local youth and communities as future stewards through training, decision-making roles, and dedicated funding.
- **Narrative Integrity:** Communities retain sovereignty over how their culture and tourism story is told, resisting erasure, romanticization, or commodification through digital or promotional channels.

## 2. The Five Pillars of Regenerative Journeys

### Pillar I: Governance Layer — The Bioregional Tourism Council
*Focus: Decentralized, community-led governance of tourism with maximum local autonomy.*
- **BAZ-Led Councils:** Each BAZ establishes a Tourism Council with representatives from local communities, hospitality workers, cultural keepers, ecological stewards, **youth councils (minimum 30% representation)**, **disability advocates**, and **informal sector workers** (e.g., street vendors, transport operators).
  - **Polycentric Participatory Selection (PPS):** Members are selected via a polycentric, participatory process (per the **Meta-Governance Framework**), combining democratic voting, stakeholder nominations (e.g., hospitality cooperatives via the **Work in Liberation Framework**), and designated seats for Indigenous and youth representatives. **Rotating leadership** prevents power consolidation.
  - **Mandate:** Sets visitor carrying capacities, approves/denies tourism projects, and enforces ethical engagement protocols.
  - **Community Veto:** Councils have rapid-response veto power for urgent decisions (e.g., halting tourism during pandemics or ecological crises).
  - **Crisis Response Protocols:** 
    - **Emergency Tourism Suspension:** Councils can halt tourism during crises (e.g., droughts, housing shortages, wildfires).
    - **Visitor Redistribution Systems:** AI-powered tools, governed by the **Technology Governance Innovation Framework (TGIF)** and audited by the **GTC’s AI Ethics Committee** for bias prevention (e.g., avoiding colonial patterns), redirect tourists from overburdened to under-visited areas. Consent is ensured via quarterly BAZ reviews, with opt-out mechanisms, **digital tools for pushback** (e.g., community feedback portals), **transparent logs of opt-outs/adjustments**, and **AI pause mechanisms** triggered by social tension scores. BAZs retain **Technology Opt-Out Rights**, allowing low-tech tourism approaches.
    - **Proactive Capacity Management:** When tourism metrics (e.g., visitor numbers, water usage) reach 80% of carrying capacity, the **Meta-Governance Council** is notified. The **Mobility as a Service (MaaS) Commons** platform and GGF-affiliated platforms cease promotional activities for the destination and highlight under-visited bioregions.
    - **Emergency Integration:** Councils co-design **Community-First Resource Allocation** (e.g., repurposing tourist amenities like pools for water storage or medical space) and **Evacuation Coordination** plans with the **Disaster Risk Reduction Framework** and **Mobility Commons**, ensuring tourism transport supports emergency evacuations. **Real-time crisis dashboards** (via **Digital Commons**, integrated with **Public Trust Dashboard**) show resource allocation to build trust.
  - **Indigenous Red Lines:** Decisions are bound by the **Indigenous Framework’s Red Lines Clause**, ensuring **FPIC 2.0** with **Three-Generation Consent** (elders, adults, youth councils) for high-impact or long-term projects.
  - **Community Data Sovereignty:** BAZs control all tourism-related data via **community-led data governance councils** (per **Aurora Accord**), with **Data Repatriation Clauses** in tech contracts to reclaim/delete data, enforced by the **Digital Justice Tribunal**.
- **Meta-Coordination:** Councils coordinate via a facilitative **Meta-Governance Framework** sub-council, evolving into a **Regenerative Tourism Assembly** to share resources (e.g., Venice’s water tech for Pacific Islands) and manage cross-bioregion tourism corridors, with safeguards against top-down control.
- **Phase 0 Enhancement:** The **Local Listening & Trust Building** phase includes **Trauma-Informed Community Engagement**, **Elder Council Authorization**, and **Cultural Impact Simulation** (using traditional knowledge to predict long-term effects), per **Indigenous Framework** protocols.

### Pillar II: Economic Layer — A Regenerative Guest Economy
*Focus: Ensuring tourism benefits enrich local communities and ecosystems with transparent, participatory systems.*
- **Dynamic Regenerative Tourism Levy:** A BAZ-adjusted levy (1-5% based on local needs, e.g., higher for fragile ecosystems) on international travel bookings, applied at booking via platforms, feeds the **Global Commons Fund** for ecological restoration, **community-controlled microgrants** for small businesses, and a **Migration Solidarity Economy** (allocating 15% in **Refuge-Receiving BAZs** to migrant housing and cultural integration). A mandatory 10% of the levy is allocated to a **BAZ Intergenerational Trust Fund** for 50+ year restoration or cultural preservation projects, co-approved by the BAZ’s **Youth Council**.
- **Guest Hearts System:** Tourists receive **Guest Hearts** (via the **AUBI Framework**) upon completing the **Global Guest Curriculum**, spendable only at locally-owned, certified-regenerative businesses. Each transaction, recorded in the **Love Ledger**, includes a digital receipt linking to a story or message from the benefiting community. An **Impact Multiplier** grants bonus Hearts for spending at high-impact businesses (e.g., Indigenous cooperatives). Tourists have **soft voting input** on three pre-vetted local projects their Hearts support, logged transparently on the **Public Trust Dashboard**. **Eco-Social Badge Tiers** (e.g., Gold/Platinum Guest Heart Spender) gamify alignment. **Restoration Quests** (e.g., tree planting, cultural workshops) and **Community Kudos** (local-awarded Hearts for exemplary tourists) enhance engagement. A **Climate Debt Ledger** offsets travel emissions via local projects (e.g., mangrove restoration). A **Transparency Dashboard** (integrated with **Public Trust Dashboard**) shows how Hearts fund local projects.
- **Economic Justice Mechanisms:**
  - **Local Ownership Requirements:** At least 60% of tourism businesses must be locally or cooperatively owned.
  - **Profit Retention Protocols:** Limits (e.g., 30%) on tourism revenue extractable by external corporations.
  - **Housing Protection Fund:** A portion of the levy funds affordable housing to prevent resident displacement and **eco-gentrification**.
  - **Youth-Led Innovation Fund:** A portfolio within the **Global Commons Fund**, co-governed by **Youth & Future Generations** councils and BAZ Tourism Councils, supports youth-designed regenerative projects (e.g., eco-guide training, cultural apps).
  - **Anti-Extractivism Safeguards:** Protections against **digital colonialism** and **cultural patent mining** are enforced by the **Digital Justice Tribunal**, with **Data Repatriation Clauses** in tech contracts.
- **Enterprise Certification:** Businesses must meet **Regenerative Enterprise Framework** standards for fair labor, ecological restoration, and community benefit.

### Pillar III: Regenerative Infrastructure & Ecology
*Focus: Infrastructure serving tourists, locals, and climate migrants while restoring ecosystems.*
- **Climate-Adaptive Infrastructure:** Tourism facilities (e.g., hotels, visitor centers) are designed with **dual-purpose requirements** to serve as emergency shelters, medical facilities, or supply distribution hubs, with **off-grid energy/water systems** for crisis resilience, managed by **Community Work Teams**.
- **Community-First & Seasonal Multi-Use Design:** Infrastructure prioritizes local needs (e.g., hotels serve as community centers off-season; tourist transport enhances local mobility via **Mobility Commons** integration) and adapts to tourism cycles. In **Managed Retreat BAZs**, facilities are converted into **artifacts of learning** (e.g., interpretive centers on climate change) or **Legacy Storytelling archives** (e.g., oral histories), managed by the **Educational Systems Framework** and BAZ councils.
- **Interspecies Justice Design:** Infrastructure incorporates **wildlife corridors**, funds **biodiversity offsets** (e.g., coral restoration for dive tours), and aligns with ecological patterns, informed by real-time **BHI** data, accessible to councils and tourists via a public interface. **Community-ethically-trained AI** (per **TGIF** and **Indigenous AI Oracles**) tracks impacts in tourism corridors, with data shared across BAZs.
- **Resource Allocation Protocols:** Tourists are restricted from excessive resource use during emergencies, ensuring community priority. **Live BHI data** (e.g., water levels, wildlife activity) is displayed to educate tourists and adjust behavior, with **Guest Hearts redemption rates** tied to BHI improvements (e.g., discounts in low-impact seasons).
- **Climate Migration Preparedness:** Infrastructure is designed to serve climate migrants (e.g., as temporary housing) and includes protocols for **managed retreat** (ethical decommissioning in uninhabitable areas), tailored to **climate vulnerability tiers** (**Refuge-Receiving**, **Managed Retreat**, **Stable**), co-developed with the **Migration & Human Mobility Framework** and **Disaster Risk Reduction Framework**.

### Pillar IV: The Sacred Journey & Cultural Exchange
*Focus: Ensuring respectful, meaningful, and safe cultural exchange.*
- **Global Guest Curriculum:** A mandatory digital module for travelers, covering regenerative travel principles and BAZ-specific protocols, co-designed with hosts. Upon completion, tourists take a voluntary **Guest Oath**, recorded in a **public ledger or badge** to foster a new tourism norm, pledging respect and alignment with regenerative principles.
- **Pilgrimage & Sacred Journey Protocols:** 
  - Co-designed with the **Indigenous Framework**, governing access to sacred sites with local guide requirements, visitor limits, **seasonal sacred closures**, or permanent closures via **living agreements** that adapt to climate/ceremonial changes. Some sites may be entirely off-limits.
  - **Pilgrimage Preparation Requirements:** Visitors to sensitive sacred sites must complete multi-month preparation processes, including **Spiritual Accountability** checks to demonstrate understanding of spiritual protocols.
  - **Anti-Commodification Safeguards:** Ban digital replication of sacred rituals (e.g., NFTs of ceremonies) and **cultural patent mining** via the **Digital Justice Tribunal** and **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework**. **Cultural Tradeoff Assessments** evaluate exchanges for cultural continuity. A **Sacred Firewall** (developed with **Cultural Heritage Framework** and **TGIF**) uses algorithmic filters to block commodification of sacred terms (e.g., rejecting “shamanic retreat” listings). **Spiritual misappropriation detection tools** and **community vetoes** for platforms using ritual-based keywords ensure narrative integrity.
- **Inclusivity Protocols:** Tourism spaces and transport undergo safety audits by the **Gender & Kinship Justice Council** and **universal design standards** co-designed with the **Global Disability Alliance (GDA)** for neurodiverse and accessible experiences.
- **Authentic Exchange Platforms:** **Digital Commons**-managed platforms connect travelers with community-led experiences (e.g., workshops, homestays, restoration projects).

### Pillar V: Accountability Layer — Measuring What Matters
*Focus: Holding tourism accountable to regenerative and decolonial promises with robust metrics.*
- **Tourism Impact Assessments (TIAs):** Mandatory for large-scale projects, measuring impacts on **BHI**, **LMCI**, and metrics visualized via a **Decolonization Scorecard** (e.g., spider chart):
  - **Cultural Continuity:** Tracks support for/harm to traditional practices, including a **local storytelling indicator**.
  - **Ecosystem Health:** Monitors biodiversity in tourism corridors via community-ethically-trained AI.
  - **Black Sky Resilience:** Assesses BAZ preparedness for low-tech tourism operation during grid failures, with protocols for repurposing tourist transport for emergencies via **Mobility Commons** and **Crisis Command Protocol**.
  - **Intergenerational Equity Score:** Tracks youth involvement and long-term benefits.
  - **Reciprocity Index:** Measures host-guest relationship quality via community surveys and narratives logged in the **Love Ledger**.
  - **Decolonization Metrics:**
    - **Indigenous Land Return Percentage:** Tracks land rematriation via **Land Sovereignty Audits**, registered with the **Digital Justice Tribunal**.
    - **Language Preservation Impact Score:** Measures tourism’s support for Indigenous language use in public spaces.
    - **Economic Sovereignty Index:** Tracks percentage of tourism revenue under local/Indigenous control.
    - **Reparations Index:** Tracks tourism’s role in addressing historical harms (e.g., levy funding Indigenous language revival, land taxes to displaced communities).
    - **Joy Indicator:** Measures community pride, cultural vibrancy, and well-being via community-led surveys, integrated into **BHI** scores.
- **Climate Migration Integration:** TIAs evaluate infrastructure support for climate migrants, tailored to **climate vulnerability tiers**, aligned with the **Migration & Human Mobility Framework**.
- **Restorative Arc Pathway:** Violations are first mediated by BAZ Councils using the **Values-Based Conflict Transformation** protocol (from the **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework**), escalating to the **Digital Justice Tribunal** if unresolved.
- **Annual BAZ Audits:** Councils publish reports on tourism’s ecological, cultural, economic, and decolonial impacts.

## 3. Implementation Sequence
1. **Phase 0: Historical Harm Audits:** Assess colonial tourism legacies to guide reparative design, per **Indigenous Framework** protocols.
2. **Phase 0.5: Local Listening & Trust Building:** Engage elders, youth, ecologists, and cultural keepers using **participatory mapping**, **Trauma-Informed Community Engagement**, **Elder Council Authorization**, and **Cultural Impact Simulation**, initiating **FPIC 2.0** in traditional territories.
