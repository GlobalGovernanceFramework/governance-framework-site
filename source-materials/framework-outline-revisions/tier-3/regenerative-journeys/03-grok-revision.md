# The Regenerative Journeys Framework (v2.1)

*Version 2.1 | GGF Tier 3 Equity & Culture Framework*

## Preamble
Travel is a timeless practice of connection, learning, and pilgrimage. Modern tourism, however, has often reduced destinations to commodities and cultures to products, leaving communities and ecosystems depleted. The Regenerative Journeys Framework reimagines tourism as a sacred exchange—a practice of temporary stewardship where guests and hosts engage in reciprocity, mutual respect, and the co-creation of a healthier, more interconnected world. It explicitly aims to heal communities harmed by overtourism, prioritizing climate resilience, Indigenous sovereignty, and equitable resource access.

## Framework Position within the GGF
As a Tier 3 framework, **The Regenerative Journeys Framework** governs global tourism. It builds on **The Mobility Commons** (Tier 2) for infrastructure, adheres to the ecological standards of the **Planetary Health Framework** (Tier 2), and leverages the economic tools of the **AUBI Framework** (Tier 1). Its cultural and ethical protocols are co-designed with and subordinate to the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework** and the **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework**. It integrates with the **Social Equity Cluster** to address climate migration and youth inclusion.

## 1. Core Principles
- **Host Sovereignty:** Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs) hold ultimate authority to define, limit, or prohibit tourism in their territories, with Indigenous communities retaining absolute veto power over sacred areas.
- **Regenerative by Design:** Tourism must actively improve ecological, cultural, and economic conditions, leaving places better than found.
- **Reciprocity & Fair Exchange:** Tourism benefits must prioritize local communities and ecosystems, with equitable distribution of value.
- **Cultural Integrity:** Cultural exchange must be authentic, respectful, and free from commodification, with strict protections for sacred traditions.
- **Ecological & Climate Resilience:** Tourism operates within bioregional carrying capacities, respects resource constraints (e.g., water during droughts), and contributes to the **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)**.
- **Indigenous Primacy:** All tourism activities in traditional territories are subject to **FPIC 2.0** and traditional ceremonial calendars.

## 2. The Five Pillars of Regenerative Journeys

### Pillar I: Governance Layer — The Bioregional Tourism Council
*Focus: Decentralized, community-led governance of tourism.*
- **BAZ-Led Councils:** Each BAZ establishes a Tourism Council with representatives from local communities, hospitality workers, cultural keepers, ecological stewards, **youth councils**, **disability advocates**, and **informal sector workers** (e.g., street vendors, transport operators).
  - **Mandate:** Sets visitor carrying capacities, approves/denies tourism projects, and enforces ethical engagement protocols.
  - **Crisis Response Protocols:** 
    - **Emergency Tourism Suspension:** Councils can halt tourism during ecological or social crises (e.g., droughts, housing shortages, wildfires).
    - **Visitor Redistribution Systems:** AI-powered tools, integrated with the **Technology Governance Innovation Framework (TGIF)**, redirect tourists from overburdened to under-visited areas with community consent.
  - **Indigenous Red Lines:** All decisions are bound by the **Indigenous Framework’s Red Lines Clause**, ensuring **FPIC 2.0** and respect for ceremonial calendars.
- **Meta-Coordination:** Councils coordinate via a **Meta-Governance Framework** sub-council to share best practices and manage cross-bioregion tourism corridors.

### Pillar II: Economic Layer — A Regenerative Guest Economy
*Focus: Ensuring tourism benefits enrich local communities and ecosystems.*
- **Regenerative Tourism Levy:** A 1-2% levy on international travel bookings feeds the **Global Commons Fund** for ecological restoration in heavily touristed areas.
- **Guest Hearts System:** Tourists purchase **Guest Hearts** (via the **AUBI Framework**), spendable only at locally-owned, certified-regenerative businesses. A portion of each purchase supports BAZ-managed commons funds.
- **Economic Justice Mechanisms:**
  - **Local Ownership Requirements:** At least 60% of tourism businesses (hotels, tours) must be locally or cooperatively owned.
  - **Profit Retention Protocols:** Limits (e.g., 30%) on tourism revenue extractable by external corporations.
  - **Housing Protection Fund:** A portion of the levy funds affordable housing to prevent resident displacement, inspired by real-world efforts like Barcelona’s 2028 short-term rental ban.
- **Enterprise Certification:** Businesses must meet **Regenerative Enterprise Framework** standards for fair labor, ecological restoration, and community benefit.

### Pillar III: Regenerative Infrastructure & Ecology
*Focus: Infrastructure serving tourists and locals while restoring ecosystems.*
- **Climate-Adaptive Infrastructure:** Tourism facilities (e.g., hotels, visitor centers) double as climate refuge shelters or emergency hubs during crises (e.g., heatwaves, floods).
- **Community-First Design:** Infrastructure prioritizes local needs (e.g., hotels serve as community centers off-season; tourist transport enhances local mobility).
- **Interspecies Justice Design:** Infrastructure incorporates **wildlife corridors** and aligns with ecological patterns, informed by real-time **BHI** data.
- **Resource Allocation Protocols:** Tourists are restricted from excessive resource use (e.g., water) during local emergencies, ensuring community priority.

### Pillar IV: The Sacred Journey & Cultural Exchange
*Focus: Ensuring respectful, meaningful, and safe cultural exchange.*
- **Global Guest Curriculum:** A mandatory digital module for travelers, covering regenerative travel principles and BAZ-specific cultural/ecological protocols, co-designed with hosts.
- **Pilgrimage & Sacred Journey Protocols:** 
  - Co-designed with the **Indigenous Framework**, these govern access to sacred sites, including local guide requirements, visitor limits, or seasonal/permanent closures.
  - Some sites may be entirely off-limits to non-community members.
- **Gender Equity & Safety Audits:** Tourism spaces and transport undergo audits by the **Gender & Kinship Justice Council** to ensure safety for women and LGBTQ+ travelers.
- **Authentic Exchange Platforms:** **Digital Commons**-managed platforms connect travelers with community-led experiences (e.g., workshops, homestays, restoration projects).

### Pillar V: Accountability Layer — Measuring What Matters
*Focus: Holding tourism accountable to regenerative promises.*
- **Tourism Impact Assessments (TIAs):** Mandatory for large-scale projects, measuring impacts on **BHI**, **LMCI**, and new metrics:
  - **Cultural Continuity:** Tracks support for/harm to traditional practices.
  - **Ecosystem Health:** Monitors biodiversity in tourism corridors.
  - **Black Sky Resilience:** Assesses BAZ preparedness for low-tech tourism operation during catastrophic grid failures.
- **Climate Migration Integration:** TIAs evaluate how tourism infrastructure can support future climate refugee communities, aligned with the **Migration & Human Mobility Framework**.
- **Annual BAZ Audits:** Councils publish reports on tourism’s ecological, cultural, and economic impacts.
- **Enforcement:** Violations (e.g., pollution, cultural disrespect) are adjudicated by the **Digital Justice Tribunal**.

## 3. Implementation Sequence
1. **Pilot in Crisis Zones:** Begin in areas facing overtourism backlash (e.g., Barcelona, Venice) to test governance and crisis protocols.
2. **Establish BAZ Tourism Councils:** Prioritize community-led governance before infrastructure development.
3. **Deploy Monitoring Systems:** Implement AI-powered carrying capacity tools and TIAs early for accountability.
4. **Scale Guest Hearts Economy:** Expand economic mechanisms once governance and monitoring are proven.
5. **Iterate with Feedback:** Use annual audits and community input to refine protocols, respecting BAZs’ right to limit or prohibit tourism.
