# The Regenerative Journeys Framework (v2.2)

*Version 2.2 | GGF Tier 3 Equity & Culture Framework*

## Preamble
Travel is a timeless practice of connection, learning, and pilgrimage. Unlike sustainable or eco-tourism, which aim to minimize harm, this framework envisions tourism as regenerative by design: a sacred exchange that heals communities, restores ecosystems, and fosters reciprocal relationships between guests and hosts. It explicitly addresses the harms of overtourism, prioritizing climate resilience, Indigenous sovereignty, and equitable resource access to co-create a healthier, interconnected world.

## Framework Position within the GGF
As a Tier 3 framework, **The Regenerative Journeys Framework** governs global tourism. It leverages **The Mobility Commons** (Tier 2) for infrastructure, adheres to the **Planetary Health Framework** (Tier 2) for ecological standards, and uses the **AUBI Framework** (Tier 1) for economic tools. Its cultural and ethical protocols are co-designed with and subordinate to the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework** and **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework**. It integrates with the **Social Equity Cluster** to support climate migration and youth inclusion, and aligns with the **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer** for inclusivity. *See Appendix A for a visual map of GGF connections.*

## 1. Core Principles
- **Host Sovereignty:** Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs) hold ultimate authority to define, limit, or prohibit tourism, with Indigenous communities retaining absolute veto power over sacred areas via **FPIC 2.0**.
- **Restorative Design:** Tourism must actively improve ecological, cultural, and economic conditions, leaving places better than found.
- **Reciprocity & Fair Exchange:** Tourism benefits prioritize local communities and ecosystems, equitably distributing value.
- **Cultural Integrity:** Cultural exchange must be authentic, respectful, and free from commodification, protecting sacred traditions.
- **Ecological & Climate Resilience:** Tourism operates within bioregional carrying capacities, respects resource constraints (e.g., water during droughts), and contributes to the **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)**.
- **Long-Term Local Stewardship:** Tourism fosters intergenerational governance, empowering local youth and communities as future stewards through training and decision-making roles.

## 2. The Five Pillars of Regenerative Journeys

### Pillar I: Governance Layer — The Bioregional Tourism Council
*Focus: Decentralized, community-led governance of tourism.*
- **BAZ-Led Councils:** Each BAZ establishes a Tourism Council with representatives from local communities, hospitality workers, cultural keepers, ecological stewards, **youth councils**, **disability advocates**, and **informal sector workers** (e.g., street vendors, transport operators).
  - **Selection Process:** Members are selected via a polycentric, participatory process (per the **Meta-Governance Framework**), combining democratic voting, stakeholder nominations (e.g., hospitality cooperatives), and designated seats for Indigenous and youth representatives.
  - **Mandate:** Sets visitor carrying capacities, approves/denies tourism projects, and enforces ethical engagement protocols.
  - **Crisis Response Protocols:** 
    - **Emergency Tourism Suspension:** Councils can halt tourism during ecological or social crises (e.g., droughts, housing shortages, wildfires).
    - **Visitor Redistribution Systems:** AI-powered tools, governed by the **Technology Governance Innovation Framework (TGIF)**, redirect tourists from overburdened to under-visited areas. Consent is ensured via quarterly BAZ reviews, with opt-out mechanisms for communities.
  - **Indigenous Red Lines:** Decisions are bound by the **Indigenous Framework’s Red Lines Clause**, ensuring **FPIC 2.0** and respect for ceremonial calendars.
- **Meta-Coordination:** Councils coordinate via a facilitative (not directive) **Meta-Governance Framework** sub-council to share best practices and manage cross-bioregion tourism corridors, with safeguards against top-down control.

### Pillar II: Economic Layer — A Regenerative Guest Economy
*Focus: Ensuring tourism benefits enrich local communities and ecosystems.*
- **Regenerative Tourism Levy:** A 1-2% levy on international travel bookings (applied at booking via platforms) feeds the **Global Commons Fund** for ecological restoration in heavily touristed areas.
- **Guest Hearts System:** Tourists receive **Guest Hearts** (via the **AUBI Framework**) upon completing the **Global Guest Curriculum**, spendable only at locally-owned, certified-regenerative businesses. Each transaction, recorded in the **Love Ledger**, includes a digital receipt linking to a story or message from the benefiting community, fostering an educational loop.
- **Economic Justice Mechanisms:**
  - **Local Ownership Requirements:** At least 60% of tourism businesses must be locally or cooperatively owned.
  - **Profit Retention Protocols:** Limits (e.g., 30%) on tourism revenue extractable by external corporations.
  - **Housing Protection Fund:** A portion of the levy funds affordable housing to prevent resident displacement, inspired by efforts like Barcelona’s 2028 short-term rental ban.
- **Enterprise Certification:** Businesses must meet **Regenerative Enterprise Framework** standards for fair labor, ecological restoration, and community benefit.

### Pillar III: Regenerative Infrastructure & Ecology
*Focus: Infrastructure serving tourists and locals while restoring ecosystems.*
- **Climate-Adaptive Infrastructure:** Tourism facilities (e.g., hotels, visitor centers) double as climate refuge shelters or emergency hubs during crises.
- **Community-First & Seasonal Multi-Use Design:** Infrastructure prioritizes local needs (e.g., hotels serve as community centers off-season; tourist transport enhances local mobility) and adapts to tourism cycles and community demands.
- **Interspecies Justice Design:** Infrastructure incorporates **wildlife corridors** and aligns with ecological patterns, informed by real-time **BHI** data, accessible to councils and tourists via a public interface.
- **Resource Allocation Protocols:** Tourists are restricted from excessive resource use during local emergencies, ensuring community priority.

### Pillar IV: The Sacred Journey & Cultural Exchange
*Focus: Ensuring respectful, meaningful, and safe cultural exchange.*
- **Global Guest Curriculum:** A mandatory digital module for travelers, covering regenerative travel principles and BAZ-specific protocols, co-designed with hosts. Upon completion, tourists take a voluntary **Guest Oath** pledging respect and alignment with regenerative principles.
- **Pilgrimage & Sacred Journey Protocols:** 
  - Co-designed with the **Indigenous Framework**, governing access to sacred sites with local guide requirements, visitor limits, or seasonal/permanent closures.
  - Some sites may be entirely off-limits to non-community members.
- **Inclusivity Protocols:** Tourism spaces and transport undergo safety audits by the **Gender & Kinship Justice Council** and neurodiverse protocols co-designed with the **Global Disability Alliance (GDA)** to ensure safety for women, LGBTQ+, and neurodiverse travelers.
- **Authentic Exchange Platforms:** **Digital Commons**-managed platforms connect travelers with community-led experiences (e.g., workshops, homestays, restoration projects).

### Pillar V: Accountability Layer — Measuring What Matters
*Focus: Holding tourism accountable to regenerative promises.*
- **Tourism Impact Assessments (TIAs):** Mandatory for large-scale projects, measuring impacts on **BHI**, **LMCI**, and new metrics:
  - **Cultural Continuity:** Tracks support for/harm to traditional practices, including a **local storytelling indicator** to monitor preservation of narratives, songs, and traditions.
  - **Ecosystem Health:** Monitors biodiversity in tourism corridors.
  - **Black Sky Resilience:** Assesses BAZ preparedness for low-tech tourism operation during grid failures.
- **Climate Migration Integration:** TIAs evaluate how tourism infrastructure supports future climate refugee communities, aligned with the **Migration & Human Mobility Framework**.
- **Remediation Pathway:** Violations (e.g., pollution, cultural disrespect) are first mediated by BAZ Councils using the **Values-Based Conflict Transformation** protocol (from the **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework**), escalating to the **Digital Justice Tribunal** only if unresolved.
- **Annual BAZ Audits:** Councils publish reports on tourism’s ecological, cultural, and economic impacts.

## 3. Implementation Sequence
