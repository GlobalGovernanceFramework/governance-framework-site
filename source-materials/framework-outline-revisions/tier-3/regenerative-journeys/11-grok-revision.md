# The Regenerative Journeys Framework (v2.4)

*Version 2.4 | GGF Tier 3 Equity & Culture Framework*

## Preamble
Travel is a timeless practice of connection, learning, and pilgrimage. Unlike sustainable or eco-tourism, which aim to minimize harm, this framework envisions tourism as regenerative by design: a sacred exchange that heals communities, restores ecosystems, and fosters reciprocal relationships between guests and hosts. It explicitly addresses overtourism harms, prioritizes climate resilience, Indigenous sovereignty, and equitable resource access, and commits to net healing—actively improving ecological, cultural, and social systems.

## Framework Position within the GGF
As a Tier 3 framework, **The Regenerative Journeys Framework** governs global tourism. It leverages **The Mobility Commons** (Tier 2) for infrastructure, adheres to the **Planetary Health Framework** (Tier 2) for ecological standards, and uses the **AUBI Framework** (Tier 1) for economic tools. Its cultural and ethical protocols are co-designed with and subordinate to the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework** and **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework**. It integrates with the **Social Equity Cluster** for climate migration and youth inclusion, and aligns with the **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer** for inclusivity. *See Appendix A for a visual map of GGF connections.*

## 1. Core Principles
- **Host Sovereignty:** Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs) hold ultimate authority to define, limit, or prohibit tourism, with Indigenous communities retaining absolute veto power over sacred areas via **FPIC 2.0**.
- **Restorative Design:** Tourism must actively restore ecological, cultural, and economic systems, achieving net healing rather than mere mitigation.
- **Reciprocity & Fair Exchange:** Tourism benefits prioritize local communities and ecosystems, equitably distributing value through community consent.
- **Cultural Integrity:** Cultural exchange must be authentic, respectful, and free from commodification, with robust protections for sacred traditions.
- **Ecological & Climate Resilience:** Tourism operates within bioregional carrying capacities, respects resource constraints (e.g., water during droughts), and contributes to the **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)**.
- **Long-Term Local Stewardship:** Tourism fosters intergenerational governance, empowering local youth and communities as future stewards through training, decision-making roles, and dedicated funding.

## 2. The Five Pillars of Regenerative Journeys

### Pillar I: Governance Layer — The Bioregional Tourism Council
*Focus: Decentralized, community-led governance of tourism with maximum local autonomy.*
- **BAZ-Led Councils:** Each BAZ establishes a Tourism Council with representatives from local communities, hospitality workers, cultural keepers, ecological stewards, **youth councils (minimum 30% representation)**, **disability advocates**, and **informal sector workers** (e.g., street vendors, transport operators).
  - **Selection Process:** Members are selected via a polycentric, participatory process (per the **Meta-Governance Framework**), combining democratic voting, stakeholder nominations (e.g., hospitality cooperatives), and designated seats for Indigenous and youth representatives. Representation for informal sector workers is facilitated through the **Work in Liberation Framework**, which supports the formation of worker-owned cooperatives (e.g., for street vendors, local guides) to nominate and select council members. **Rotating leadership** prevents power consolidation.
  - **Mandate:** Sets visitor carrying capacities, approves/denies tourism projects, and enforces ethical engagement protocols.
  - **Community Veto:** Councils have a rapid-response veto power for urgent decisions (e.g., halting tourism during pandemics or ecological crises) without bureaucratic delays.
  - **Crisis Response Protocols:** 
    - **Emergency Tourism Suspension:** Councils can halt tourism during crises (e.g., droughts, housing shortages, wildfires).
    - **Visitor Redistribution Systems:** AI-powered tools, governed by the **Technology Governance Innovation Framework (TGIF)**, redirect tourists from overburdened to under-visited areas. Consent is ensured via quarterly BAZ reviews, with opt-out mechanisms and community-led pushback protocols.
    - **Proactive Capacity Management:** When tourism metrics (e.g., visitor numbers, water usage) reach 80% of carrying capacity, the **Meta-Governance Council** is notified. The **Mobility as a Service (MaaS) Commons** platform and GGF-affiliated platforms cease promotional activities for the destination and highlight under-visited bioregions seeking visitors.
  - **Indigenous Red Lines:** Decisions are bound by the **Indigenous Framework’s Red Lines Clause**, ensuring **FPIC 2.0** and respect for ceremonial calendars, with **generational FPIC** requiring consent from both elders and youth councils for long-term projects.
- **Meta-Coordination:** Councils coordinate via a facilitative **Meta-Governance Framework** sub-council to share best practices (e.g., Venice sharing water management tools with Pacific Islands) and manage cross-bioregion tourism corridors, with safeguards against top-down control.

### Pillar II: Economic Layer — A Regenerative Guest Economy
*Focus: Ensuring tourism benefits enrich local communities and ecosystems with transparent, participatory systems.*
- **Dynamic Regenerative Tourism Levy:** A BAZ-adjusted levy (1-5% based on local needs, e.g., higher for fragile ecosystems) on international travel bookings, applied at booking via platforms, feeds the **Global Commons Fund** for ecological restoration and **community-controlled microgrants** for small businesses. A mandatory 10% of the levy is allocated to a **BAZ Intergenerational Trust Fund** for 50+ year restoration or cultural preservation projects, co-approved by the BAZ’s **Youth Council**.
- **Guest Hearts System:** Tourists receive **Guest Hearts** (via the **AUBI Framework**) upon completing the **Global Guest Curriculum**, spendable only at locally-owned, certified-regenerative businesses. Each transaction, recorded in the **Love Ledger**, includes a digital receipt linking to a story or message from the benefiting community. An **Impact Multiplier** grants bonus Hearts for spending at high-impact businesses (e.g., Indigenous cooperatives). A **Transparency Dashboard** (integrated with the **Public Trust Dashboard**) shows how Hearts fund local projects (e.g., reforestation, cultural preservation).
- **Economic Justice Mechanisms:**
  - **Local Ownership Requirements:** At least 60% of tourism businesses must be locally or cooperatively owned.
  - **Profit Retention Protocols:** Limits (e.g., 30%) on tourism revenue extractable by external corporations.
  - **Housing Protection Fund:** A portion of the levy funds affordable housing to prevent resident displacement.
  - **Youth-Led Innovation Fund:** A portfolio within the **Global Commons Fund**, co-governed by **Youth & Future Generations** councils and BAZ Tourism Councils, supports youth-designed regenerative projects (e.g., eco-guide training, cultural apps).
- **Enterprise Certification:** Businesses must meet **Regenerative Enterprise Framework** standards for fair labor, ecological restoration, and community benefit.

### Pillar III: Regenerative Infrastructure & Ecology
*Focus: Infrastructure serving tourists and locals while restoring ecosystems.*
- **Climate-Adaptive Infrastructure:** Tourism facilities (e.g., hotels, visitor centers) double as climate refuge shelters or emergency hubs, with **off-grid energy/water systems** for crisis resilience, managed by **Community Work Teams**.
- **Community-First & Seasonal Multi-Use Design:** Infrastructure prioritizes local needs (e.g., hotels serve as community centers off-season; tourist transport enhances local mobility via **Mobility Commons** integration) and adapts to tourism cycles.
- **Interspecies Justice Design:** Infrastructure incorporates **wildlife corridors**, funds **biodiversity offsets** (e.g., coral restoration for dive tours), and aligns with ecological patterns, informed by real-time **BHI** data, accessible to councils and tourists via a public interface. **AI-powered wildlife monitoring** tracks impacts in tourism corridors, with data shared across BAZs.
- **Resource Allocation Protocols:** Tourists are restricted from excessive resource use during emergencies, ensuring community priority. **Live BHI data** (e.g., water levels, wildlife activity) is displayed to educate tourists and adjust behavior, with **Guest Hearts redemption rates** tied to BHI improvements (e.g., discounts in low-impact seasons).

### Pillar IV: The Sacred Journey & Cultural Exchange
*Focus: Ensuring respectful, meaningful, and safe cultural exchange.*
- **Global Guest Curriculum:** A mandatory digital module for travelers, covering regenerative travel principles and BAZ-specific protocols, co-designed with hosts. Upon completion, tourists take a voluntary **Guest Oath** pledging respect and alignment with regenerative principles.
- **Pilgrimage & Sacred Journey Protocols:** 
  - Co-designed with the **Indigenous Framework**, governing access to sacred sites with local guide requirements, visitor limits, or seasonal/permanent closures via **living agreements** that adapt to climate/ceremonial changes.
  - Some sites may be entirely off-limits to non-community members.
  - **Anti-Commodification Safeguards:** Ban digital replication of sacred rituals (e.g., NFTs of ceremonies) via the **Digital Justice Tribunal** and **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework**. **Cultural Tradeoff Assessments** evaluate exchanges for cultural continuity.
- **Inclusivity Protocols:** Tourism spaces and transport undergo safety audits by the **Gender & Kinship Justice Council** and **universal design standards** co-designed with the **Global Disability Alliance (GDA)** for neurodiverse and accessible experiences.
- **Authentic Exchange Platforms:** **Digital Commons**-managed platforms connect travelers with community-led experiences (e.g., workshops, homestays, restoration projects).

### Pillar V: Accountability Layer — Measuring What Matters
*Focus: Holding tourism accountable to regenerative promises with robust metrics.*
- **Tourism Impact Assessments (TIAs):** Mandatory for large-scale projects, measuring impacts on **BHI**, **LMCI**, and new metrics:
  - **Cultural Continuity:** Tracks support for/harm to traditional practices, including a **local storytelling indicator** to monitor preservation of narratives, songs, and traditions.
  - **Ecosystem Health:** Monitors biodiversity in tourism corridors via AI-powered tools.
  - **Black Sky Resilience:** Assesses BAZ preparedness for low-tech tourism operation during grid failures, with protocols for repurposing tourist transport for emergencies via **Mobility Commons** and **Crisis Command Protocol**.
  - **Intergenerational Equity Score:** Tracks youth involvement and long-term benefits.
  - **Reciprocity Index:** Measures host-guest relationship quality via community surveys and narratives logged in the **Love Ledger**.
- **Climate Migration Integration:** TIAs evaluate how tourism infrastructure supports future climate refugee communities, aligned with the **Migration & Human Mobility Framework**.
- **Remediation Pathway:** Violations are first mediated by BAZ Councils using the **Values-Based Conflict Transformation** protocol (from the **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework**), escalating to the **Digital Justice Tribunal** if unresolved.
- **Annual BAZ Audits:** Councils publish reports on tourism’s ecological, cultural, and economic impacts.

## 3. Implementation Sequence
1. **Phase 0: Local Listening & Trust Building:** Engage elders, youth, ecologists, and cultural keepers per **Indigenous Framework** protocols, using **participatory mapping** to identify no-go zones and initiate **FPIC 2.0** in traditional territories.
2. **Phase 1: Pilot in Crisis Zones:** Test in areas facing overtourism (e.g., Barcelona, Venice) and **post-industrial regions** (e.g., Detroit) for economic regeneration.
3. **Phase 2: BAZ Council Formation:** Establish community-led governance with clear selection and veto processes.
4. **Phase 3: Tool & Metric Deployment:** Implement AI-powered carrying capacity tools, BHI interfaces, and TIAs.
5. **Phase 4: Guest Economy Launch:** Scale **Guest Hearts** and economic mechanisms.
6. **Phase 5: Ongoing Iteration & Care:** Use audits and community feedback to refine protocols, respecting BAZ rights to limit or prohibit tourism.
