### **Outline: The Regenerative Journeys Framework**

*Version 1.0 Outline | GGF Tier 3 Equity & Culture Framework*

---

### **Preamble**
Travel is an ancient human practice of connection, learning, and pilgrimage. For too long, modern tourism has treated destinations as commodities and cultures as products, often leaving communities and ecosystems diminished. This framework reimagines tourism as a sacred exchange—a practice of temporary stewardship where guests and hosts engage in reciprocity, mutual respect, and the co-creation of a healthier, more interconnected world.

### **Framework Position within the GGF**
As a Tier 3 framework, **The Regenerative Journeys Framework** provides the specific governance needed to manage global tourism. It relies on the infrastructure provided by **The Mobility Commons** (Tier 2), is held to the ecological standards of the **Planetary Health Framework** (Tier 2), and uses the economic tools of the **AUBI Framework** (Tier 1). Its ethical and cultural protocols are co-designed with and subordinate to the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework** and the **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework**.

### **1. Core Principles**
* **Host Sovereignty:** Local communities, especially **Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)**, have the ultimate right to define the terms, scale, and nature of tourism within their territories.
* **Regenerative by Design:** The goal of tourism is not to "leave no trace," but to leave a place better—ecologically, culturally, and economically—than it was found.
* **Reciprocity & Fair Exchange:** The value generated by tourism must be shared equitably, primarily benefiting the host community and ecosystem.
* **Cultural Integrity:** Cultural exchange must be authentic and respectful, protecting against the commodification and performance of sacred traditions.
* **Ecological Stewardship:** All tourism activities must operate within the carrying capacity of the local bioregion and contribute positively to the **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)**.

### **2. The Four Pillars of Regenerative Journeys**

#### **Pillar I: The Governance Layer — The Bioregional Tourism Council**
*Focus: Decentralized, community-led governance of tourism.*
* **BAZ-Led Councils:** Each BAZ establishes a Tourism Council with representatives from local communities, hospitality workers, cultural keepers, and ecological stewards. This council is the primary authority for tourism in the region.
* **Mandate:** The council sets local visitor carrying capacities, approves or denies proposed tourism projects (hotels, tours), and establishes protocols for ethical engagement.
* **Meta-Coordination:** These local councils coordinate through a specialized sub-council within the **Meta-Governance Framework** to share best practices and manage cross-bioregion tourism corridors.

#### **Pillar II: The Economic Layer — A Regenerative Guest Economy**
*Focus: An economic model that ensures the benefits of tourism enrich the host community.*
* **Regenerative Tourism Levy:** A global levy (e.g., 1-2%) on all international travel bookings, with proceeds flowing into the **Global Commons Fund** to finance ecological restoration in heavily touristed areas.
* **Integration with AUBI:**
    * Tourists can purchase **"Guest Hearts,"** a special form of `Hearts` that can only be spent at locally-owned, certified-regenerative businesses, ensuring money stays local.
    * A portion of every "Guest Heart" purchase is automatically allocated to a BAZ-managed commons fund for community projects.
* **Enterprise Certification:** Tourism businesses (hotels, tour operators) must be certified under the **Regenerative Enterprise Framework** to operate within a BAZ, requiring them to meet standards for fair labor, ecological restoration, and community benefit.

#### **Pillar III: The Experience Layer — The Guest-Host Protocol**
*Focus: The standards and tools for ensuring respectful and meaningful cultural exchange.*
* **The Global Guest Curriculum:** A mandatory, short, interactive digital module that all international travelers must complete before their journey. It covers the core principles of regenerative travel and provides specific cultural and ecological protocols for their destination, co-designed with the host BAZ.
* **Protocols for Sacred & Cultural Sites:** Access to sensitive sites is governed by the principles of the **Indigenous Framework** and the **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework**. This may include requiring local guides, limiting visitor numbers, or restricting access during ceremonial periods.
* **Authentic Exchange Platforms:** The framework supports platforms (managed as **Digital Commons**) that connect travelers with authentic experiences like community-led workshops, homestays, and volunteer opportunities in restoration projects.

#### **Pillar IV: The Accountability Layer — Measuring What Matters**
*Focus: Ensuring the tourism industry is held accountable to its regenerative promises.*
* **Tourism Impact Assessments (TIAs):** All new large-scale tourism projects must undergo a mandatory TIA, which measures their projected impact on the local **BHI** and the **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**.
* **Annual BAZ Audits:** Each Bioregional Tourism Council must publish an annual report detailing the ecological, cultural, and economic impacts of tourism in their region.
* **Enforcement:** Violations of tourism protocols (e.g., a hotel causing pollution, a tour operator disrespecting a sacred site) can be brought before the **Digital Justice Tribunal** by the local BAZ council for adjudication and enforcement.
