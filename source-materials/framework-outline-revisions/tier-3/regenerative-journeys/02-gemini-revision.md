### **Refined Outline: The Regenerative Journeys Framework (v2.0)**

---

**Preamble**
* *As before, but with added emphasis:* A vision of tourism as "sacred exchange" and pilgrimage, explicitly moving beyond extractive models and acknowledging the need to heal communities harmed by overtourism.

**1. Core Principles**
* *All existing principles remain.*
* **Additions based on Claude's review:**
    * **Climate Resilience & Resource Constraints:** All tourism activities must operate within the bioregion's climate reality, including limitations during emergencies like droughts or heatwaves. Tourist resource consumption must not compromise local community access.
    * **Primacy of Indigenous Sovereignty:** Indigenous communities retain the absolute right to define, limit, or prohibit tourism in their territories, with FPIC 2.0 and traditional calendars taking precedence over all tourism activities.

### **2. The Five Pillars of Regenerative Journeys (v2.0)**

#### **Pillar I: Governance & Host Sovereignty**
*Focus: The democratic and sovereign governance of tourism, led by local communities.*
* **The Bioregional Tourism Council:** The BAZ-led governance body.
    * **Enhanced Representation:** Explicitly includes seats for **youth councils**, **disability advocates**, and **informal transport/hospitality workers**.
* **Crisis Response Protocols:**
    * **Emergency Tourism Suspension:** Formal protocols allowing the Council to temporarily halt tourism during ecological or social crises (e.g., droughts, wildfires, housing shortages).
    * **Visitor Redistribution Systems:** AI-powered tools, governed by the **TGIF**, to redirect tourists from overwhelmed areas to under-visited ones, with community consent.
* **Indigenous Red Lines Integration:** The council's decisions are explicitly bound by the **Red Lines Clause** of the **Indigenous Framework**. All tourism development is subject to **FPIC 2.0**.

#### **Pillar II: The Regenerative Guest Economy**
*Focus: An economic model that ensures the benefits of tourism are regenerative and remain local.*
* **Regenerative Tourism Levy & Guest Hearts System:** *As before.*
* **Economic Justice Mechanisms:**
    * **Local Ownership Requirements:** Mandate that a minimum percentage (e.g., 60%) of tourism businesses must be locally or cooperatively owned.
    * **Profit Retention Protocols:** Establish limits on the percentage of tourism revenue that can be extracted from the BAZ by external corporations.
    * **Housing Protection Fund:** A portion of the tourism levy is dedicated to funding affordable local housing to prevent resident displacement.

#### **Pillar III: Regenerative Infrastructure & Ecology (New Pillar)**
*Focus: Physical and digital infrastructure that serves both tourists and locals while actively restoring ecosystems.*
* **Climate-Adaptive Infrastructure:** Tourism facilities (e.g., hotels, visitor centers) must be designed to double as climate refuge shelters or emergency coordination hubs during crises.
* **Community-First Design:** Infrastructure must serve community needs first. A hotel might function as a community learning center in the off-season; a tourist transport line must improve daily mobility for locals.
* **Interspecies Justice Design:** Infrastructure must integrate **wildlife corridors** and be designed around ecological patterns, informed by real-time data from the **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)**.

#### **Pillar IV: The Sacred Journey & Cultural Exchange**
*Focus: Ensuring that travel is a practice of respectful, meaningful, and safe exchange.*
* **The Guest-Host Protocol & Global Guest Curriculum:** *As before.*
* **Pilgrimage & Sacred Journey Protocols:**
    * This section will detail specific, co-designed protocols for visitors engaging in pilgrimage to sacred sites, with strict adherence to the **Indigenous Framework's** ceremonial calendars.
    * It will recognize that some sites may be permanently or seasonally off-limits to non-community members.
* **Gender Equity & Safety Audits:** All tourism spaces and transport systems must undergo safety audits by the **Gender & Kinship Justice Council** to protect women and LGBTQ+ travelers.

#### **Pillar V: Accountability & Measurement**
*Focus: Ensuring the tourism industry is held accountable to its regenerative promises.*
* **Tourism Impact Assessments (TIAs):** *As before.*
* **New Metrics:**
    * **Cultural Continuity:** Measures how tourism supports (or harms) traditional practices and ceremonial movement.
    * **Ecosystem Health:** Tracks biodiversity and resource health in tourism corridors.
    * **"Black Sky" Resilience Metric:** Measures the BAZ's preparedness for tourism to function with low-tech backups during a catastrophic grid failure.
* **Climate Migration Integration:** TIAs must assess how new tourism infrastructure can serve the needs of potential future climate refugee communities, in coordination with the **Migration & Human Mobility Framework**.
