## **Preamble: Cities as Living Covenants**
Cities are reimagined as living covenants uniting human and non-human communities, rooted in Indigenous stewardship of traditional territories. Guided by the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework**, this framework fosters regenerative, equitable, and resilient urban ecosystems within Indigenous-led Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs). Centered on the **Indigenous-Led Citizen Assembly**, it integrates with the **Golden Triangle** (**Treaty for Our Only Home**, **Financial Systems Framework**, **Aurora Accord**) to ensure biodiverse, just, and thriving cities by 2050.

**Vision**: *By 2050, cities thrive as regenerative hubs within Indigenous-led BAZs, guided by the Earth Council’s moral authority, empowered by the Treaty, sustained by Hearts and Leaves, and supported by ethical technology under the Aurora Accord, fostering participatory, bioregional democracy.*

## **Introduction**
- **Purpose**: To reimagine urban systems as regenerative, inclusive, and resilient, centered on the **Indigenous-Led Citizen Assembly** as the core of participatory, bioregional democracy. This framework integrates with the **Treaty for Our Only Home** (ecosystem rights), **Financial Systems Framework** (Hearts/Leaves, AUBI), and **Aurora Accord** (ethical AI/data governance), ensuring cities are equitable, biodiverse, and aligned with Indigenous principles.
- **Scope**: Urban and peri-urban areas within traditional territories, integrated into Indigenous-led BAZs, aligned with UN-Habitat III, Paris Agreement, and Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD). Protects human communities, urban ecosystems, wildlife, and hybrid systems (e.g., AI-monitored infrastructure).
- **Core Objectives**:
  1. **Ecosystem Rights**: Grant legal personhood to urban ecosystems by 2035 (**Treaty Pillar 1**).
  2. **Equity & Inclusion**: Ensure universal basic services, gender/queer spatial justice, and disability access, audited against **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer** and **Gender & Kinship Justice Layer**.
  3. **Regenerative Economies**: Achieve zero-waste cities via Hearts/Leaves, rooted in Indigenous stewardship.
  4. **Resilient Design**: Implement climate-adaptive, biophilic infrastructure, guided by Indigenous knowledge.
  5. **Indigenous-Led Governance**: Empower Citizen Assemblies with Indigenous co-governance, FPIC 2.0, and Red Lines Clause.
- **Worst-Case Contingency**: If global adoption stalls, leverage Indigenous-led BAZs and City Networks (C40, ICLEI) with Red Lines Clause protections.
- **Synergies**: Integrates with **Indigenous Framework** (moral authority), **Climate Framework** (urban cooling), **Animal Welfare Framework** (sanctuaries), **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer** (accessibility audits), and **Gender & Kinship Justice Layer** (inclusive spaces).

3. **Equity & Justice**: Universal basic services, gender/queer spatial justice, disability access, audited by **Disability Impact Assessment (DIA)** and **Gender & Kinship Justice Layer**.
4. **Systems Integration**: Connect housing, transport, energy, food, and wildlife systems, guided by Indigenous principles.
5. **Resilience**: Climate-adaptive, biophilic infrastructure with urban sanctuaries.
6. **Local Empowerment**: Citizen Assemblies with Indigenous co-jurisdiction and ceremonial governance.
7. **Seventh-Generation Accountability**: Model multi-generational impacts via Urban Thrivability Scorecard.
8. **Cultural Vibrancy**: Protect heritage via Cultural Vibrancy Index, rooted in Indigenous rituals.
