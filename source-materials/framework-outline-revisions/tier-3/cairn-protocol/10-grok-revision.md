### **1. Vision**

In the face of the polycrisis, humanity experiences unprecedented loss—of species, ecosystems, cultures, and stability. This collective grief, including the profound pain of ecological loss (*solastalgia*[^1]), is not a pathology to be suppressed but a sacred responsibility to be held. This framework establishes the governance, rituals, and commons to honor death as a dignified transition, process collective grief as a source of communal wisdom, and memorialize loss as a commitment to intergenerational healing. We empower communities to lead their own practices, transforming grief from a private burden into a shared, regenerative practice, weaving remembrance into the fabric of a resilient, compassionate civilization.

[^1]: *Solastalgia*: The distress caused by environmental change or loss, such as the degradation of one’s home ecosystem, often experienced as a sense of powerlessness or grief.

---

### **2. Core Principles**

1. **Grief as a Sacred Commons**: Collective grief is a shared experience and a public good, requiring communal spaces and rituals for its expression and transformation.
2. **Dignity in Transition**: Every sentient being has the right to a dignified, compassionate, and culturally appropriate end-of-life process.
3. **Ecological Kinship & Mourning**: Humanity has a sacred duty to witness, mourn, and memorialize the loss of our non-human kin and the desecration of ecosystems.
4. **Ritual Integrity & Pluralism**: Grief and memorial practices must honor the diverse wisdom of global traditions, guided by the principle of non-appropriation and deep cultural respect.
5. **Remembrance as a Regenerative Act**: Memorializing loss is a living practice that informs future action and strengthens planetary stewardship.
6. **Community-Led Empowerment**: All rituals, responses, and practices must be co-designed and led by affected communities, with resources and structures to support their sovereignty.

---

### **3. A Typology of Grief (Non-Exhaustive)**

To guide implementation and training, this framework recognizes distinct yet interconnected types of grief, informed by community input and cultural wisdom:
- **Personal Grief**: Loss of loved ones, family, or close relationships.
- **Ecological Grief**: Distress from ecosystem collapse, species extinction, or environmental degradation (e.g., solastalgia, eco-anxiety, species grief).
- **Cultural & Historical Grief**: Loss of languages, traditions, ancestral lands, or cultural identity due to colonial trauma or displacement.
- **Future Grief**: Anticipatory grief for potential losses (e.g., youth fearing climate-driven futures).
- **Unspoken Grief**: Grief not socially acknowledged, often experienced by marginalized communities (e.g., disenfranchised losses).

This typology is non-rigid, serving as a flexible guide for designing rituals, training counselors, and tailoring interventions to community needs.

---

### **4. Systemic Integration**

This Tier 3 framework is a critical component of the GGF’s cultural and health layers, deeply interconnected with core operating systems.

- **Guidance and Oversight**:
  - Guided by the foundational wisdom of `framework_indigenous` concerning ancestors and life cycles.
  - Core rituals and memorial practices overseen by the **Council for Ritual & Remembrance** (`council_crr`), a sub-council of `council_cawc`, ensuring cultural integrity via `protocol_cultural_grief` with a **Living Consent Mechanism** for dynamic community permissions.
  - The `council_earth` provides guidance for rituals addressing ecological loss, co-designed with communities to reflect local traditions.
  - **Process Protocol Renewal Ritual** (`process_protocol_renewal_ritual`): A periodic (every 5-7 years) community-led review of `protocol_dtp` and `protocol_cultural_grief` through storytelling and global reflection days, facilitated by `council_cawc`.
- **Dependencies and Collaboration**:
  - Depends on `framework_mental_health` for trauma-informed principles and **Ecological Mental Health Emergency Protocols** for acute environmental disasters.
  - Collaborates with `framework_cultural_heritage` to archive historical mourning traditions with community consent per `protocol_cultural_grief`.
  - Informs `framework_planetary_health` by providing tools to process the emotional impact of biosphere degradation measured by `metric_bhi` (Biosphere Health Index).
  - Leverages `framework_arts_flourishing` for creating memorials, rituals, and **Ancestral Offerings Archive** (e.g., poems, art, songs).
  - Integrates with `framework_biodiversity` and `framework_soil_health` to document and restore lost species/ecosystems in the **Species & Ecosystem Memorial Registry**.
  - Collaborates with `framework_drr` for **Grief First Responder** training within **Dignified Transition Protocols**.
  - Engages `framework_youth` and `framework_education` for childhood and youth grief training.
  - Uses `framework_gaian_trade`’s **Digital Product Passports** to track restorative actions linked to memorials.
  - Amplifies narratives via `framework_synoptic` and `institution_gimn`.
- **Implementation and Funding**:
  - Care, death doulaship, and ritual facilitation are rewarded with `mechanism_hearts` through `framework_aubi`.
  - **Grief Resilience Fund**, a mandated allocation within `mechanism_gcf`, supports microgrants and compensation for marginalized communities, overseen by `council_crr`.
  - `process_indigenous_healing_grants` allocates resources from `mechanism_gcf` for Indigenous-led trauma-healing initiatives, such as Intergenerational Healing Circles.
  - Place-based memorials and rituals are implemented at the bioregional level, governed by `institution_baz`.
