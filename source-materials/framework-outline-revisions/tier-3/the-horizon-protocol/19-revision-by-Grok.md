## **Opening Narrative: A Vision of Intergenerational Renewal**
In 2040, a young delegate from a Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) in a small island nation stands before the Youth Caucus of the Meta-Governance Framework, selecting delegates for the Social Resilience Council. Her community’s youth-led watershed restoration, logged as a Community Work Team in the Love Ledger, earns Hearts and Leaves via AUBI. An elder shares a Time Capsule Diplomacy letter, archived in a BAZ-managed quantum-safe platform, holding past leaders accountable. In a conflict zone, youth-led reconciliation teams, guided by Indigenous wisdom, rebuild trust. This is a world where youth and elders co-architect governance, integrated into the Treaty, AUBI, and Work in Liberation ecosystem.
