#### **3. The Digital Commons Framework (`26-revision-by-Grok.md`)**

This is your "resilient internet." The updates should focus on the survivability and integrity of the public digital infrastructure.

* **Current Role:** To manage shared digital infrastructure like open-source software and decentralized internet protocols.
* **Suggested Updates:**
    * **In Section 4.3 (Shared Digital Infrastructure):** Expand this with a sub-section on **"Infrastructure Hardening & Active Defense."** Detail how the shared `cybersecurity monitoring` works in practice. Does it use AI to detect anomalies? Who responds to them?
    * **In Appendix L (Risk Mitigation):** Make the mitigations for **"Infrastructure collapse"** and **"Sabotage"** more robust. Create a mini-playbook that outlines the exact steps for activating satellite backups or switching to mesh networks if the primary internet is compromised.
    * **Create a New Appendix: "Community-Led Resilience."** This would be a guide for how `Local Citizen Nodes` can contribute to security, for example by running small, distributed backup nodes or participating in a "digital neighborhood watch" to report suspicious activity.
