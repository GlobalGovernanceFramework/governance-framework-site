## **Introduction**
- **Purpose**: Embed gender and LGBTQ+ justice as a non-negotiable layer across the global governance ecosystem, ensuring intersectional equity, self-determination, and cultural sensitivity. This Layer is a cornerstone of the GGF’s commitment to **Public Participation & Transnational Democracy**. By ensuring that people of all genders, sexual orientations, and intersectional identities have not just a voice but institutionalized power, it transforms governance from a procedural exercise into a system of genuine, lived legitimacy for all.
- **Scope**: Applies to all gender identities, sexual orientations, and intersectional groups (race, disability, class, religion), with a focus on Global South leadership, climate justice, and data sovereignty. Aligns with UDHR (1948), CEDAW (1979), Yogyakarta Principles (2006), UNCRPD, and Treaty Ecocide law.
- **Vision**: By 2050, a world with zero gender-based discrimination, full legal recognition of all identities, and equitable economic inclusion, guided by *Nothing About Us Without Us* and *Right Relationship*.
- **Short-Term Vision (2026–2030)**: Achieve decriminalization in 80% of countries, 50% gender pay gap closure, and 50% Global South representation in Meta-Governance councils.
- **Worst-Case Contingency**: If targets missed (<70% decriminalization, <40% pay gap closure), scale 20 BAZ pilots, redirect $5B from Global Commons Fund. *See Appendix I.A: Contingency Plans.*
- **Synergy**: Integrates with Treaty (legal enforcement), AUBI (economic inclusion), Work in Liberation (labor protections), Education (anti-bias curricula), MOS (rights spectrum), and Indigenous Frameworks (cultural recognition).
- **Public Engagement**: Framework Family (Full, Light, Core, Technical), plain-language, sign language, Braille versions by 2027, available at globalgovernanceframework.org/kinship. *See Appendix III.A: Engagement Materials.*

## **Core Principles**
1. **Universal Human Rights**: Rooted in dignity, fairness, and autonomy, aligned with UDHR, CEDAW, Yogyakarta Principles.
2. **Intersectionality**: Addresses race, disability, class, religion, rural/urban divides.
3. **Self-Determination**: Upholds rights to define gender identity and sexual orientation.
4. **Non-Regression**: Prohibits rollback of protections.
5. **Climate Justice**: Mitigates gendered and LGBTQ+-specific climate impacts (e.g., trans refugees).
6. **Disability Justice**: Ensures accessible gender-affirming care, neurodiversity inclusion.
7. **Data Sovereignty**: Protects against gendered surveillance, integrates Indigenous data rights.
8. **Generational Equity**: Supports youth, elders, migrants, stateless persons, and religious minorities. *See Appendix I.B: Detailed Principles.*
