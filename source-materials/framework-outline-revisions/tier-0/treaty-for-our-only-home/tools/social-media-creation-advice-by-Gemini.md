Excellent! Let's get to it. Creating a strong visual identity for your key messages is a fantastic way to increase reach and impact.

My suggestion is to create a set of branded templates that are clean, professional, and instantly recognizable. We'll focus on clarity, authority, and providing "just enough" variety to keep the social media feed interesting without being chaotic.

Here is a full breakdown of the strategy and the specific prompts you can give to Claude.

### Strategy: The "Quote Card" System

We will design a set of visually consistent templates. Each graphic will feature:
1.  **A Powerful Quote:** The core message.
2.  **Clear Attribution:** The name of the framework, "Treaty for Our Only Home."
3.  **Branding:** Your logo and website URL.
4.  **A Categorical Icon/Color:** A subtle visual cue to indicate the theme of the quote (e.g., Problem, Solution, Vision).

This creates a cohesive "brand identity" for the project's social media presence.

### Part 2: Visual Design & Prompts for Claude

Here are the specific prompts. I'll provide a general style guide and then a specific prompt for one of the quotes as a template you can adapt for all the others.

#### General Style Guide
* **Fonts:** Use a clean, strong sans-serif font like "Inter" or "Manrope".
* **Colors:** Use your established color palette: the deep blues (`#2B4B8C`), the gold (`#DAA520`), and a clean white/off-white background.
* **Layout:** Keep it simple and focused on the text. Ample white space is key.
* **Format:** We'll design for a square format (1080x1080px), which works well on Instagram, Facebook, and LinkedIn.

#### Master Prompt for Claude

You can use this detailed prompt as a template. Just swap out the `[QUOTE TEXT]` and `[CATEGORY ICON/COLOR]` for each graphic you want to create.

```
Create an SVG graphic for a social media quote card. The dimensions should be 1080x1080 pixels.

The overall design should be clean, professional, and minimalist, suitable for a global policy think tank.

Here is the content and layout:

1.  **Background:** A solid, slightly off-white color (#f9fafb).

2.  **Main Quote Text:**
    -   The text should be: "[INSERT QUOTE TEXT HERE]".
    -   Use a bold, dark blue font (color #2B4B8C). Font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif.
    -   The text should be large, easy to read, and centrally aligned, but positioned in the upper-middle of the graphic to leave space at the bottom.
    -   Use smart line breaks for readability.

3.  **Attribution Text:**
    -   Below the main quote, add the text: "— Treaty for Our Only Home".
    -   This text should be smaller than the main quote, in a regular weight, and also in the dark blue color (#2B4B8C).

4.  **Visual Element (Top Border):**
    -   At the very top of the graphic, add a clean, horizontal border line.
    -   The line should be 8 pixels thick.
    -   Use the color [INSERT CATEGORY COLOR HERE]. For "The Problem" category, use a warning-red color like #DC2626. For "The Solution" category, use a hopeful green like #16A34A. For "The Keystone Reforms" category, use the brand's gold color #DAA520.

5.  **Footer Section (Bottom):**
    -   Create a footer area at the bottom of the graphic.
    -   On the left side of the footer, place the website URL: "globalgovernanceframework.org" in a small, subtle grey font (#6b7280).
    -   On the right side of the footer, place the project's logo SVG. Please embed the following SVG code for the logo, scaled down to be about 40px tall. [Here you would paste the SVG code for your logo].

Please provide the complete SVG code for this graphic.
```

By using this template system, you can efficiently generate a whole suite of professional, on-brand graphics that will empower your advocates and make your key messages highly shareable.
