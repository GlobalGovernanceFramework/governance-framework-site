Based on the provided documents for the 'Treaty for Our Only Home,' here is a recommended format and style for the "Cost of Inaction" infographic.

### **Objective & Target Audience**

The infographic's primary goal is to quickly convince advocates, policymakers, and the public that maintaining the status quo is prohibitively expensive and dangerous, while the proposed reforms are a necessary and affordable investment. The tone should be urgent, impactful, and clear, contrasting a catastrophic future with a hopeful, achievable alternative.

### **Recommended Format: Comparative Narrative Infographic**

A vertical, scrollable digital format is recommended for easy sharing on social media, inclusion in emails, and embedding on the `globalgovernanceframework.org` website. The structure should be a clear, two-path narrative: "Our Current Path: The Cost of Inaction" versus "A New Direction: The Investment in Resilience."

### **Column 1: Our Current Path: The Cost of Inaction**
