# **The Mobility Commons: A Framework for Regenerative Transportation & Mobility**

*Version 6.0 Outline | GGF Tier 2 Life Support System*

---

## **Executive Summary**
The Mobility Commons reimagines transportation as a regenerative, equitable, and shared global resource, integral to human flourishing and planetary coordination. It establishes a fossil-free, universally accessible mobility system that respects ecosystems, prioritizes Indigenous and community sovereignty, and integrates emerging technologies like AI, urban air mobility (UAM), and speculative innovations (e.g., levitation). Governed by the **Global Mobility Council (GMC)** with youth and Indigenous representation, funded by the **Global Commons Fund**, and aligned with the **Treaty for Our Only Home**, this framework ensures mobility justice, cultural continuity, and climate resilience through four pillars: Governance, Infrastructure, Economy, and Justice. Metrics track decarbonization, access equity, ecosystem health, and cultural preservation, with safeguards like transparency audits, whistleblower protections, and ceremonial governance.

## **Preamble**
Movement is connection, weaving together communities, cultures, and economies for millennia. Yet, the 20th-century fossil-fuel-based model contributes ~14% of global greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 2022), driving climate change and inequity. This framework transforms transportation into a regenerative commons—a global network of pathways integrating Indigenous wisdom, AI, automation, low-tech solutions, and speculative technologies to connect people, restore ecosystems, and empower communities equitably.

### **Framework Position within the GGF**
As a Tier 2 Life Support System, **The Mobility Commons** drives the GGF's transportation policy, complementing ecological frameworks. Empowered by the **Treaty for Our Only Home**, guided by the **Climate & Energy Governance Framework**, coordinated by the **Meta-Governance Framework** alongside the **Global Supply Chain & Logistics (GSCL)**, **Migration & Human Mobility**, **Food Systems (Kinship Garden)**, and **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience** Frameworks, and accountable to the **Indigenous Framework**, **Moral Operating System (MOS)**, **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer**, **Gender & Kinship Justice Layer**, **Aurora Accord**, **Technology Governance Implementation Framework (TGIF)**, and **Youth & Future Generations Integration Protocol**.

---

## **1. Core Principles**
- **Mobility as a Commons:** The freedom to move is a public good, governed transparently by multi-stakeholder councils, prioritizing community benefit over private gain.
- **Fossil-Free by Default:** All new infrastructure and vehicles align with net-zero targets by 2030, with exemptions for emergency services during transition.
- **Right to Movement & Access:** Safe, affordable, and accessible mobility for all, regardless of location, income, or ability.
- **Universal Design:** Systems designed for universal access, adhering to the **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer**.
- **Bioregional Integration:** Corridors respect ecosystems, watershed boundaries, wildlife migration pathways, and BAZ-led plans, incorporating animal crossing systems and seasonal adaptation protocols.
- **Community-Led & Owned:** Projects co-designed with communities, prioritizing cooperative ownership models.
- **Data Sovereignty & Privacy:** Mobility data, governed by the **Aurora Accord**, is a community-controlled resource, protected against surveillance, with transparency ensured by the **Office of Algorithmic Accountability** and Indigenous/community-led AI ethics councils.
- **Cultural Preservation:** Projects respect Indigenous and local heritage, protecting traditional travel routes and sacred journey corridors per the **Indigenous Framework** and UNESCO guidelines, integrating traditional mobility knowledge (e.g., waterway navigation, seasonal patterns).
- **Interoperability & Standards Harmony:** Global systems ensure cross-border compatibility and open standards, managed via the **Digital Commons**.
- **Universal Capability:** Access to mobility technologies must not depend on innate or acquired biological, psychic, or metaphysical traits, ensuring no new forms of systemic inequity, as an application of the **Moral Operating System (MOS)** and its **Dynamic Rights Spectrum**, which mandates that technologies do not create new hierarchies or diminish agency.
- **Indigenous Transportation Sovereignty:** BAZ-level authority over transportation in traditional territories, with Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC 2.0) protocols.

## **2. Functional Outline: The Four Pillars**

### **Pillar I: Governance & Coordination — The Global Mobility Council**
*Focus: Democratic governance for global mobility within the Meta-Governance Framework.*

- **The Global Mobility Council (GMC):** A sub-council with rotating leadership, including representatives from BAZs, **Urban** and **Rural** frameworks, **GSCL**, **Migration & Human Mobility**, **Food Systems**, **Disaster Risk Reduction**, youth councils with decision-making authority, disability advocates, informal transport workers (via unions/cooperatives), Indigenous representatives, and transport/energy experts.
- **Mandate:** Sets standards (e.g., rail gauge interoperability, EV charging, sustainable aviation fuel), coordinates transnational projects, and resolves disputes using the **Values-Based Conflict Transformation** protocol, with the **Digital Justice Tribunal** as final arbiter. Major infrastructure decisions impacting sacred routes are facilitated through ceremonial governance, using talking circles, elder testimony, and restorative justice principles from the **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework** before consensus is sought.
- **BAZ-Level Integration:** BAZs design local mobility plans, with Indigenous-led governance for traditional territories, coordinated regionally/globally by the GMC.
- **Informal Sector Representation:** Ensured via open consultation tools and cooperative structures.
- **Emergency Mobility Activation:** Rapid deployment of transport for climate disasters, coordinated with the **Crisis Command Protocol**.

### **Pillar II: Regenerative Infrastructure — Building the Pathways**
