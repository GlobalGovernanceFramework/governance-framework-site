# **The Mobility Commons: A Framework for Regenerative Transportation & Mobility**

*Version 2.0 Outline | GGF Tier 2 Application Framework*

---

### **Preamble**
Movement is connection. For millennia, it has woven together communities, cultures, and economies. Yet, the 20th-century model of mobility, built on fossil fuels and inequitable access, has driven climate change and social division. This framework reimagines transportation as a shared, regenerative commons—a global network of pathways designed to connect people, respect ecosystems, and empower communities in a just, sustainable, and culturally sensitive manner.

### **Framework Position within the GGF**
As a core Tier 2 application framework, **The Mobility Commons** is the primary implementation vehicle for the GGF's transportation policy. It is empowered by the **Treaty for Our Only Home** to enforce global standards, guided by the **Climate & Energy Governance Framework** to meet decarbonization targets, coordinated by the **Meta-Governance Framework** alongside the **Global Supply Chain & Logistics (GSCL) Framework**, and held accountable to the ethical principles of the **Indigenous Framework**, **Moral Operating System (MOS)**, **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer**, and **Gender & Kinship Justice Layer**.

---

## **1. Core Principles**
- **Mobility as a Commons:** The freedom to move is a fundamental public good. Global and regional transport networks are governed as a shared commons, not as private assets.
- **Fossil-Free by Default:** All new transportation infrastructure and vehicle standards must align with net-zero targets of the **Climate & Energy Governance Framework**, with a goal of fossil-free infrastructure by 2030, allowing exemptions for emergency services during transitionary phases.
- **Right to Movement & Access:** All individuals have a right to safe, affordable, and accessible mobility, regardless of location, income, or ability.
- **Universal Design:** All transport systems must be designed for universal access from the outset, adhering to the non-negotiable standards of the **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer**.
- **Bioregional Integration:** Transportation corridors must harmonize with ecosystems, respecting watershed boundaries, wildlife corridors, and BAZ-led land use plans.
- **Community-Led & Owned:** Infrastructure projects must be co-designed with local communities, prioritizing community-owned and cooperative models for transport services.
- **Data Sovereignty & Privacy:** All mobility data is treated as a collective resource, governed by the **Aurora Accord**, ensuring privacy, algorithmic accountability, and protection against surveillance or commodification.
- **Cultural Preservation:** Mobility projects must respect Indigenous and local cultural heritage, avoiding disruption to sacred sites and aligning with the **Indigenous Framework**.

## **2. Functional Outline: The Four Pillars of the Mobility Commons**

### **Pillar I: Governance & Coordination — The Global Mobility Council**
*Focus: Establishing a democratic and coordinated governance structure for global mobility as a specialized sub-council within the Meta-Governance Framework.*

- **The Global Mobility Council (GMC):** A sub-council of the **Meta-Governance Council** with representation from BAZs, the **Urban** and **Rural** development frameworks, the **GSCL Council**, youth advocates, disability advocates, informal transport workers (e.g., rickshaw drivers in Global South cities), and experts in transport and energy.
- **Mandate:** Sets global standards for sustainable transport (e.g., rail gauge interoperability, EV charging standards, sustainable aviation fuel requirements), coordinates transnational infrastructure projects, and mediates cross-border disputes using the **Values-Based Conflict Transformation** protocol, with the **Digital Justice Tribunal** as the final arbiter for intractable disputes.
- **BAZ-Level Integration:** BAZ councils are empowered to design and manage their own internal mobility plans, coordinated at the regional and global level by the GMC.

### **Pillar II: Regenerative Infrastructure — Building the Pathways**
*Focus: The planning, financing, and construction of sustainable, resilient, and inclusive transportation networks.*

- **The Global Pathways Initiative:** A portfolio within the **Global Commons Fund** dedicated to financing major regenerative transport projects, with a mandate for long-term maintenance and climate resilience audits every 5 years.
  - **Global High-Speed Rail Network:** A priority project to connect major population centers, reducing reliance on short-haul aviation.
  - **Sustainable Maritime Corridors:** Establishing "green corridors" for ships powered by ammonia, hydrogen, or batteries.
  - **Global EV & Hydrogen Infrastructure:** Coordinating the rollout of universal charging and refueling networks.
  - **Non-Motorized Transport:** Supporting low-tech solutions like pedestrian pathways and cycle networks in BAZs where appropriate.
- **Bioregional Design Protocols:** All infrastructure projects must undergo a **Planetary Health Impact Assessment** and an **Intersectional Impact Assessment**, securing approval from relevant BAZ councils and aligning with the **Indigenous Framework** to protect ecosystems and cultural heritage.

### **Pillar III: The Mobility Economy — Powering Just Transitions**
*Focus: Creating economic models that support regenerative mobility and ensure a just transition for workers.*

- **Integration with AUBI & Work in Liberation:**
  - Using public and shared transport (e.g., trains, community e-bikes) generates **Hearts** in the **Love Ledger**, translating into tangible benefits like reduced fares or community infrastructure investments.
  - Workers transitioning from fossil fuel-based transport industries are guaranteed retraining and placement in **Community Work Teams** focused on building and maintaining new infrastructure, supported by **AUBI**.
- **Mobility as a Service (MaaS) Commons:** A global, open-source digital platform for integrated mobility, allowing users to plan and pay for journeys across multiple modes of transport (public transit, bike-share, rail). This platform is governed as a **Digital Commons** under the **Aurora Accord**, with platform cooperatives adhering to labor standards set by the **Fractal Labor Parliament (FLP)**, ensuring fair wages and rights for ride-share and delivery workers.

### **Pillar IV: Mobility Justice — Ensuring Equitable Access for All**
*Focus: Embedding equity as the core design principle of the entire mobility system.*

- **Mandatory Universal Access Audits:** All new infrastructure projects and vehicle designs are audited for compliance with the **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer**, with oversight by the **Global Disability Alliance (GDA)**.
- **The Rural-Urban Connection Compact:** A policy mandate to combat transport poverty by ensuring rural and remote communities have affordable and reliable connections to urban centers, co-designed by the **Urban** and **Rural** development frameworks.
- **The Right to Movement Charter:** A legal charter, enforceable by the **Digital Justice Tribunal**, that protects individuals and communities from displacement due to transport projects, bans "green displacement," and ensures affordable access for all.
- **Gender & Kinship Equity:** Metrics tracking safety and accessibility for women, LGBTQ+ individuals, and other marginalized groups, audited by the **Gender & Kinship Justice Council**.

## **3. Implementation & Metrics**

- **Implementation Roadmap:** A phased rollout beginning with the establishment of the Global Mobility Council, followed by pilot projects in "willing" BAZs and nations (defined by commitment to decarbonization and participatory governance).
- **Metrics for Success:**
  - **Decarbonization:** % reduction in global transport emissions, tracked against **Climate & Energy Framework** targets.
  - **Access Equity:** % of population living within a 15-minute walk of affordable public transport (targets differ for urban/rural).
  - **Universal Access:** Score on the **Disability Impact Assessment (DIA)** for all new infrastructure.
  - **Economic Transition:** # of workers successfully transitioned from fossil-fuel transport jobs to regenerative sectors.
