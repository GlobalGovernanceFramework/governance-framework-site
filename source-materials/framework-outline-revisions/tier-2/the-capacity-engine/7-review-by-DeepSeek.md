- Needs more detail on policy change strategies

## Final Recommendations

1. Develop **visual framework map** (as noted in document)
2. Create **implementation playbook** with step-by-step guides
3. Build **library of case studies** showing successful models
4. Develop **advocacy toolkit** for policy makers
5. Establish **educator certification program**

This framework represents world-class thinking in educational transformation. With some refinement in implementation specifics and metrics, it has potential to guide systemic change globally. The poetic vision combined with practical structures makes it both inspiring and actionable.
