## **Executive Summary**
The **Capacity Engine** is the foundational engine for cultivating citizens equipped to navigate and shape the global governance ecosystem (**Treaty for Our Only Home**, **AUBI**, **Work in Liberation**, **Meta-Governance**, **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework**, **Synoptic Protocol**, **GCRSD**). It fosters regenerative, equitable learning through BAZ-led polycentric networks, youth-led governance, and the **Lifelong Learning & Competency Passport**, which translates skills into recognized roles within the **Fractal Labor Parliament (FLP)**, Community Work Teams, and Meta-Governance. Rooted in systems thinking, spiral dynamics, neurodiversity, Indigenous-guided **Right Relationship**, and liberatory pedagogy, it equips learners with epistemic resilience, peacebuilding, spiritual-ethical literacy, polycrisis resilience, somatic learning, digital democracy, and futures literacy. Supported by a **Political & Economic Transition Toolkit**, **Data Sovereignty Clause**, and **Joy & Wonder Metrics**, it ensures resilience and cultural nuance over a 20-year global adoption timeline.

## **Preamble**
Education is the heartbeat of a regenerative civilization, empowering a Sahel girl mapping ecosystems, a Nordic teen shaping **Treaty**-aligned policies, or an Amazonian elder guiding a BAZ-led classroom. Inspired by the Butterfly Party’s vision (**STR-210**, **TAK-205**), this framework equips citizens to navigate polycrises, restore ecosystems, govern equitably, counter disinformation, resolve conflicts, and embody ethical wisdom. The **Lifelong Learning & Competency Passport** ensures skills translate into democratic power, fostering a **Spiral-Aware Rights Culture** (**MOS**) for a thriving transnational democracy.
