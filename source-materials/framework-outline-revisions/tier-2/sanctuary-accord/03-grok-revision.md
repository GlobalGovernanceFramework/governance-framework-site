*Version 1.1 Outline | A GGF Tier 2 Framework for Consciousness Technology Governance*

## Header

* **Tier:** 2 (Specialized Application Framework)
* **Status:** Draft Outline
* **Parent Framework:** `Consciousness & Inner Development Framework`
* **Overseeing Council:** `Global Technology Council` (`council_gtc`)
* **Related Documents:**
    * `Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework`
    * `Technology Governance Implementation Framework` (`TGIF`)
    * `Mental Health Governance Framework`

    * `Justice Systems Implementation Framework`

## Preamble: A Covenant of Care

Humanity is developing technologies with the potential to profoundly alter consciousness, offering paths to healing and expanded awareness. This power carries an immense responsibility. The Sanctuary Accord is a covenant to ensure that this exploration is guided by reverence, safety, and justice. It creates a sanctuary—a protected and sacred space—for the ethical development and application of consciousness technologies, including psychedelics, neuro-technologies, and other modalities. Its purpose is not to restrict, but to ensure that our journey into the inner cosmos is as mindful and honorable as our journey into the outer one.

## 1. Core Principles

* **Cognitive Liberty & Sovereignty:** Every individual has the right to cognitive self-determination, free from coercion. The choice to engage with consciousness-altering technologies is a fundamental personal and health right.
* **Sacred Sovereignty (The Primacy Principle):** All governance under this Accord is subordinate to the absolute sovereignty of the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework (`framework_indigenous`)**. Indigenous communities hold ultimate authority and veto power over any use of sacred plants and ceremonial knowledge. The **Red Lines Clause** is non-negotiable.
* **The Precautionary Principle:** When an activity raises threats of harm to human consciousness or cultural integrity, precautionary measures shall be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically. The burden of proof falls on the innovator, not the community.
* **Reciprocity & Right Relationship:** Any benefit derived from traditional knowledge or consciousness exploration must flow back to the source communities and contribute to the well-being of the whole.
* **Definition of Sacred Plants:** For the purposes of this Accord, "sacred plants" refers to plants traditionally used in ceremonial contexts (e.g., peyote, ayahuasca, psilocybin mushrooms) as determined by the **Earth Council**. Synthetic analogues may be included under Red Lines protections if their production threatens the cultural or ecological integrity of the original plant.

## 2. The Four Pillars of the Sanctuary Accord

### Pillar I: Governance & Ethical Oversight

*Focus: Establishing expert bodies to ensure all activities are safe, ethical, and aligned with GGF principles.*

* **The Neuro-Ethics Review Board:**
    * **Structure:** A specialized, permanent sub-committee of the **Global Technology Council (`council_gtc`)**.
    * **Mandate:** To provide rigorous ethical review, safety certification, and ongoing oversight for all consciousness technologies, protocols, and clinical applications seeking GGF sanction.
    * **Composition:** A multi-disciplinary body including neuroscientists, ethicists, Indigenous knowledge keepers (appointed by the **Earth Council**), and mental health professionals.
    * **Trauma-Informed Safety Protocols:** The Board is responsible for developing and enforcing mandatory, trauma-informed safety protocols for all GGF-sanctioned clinical applications, ensuring participant well-being is the highest priority.
    * **Adverse Event Reporting System:** The Board will manage a transparent, public-facing system for reporting and analyzing adverse events, ensuring continuous learning and safety improvements.
    * **Practitioner & Integration Standards:** The Board, in collaboration with the **Mental Health Governance Framework**, will establish and enforce rigorous certification standards for all practitioners and mandatory requirements for post-session integration support.
* **BAZ-Level Sanctuary Councils:**
    * **Role:** Decentralized, community-led bodies within **Bioregional Autonomous Zones (`institution_baz`)** responsible for licensing and monitoring local practitioners and healing centers, ensuring cultural appropriateness and adherence to community standards.

### Pillar II: Sacred Knowledge & Ceremonial Sovereignty

*Focus: Upholding the Primacy Principle and ensuring traditional knowledge is honored, not extracted.*

* **Ceremonial Use Protocols:**
    * **Jurisdiction:** This domain is governed exclusively by the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework**. The Sanctuary Accord provides the interface for formalizing this deference.
    * **Process:** Any research or application involving sacred plants or practices traditionally used in ceremony must first be submitted to the **Earth Council (`council_earth`)**. Only with the Earth Council's express, uncoerced consent under **FPIC 2.0** protocols can the Neuro-Ethics Review Board even consider a proposal.
* **The Red Lines Clause Interface:** The Accord formally recognizes that the **Earth Council** can declare specific plants, practices, or knowledge domains as "Red Lined"—completely off-limits to any form of research, commercialization, or non-traditional application, with no appeal.
* **Community-Specific Sovereignty & Anti-Appropriation:**
    * **Community Sovereignty Protocols:** The Accord recognizes that each Indigenous nation or community has the right to define its own relationship with its knowledge. The **Earth Council** will facilitate the creation of community-specific protocols, allowing nations to choose between engagement models (like the Sacred Reciprocity License) or complete non-engagement (as protected by the Red Lines Clause).
    * **Sacred Plant & Analogue Protection:** The **Earth Council** has the authority to extend Red Lines protections not only to specific sacred plants (e.g., peyote) but also to their synthetic analogues if their production is deemed to threaten the cultural or ecological integrity of the original plant.
    * **Anti-Appropriation Enforcement:** The **Digital Justice Tribunal** is empowered to hear cases of cultural appropriation related to ceremonial practices, even when no formal license is in place, treating it as a violation of the GGF's core principle of Sacred Sovereignty.

### Pillar III: Ethical Research & Therapeutic Application

*Focus: Defining the standards for safe and beneficial research and use.*

* **Clinical & Therapeutic Guidelines:**
    * **Integration with Mental Health Framework:** All sanctioned therapeutic uses must be integrated with the principles and practices of the **Mental Health Governance Framework (`framework_mental_health`)**, emphasizing holistic care, integration support, and practitioner certification.
    * **Research Exemptions:** Legitimate scientific research may proceed under strict oversight by the Neuro-Ethics Review Board, provided it fully complies with the **Red Lines Clause** and receives explicit approval from the **Earth Council** for any use of sacred plants or traditional knowledge.
* **Research Moratoriums & Sandboxes:**
    * **Authority:** The Neuro-Ethics Review Board has the authority to place temporary moratoriums on high-risk areas of research (e.g., non-consensual neuro-tech).
    * **Ethical Sandboxes:** Establishes controlled environments for piloting new therapeutic models in partnership with BAZ-level Sanctuary Councils.

### Pillar IV: Reciprocity & Regenerative Economics

*Focus: Ensuring the economic flows from consciousness technologies are just and healing.*

* **The Sacred Reciprocity License:**
    * **Mechanism:** A legally binding license required for any commercial application derived from traditional knowledge or sacred plants.
    * **Economic Flow:** A percentage of all revenue is automatically directed back to the originating Indigenous communities and the **Global Commons Fund (`mechanism_gcf`)**.
    * **Implementation:** These value flows are managed and tracked transparently on the **Love Ledger (`platform_love_ledger`)**, often paid in **Hearts (`mechanism_hearts`)** to directly support the care economy of the source community.
* **Enforcement:** Violations of a Sacred Reciprocity License are adjudicated by the **Digital Justice Tribunal (`institution_dj_tribunal`)**, with the power to levy fines and revoke GGF certification.

## 3. Implementation Plan (Milestone-Based)

* **Milestone 1: Governance Activation.** Achieved when the Neuro-Ethics Review Board is formally constituted and its charter is ratified by both the `Global Technology Council` and the `Earth Council`.
* **Milestone 2: Protocol Co-Design.** Achieved when the Ceremonial Use Protocols and the Sacred Reciprocity License framework have been co-designed with and approved by the `Earth Council`.
* **Milestone 3: Pilot Program Launch.** Achieved when the first three BAZ-level Sanctuary Councils are established and the first GGF-certified therapeutic pilot program begins.
* **Milestone 4: Full Ecosystem Integration.** Achieved when the first case related to the Accord is successfully adjudicated by the `Digital Justice Tribunal` and the first reciprocity payments are successfully distributed via the `Love Ledger`.

## 4. Implementation Pathways & Legal Interface

*Focus: Bridging the Accord's vision with the complex realities of existing national and sub-national legal systems.*

* **GGF Regulatory Sandboxes:** The Accord will promote the creation of legal "sandboxes," similar to existing state-level pilot programs. Within these GGF-sanctioned zones, BAZ-level Sanctuary Councils can operate with legal clarity, providing a model for broader regulatory reform.
* **Harm Reduction Integration:** For jurisdictions where prohibition remains, the Accord will provide harm reduction guidelines. This includes best practices for safe use, community-based peer support models, and frameworks for non-criminal, public health-based responses to substance use.
* **Interface with Existing Law:** The **Global Technology Council** and the **Earth Council** will jointly establish a legal working group to create "interface protocols" that map the Accord's principles onto existing state and national legalization efforts, ensuring a pathway for alignment and preventing the creation of conflicting regulatory regimes.
* **Global Scope Considerations:** The Accord will engage with international Indigenous communities and legal frameworks through the **Earth Council** to ensure culturally appropriate adaptations of its principles, recognizing the diversity of global regulatory and cultural contexts.
