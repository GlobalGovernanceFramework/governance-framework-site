### **Outline: The Sanctuary Accord**

*Version 1.0 Outline | A GGF Tier 2 Framework for Consciousness Technology Governance*

**Header**

* **Tier:** 2 (Specialized Application Framework)
* **Status:** Draft Outline
* **Parent Framework:** `Consciousness & Inner Development Framework`
* **Overseeing Council:** `Global Technology Council` (`council_gtc`)
* **Related Documents:**
    * `Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework`
    * `Technology Governance Implementation Framework` (`TGIF`)
    * `Mental Health Governance Framework`
    * `AUBI Framework`
    * `Justice Systems Implementation Framework`

**Preamble: A Covenant of Care**

Humanity is developing technologies with the potential to profoundly alter consciousness, offering paths to healing and expanded awareness. This power carries an immense responsibility. The Sanctuary Accord is a covenant to ensure that this exploration is guided by reverence, safety, and justice. It creates a sanctuary—a protected and sacred space—for the ethical development and application of consciousness technologies, including psychedelics, neuro-technologies, and other modalities. Its purpose is not to restrict, but to ensure that our journey into the inner cosmos is as mindful and honorable as our journey into the outer one.

**1. Core Principles**

* **Cognitive Liberty & Sovereignty:** Every individual has the right to cognitive self-determination, free from coercion. The choice to engage with consciousness-altering technologies is a fundamental personal and health right.
* **Sacred Sovereignty (The Primacy Principle):** All governance under this Accord is subordinate to the absolute sovereignty of the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework (`framework_indigenous`)**. Indigenous communities hold ultimate authority and veto power over any use of sacred plants and ceremonial knowledge. The **Red Lines Clause** is non-negotiable.
* **The Precautionary Principle:** When an activity raises threats of harm to human consciousness or cultural integrity, precautionary measures shall be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically. The burden of proof falls on the innovator, not the community.
* **Reciprocity & Right Relationship:** Any benefit derived from traditional knowledge or consciousness exploration must flow back to the source communities and contribute to the well-being of the whole.

**2. The Four Pillars of the Sanctuary Accord**

#### **Pillar I: Governance & Ethical Oversight**

*Focus: Establishing the expert bodies to ensure all activities are safe, ethical, and aligned with GGF principles.*

* **The Neuro-Ethics Review Board:**
    * **Structure:** A specialized, permanent sub-committee of the **Global Technology Council (`council_gtc`)**.
    * **Mandate:** To provide rigorous ethical review, safety certification, and ongoing oversight for all consciousness technologies, protocols, and clinical applications seeking GGF sanction.
    * **Composition:** A multi-disciplinary body including neuroscientists, ethicists, Indigenous knowledge keepers (appointed by the **Earth Council**), and mental health professionals.
* **BAZ-Level Sanctuary Councils:**
    * **Role:** Decentralized, community-led bodies within **Bioregional Autonomous Zones (`institution_baz`)** responsible for licensing and monitoring local practitioners and healing centers, ensuring cultural appropriateness and adherence to community standards.

#### **Pillar II: Sacred Knowledge & Ceremonial Sovereignty**

*Focus: Upholding the Primacy Principle and ensuring traditional knowledge is honored, not extracted.*

* **Ceremonial Use Protocols:**
    * **Jurisdiction:** This domain is governed exclusively by the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework**. The Sanctuary Accord provides the interface for formalizing this deference.
    * **Process:** Any research or application involving sacred plants or practices traditionally used in ceremony must first be submitted to the **Earth Council (`council_earth`)**. Only with the Earth Council's express, uncoerced consent under **FPIC 2.0** protocols can the Neuro-Ethics Review Board even consider a proposal.
* **The Red Lines Clause Interface:** The Accord formally recognizes that the **Earth Council** can declare specific plants, practices, or knowledge domains as "Red Lined"—completely off-limits to any form of research, commercialization, or non-traditional application, with no appeal.

#### **Pillar III: Ethical Research & Therapeutic Application**

*Focus: Defining the standards for safe and beneficial research and use.*

* **Clinical & Therapeutic Guidelines:**
    * **Integration with Mental Health Framework:** All sanctioned therapeutic uses must be integrated with the principles and practices of the **Mental Health Governance Framework (`framework_mental_health`)**, emphasizing holistic care, integration support, and practitioner certification.
* **Research Moratoriums & Sandboxes:**
    * **Authority:** The Neuro-Ethics Review Board has the authority to place temporary moratoriums on high-risk areas of research (e.g., non-consensual neuro-tech).
    * **Ethical Sandboxes:** Establishes controlled environments for piloting new therapeutic models in partnership with BAZ-level Sanctuary Councils.

#### **Pillar IV: Reciprocity & Regenerative Economics**

*Focus: Ensuring the economic flows from consciousness technologies are just and healing.*

* **The Sacred Reciprocity License:**
    * **Mechanism:** A legally binding license required for any commercial application derived from traditional knowledge or sacred plants.
    * **Economic Flow:** A percentage of all revenue is automatically directed back to the originating Indigenous communities and the **Global Commons Fund (`mechanism_gcf`)**.
    * **Implementation:** These value flows are managed and tracked transparently on the **Love Ledger (`platform_love_ledger`)**, often paid in **Hearts (`mechanism_hearts`)** to directly support the care economy of the source community.
* **Enforcement:** Violations of a Sacred Reciprocity License are adjudicated by the **Digital Justice Tribunal (`institution_dj_tribunal`)**, with the power to levy fines and revoke GGF certification.

**3. Implementation Plan (Milestone-Based)**

* **Milestone 1: Governance Activation.** Achieved when the Neuro-Ethics Review Board is formally constituted and its charter is ratified by both the `Global Technology Council` and the `Earth Council`.
* **Milestone 2: Protocol Co-Design.** Achieved when the Ceremonial Use Protocols and the Sacred Reciprocity License framework have been co-designed with and approved by the `Earth Council`.
* **Milestone 3: Pilot Program Launch.** Achieved when the first three BAZ-level Sanctuary Councils are established and the first GGF-certified therapeutic pilot program begins.
* **Milestone 4: Full Ecosystem Integration.** Achieved when the first case related to the Accord is successfully adjudicated by the `Digital Justice Tribunal` and the first reciprocity payments are successfully distributed via the `Love Ledger`.
