# Global Health & Pandemic Security (GH&PS) Framework Outline

## Preamble & Core Principles

**Vision:** To establish a community-controlled global immune system that prevents, detects, and defeats pandemics with speed, equity, and resilience, serving as the operational arm under the strategic guidance of the Planetary Health Council.

**Core Principles:**
- **Speed & Solidarity Over Sovereignty (in Crisis):** Rapid, coordinated global action supersedes national interests during Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC).
- **Open Science & Public-First IP:** All publicly funded health innovations are held in the global commons, free from monopolistic barriers.
- **Radical Equity:** Prioritize marginalized, Indigenous, and vulnerable populations in resource allocation and system design.
- **Proactive Prevention:** Emphasize upstream zoonotic and environmental risk mitigation over reactive measures.
- **Subsidiarity & Community Sovereignty:** Empower local and regional systems as the foundation of global health security, with communities retaining ultimate control.
- **Scientific Integrity with Epistemic Humility:** Protect scientific rigor while integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and community insights.
- **Dignified Care:** Ensure human dignity and cultural respect in all health interventions, especially during crises.

## 1. Governance Architecture: The Global Immune Command

### 1.1 Global Health Security Council (GHSC)
- **Function:** Central command-and-control body for PHEICs, with binding authority granted by the **Treaty for Our Only Home** (Pillar 3).
- **Composition:** Rotating membership with permanent seats for regional health bodies (e.g., Africa CDC, PAHO), 10% youth delegates (under 30), and representation from Indigenous health organizations and civil society. At least 50% of decision-making votes reserved for Global South representatives to prevent dominance by wealthy nations.
- **Powers:**
  - Mandate and enforce global health regulations (e.g., travel restrictions, trade adjustments, mandatory data sharing) during crises.
  - Deploy the Health Emergency Corps (HEC) for rapid response.
  - Oversee equitable allocation of medical countermeasures via a pre-negotiated algorithm prioritizing vulnerability, public health impact, and global health contributions.
  - Coordinate with the **Gaian Trade Framework** to establish "health corridors" for unimpeded flow of medical goods during PHEICs.
- **Mechanisms:**
  - **Tiered Response Protocols:** Decisions categorized for speed and deliberation: Immediate (6-hour response for critical containment), Urgent (48-hour response for logistics), Complex (7-day response with accelerated consultation involving Planetary Health Assemblies).
