# **The Mobility Commons: A Framework for Regenerative Transportation & Mobility**

*Version 3.0 Outline | GGF Tier 2 Application Framework*

---

## **Executive Summary**
The Mobility Commons reimagines transportation as a regenerative, equitable, and shared global resource. It establishes a fossil-free, universally accessible mobility system that respects ecosystems, prioritizes community ownership, and integrates emerging technologies like AI and urban air mobility (UAM). Governed by the **Global Mobility Council (GMC)**, funded by the **Global Commons Fund**, and aligned with the **Treaty for Our Only Home**, this framework ensures mobility justice, cultural preservation, and climate resilience through four pillars: Governance, Infrastructure, Economy, and Justice. Metrics track decarbonization, access equity, and labor transitions, with ethical safeguards like transparency audits and whistleblower protections.

## **Preamble**
Movement is connection, weaving together communities, cultures, and economies for millennia. Yet, the 20th-century fossil-fuel-based model has fueled climate change and inequity, contributing ~14% of global greenhouse gas emissions (IPCC, 2022). This framework transforms transportation into a regenerative commons—a global network of pathways integrating AI, automation, and low-tech solutions to connect people, respect ecosystems, and empower communities equitably.

### **Framework Position within the GGF**
As a Tier 2 application framework, **The Mobility Commons** drives the GGF's transportation policy. Empowered by the **Treaty for Our Only Home**, guided by the **Climate & Energy Governance Framework**, coordinated by the **Meta-Governance Framework** alongside the **Global Supply Chain & Logistics (GSCL) Framework**, and accountable to the **Indigenous Framework**, **Moral Operating System (MOS)**, **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer**, **Gender & Kinship Justice Layer**, and **Aurora Accord**.

---

## **1. Core Principles**
- **Mobility as a Commons:** The freedom to move is a public good, governed transparently by multi-stakeholder councils, prioritizing community benefit over private gain.
- **Fossil-Free by Default:** All new infrastructure and vehicles align with net-zero targets by 2030, with exemptions for emergency services during transition.
- **Right to Movement & Access:** Safe, affordable, and accessible mobility for all, regardless of location, income, or ability.
- **Universal Design:** Systems designed for universal access, adhering to the **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer**.
- **Bioregional Integration:** Corridors respect ecosystems, watershed boundaries, and BAZ-led plans.
- **Community-Led & Owned:** Projects co-designed with communities, prioritizing cooperative models.
- **Data Sovereignty & Privacy:** Mobility data, governed by the **Aurora Accord**, is a collective resource, protected against surveillance, with transparency ensured by the **Office of Algorithmic Accountability**.
- **Cultural Preservation:** Projects respect Indigenous and local heritage, aligned with the **Indigenous Framework** and UNESCO heritage guidelines.
- **Interoperability & Standards Harmony:** Global systems ensure cross-border compatibility and open standards, managed via the **Digital Commons**.

## **2. Functional Outline: The Four Pillars**

### **Pillar I: Governance & Coordination — The Global Mobility Council**
*Focus: Democratic governance for global mobility within the Meta-Governance Framework.*

- **The Global Mobility Council (GMC):** A sub-council with rotating leadership, including representatives from BAZs, **Urban** and **Rural** frameworks, **GSCL Council**, youth, disability advocates, informal transport workers (via unions/cooperatives), and transport/energy experts.
- **Mandate:** Sets standards (e.g., rail gauge interoperability, EV charging, sustainable aviation fuel), coordinates transnational projects, and resolves disputes using the **Values-Based Conflict Transformation** protocol, with the **Digital Justice Tribunal** as final arbiter.
- **BAZ-Level Integration:** BAZs design local mobility plans, coordinated regionally/globally by the GMC.
- **Informal Sector Representation:** Ensured via open consultation tools and cooperative structures.

### **Pillar II: Regenerative Infrastructure — Building the Pathways**
*Focus: Sustainable, resilient, and inclusive transport networks.*

- **The Global Pathways Initiative:** Funded by the **Global Commons Fund**, with mandates for long-term maintenance, 5-year climate resilience audits, and smart grid integration for EV charging.
  - **Global High-Speed Rail Network:** Connects population centers to reduce short-haul aviation.
  - **Sustainable Maritime Corridors:** Green corridors for ammonia/hydrogen/battery-powered ships, supporting **Just Transition for Port Workers** and **Blue Economy** principles.
  - **Global EV & Hydrogen Infrastructure:** Universal charging/refueling networks.
  - **Non-Motorized Transport:** Pedestrian pathways and cycle networks in BAZs.
- **Bioregional Design Protocols:** Projects undergo **Planetary Health** and **Intersectional Impact Assessments**, approved by BAZs and aligned with the **Indigenous Framework**.
- **Emerging Technologies:** Urban air mobility (UAM) and drones assessed via the **Technology Risk & Responsibility Tiering System (TRRT)** under the **Global Technology Council (GTC)**.

### **Pillar III: The Mobility Economy — Powering Just Transitions**
*Focus: Economic models for regenerative mobility and worker transitions.*

- **Integration with AUBI & Work in Liberation:**
  - **Hearts** in the **Love Ledger** reward sustainable transport use (e.g., trains, e-bikes), redeemable for reduced fares, tax credits, or community projects, governed by the **Social Resilience Council**.
  - Workers transitioning from fossil fuel industries receive retraining and placement in **Community Work Teams**, supported by **AUBI**.
- **Mobility as a Service (MaaS) Commons:** An open-source platform for integrated mobility, governed by the **Aurora Accord**, with algorithmic transparency via the **Office of Algorithmic Accountability**. Platform cooperatives adhere to **Fractal Labor Parliament (FLP)** standards for fair wages and rights for gig workers.

### **Pillar IV: Mobility Justice — Ensuring Equitable Access**
*Focus: Equity as the core design principle.*

- **Mandatory Universal Access Audits:** Projects audited for compliance with the **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer**, overseen by the **Global Disability Alliance (GDA)**.
- **The Rural-Urban Connection Compact:** Ensures affordable rural-urban connections, co-designed by **Urban** and **Rural** frameworks.
- **The Right to Movement Charter:** Enforceable by the **Digital Justice Tribunal**, bans **green displacement**, and ensures affordable access.
- **Gender & Kinship Equity:** Metrics for safety and accessibility for women, LGBTQ+ individuals, youth (e.g., school transport), audited by the **Gender & Kinship Justice Council**.
- **Mobility Reparations Program:** A **Global Commons Fund** portfolio to address historical harms from transport projects, co-designed with BAZs and the **Gender & Kinship Justice Council**.
