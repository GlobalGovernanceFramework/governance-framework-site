# **The Mobility Commons: A Framework for Regenerative Transportation & Mobility**

*Version 1.0 Outline | GGF Tier 2 Application Framework*

---

### **Preamble**
Movement is connection. For millennia, it has been the thread weaving together communities, cultures, and economies. Yet, the 20th-century model of mobility, built on fossil fuels and inequitable access, has driven climate change and social division. This framework reimagines transportation not as a system of extraction, but as a shared, regenerative commons—a global network of pathways designed to connect people, respect ecosystems, and empower communities in a just and sustainable manner.

### **Framework Position within the GGF**
As a core Tier 2 application framework, **The Mobility Commons** is the primary implementation vehicle for the GGF's transportation policy. It is empowered by the **Treaty for Our Only Home** to enforce global standards. It is guided by the **Climate & Energy Governance Framework** to meet decarbonization targets. It is coordinated by the **Meta-Governance Framework** alongside its sibling framework, the **Global Supply Chain & Logistics (GSCL) Framework**, and is held accountable to the ethical principles of the **Indigenous Framework** and the **Moral Operating System (MOS)**.

## **1. Core Principles**
* **Mobility as a Commons:** The freedom to move is a fundamental public good. Global and regional transport networks are to be governed as a shared commons, not as purely private assets.
* **Fossil-Free by Default:** All new transportation infrastructure and vehicle standards must align with the net-zero targets of the **Climate & Energy Governance Framework**.
* **Right to Movement & Access:** All individuals have a right to safe, affordable, and accessible mobility, regardless of location, income, or ability.
* **Universal Design:** All transport systems must be designed for universal access from the outset, adhering to the non-negotiable standards of the **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer**.
* **Bioregional Integration:** Transportation corridors must be designed in harmony with ecosystems, respecting watershed boundaries, wildlife corridors, and BAZ-led land use plans.
* **Community-Led & Owned:** Infrastructure projects must be co-designed with local communities, prioritizing community-owned and cooperative models for transport services.

## **2. Functional Outline: The Four Pillars of the Mobility Commons**

### **Pillar I: Governance & Coordination — The Global Mobility Council**
*Focus: Establishing the democratic and coordinated governance structure for global mobility as a specialized sub-council within the Meta-Governance Framework.*

* **The Global Mobility Council (GMC):** A sub-council of the **Meta-Governance Council** with representation from BAZs, the **Urban** and **Rural** development frameworks, the **GSCL Council**, and experts in transport and energy.
* **Mandate:** Sets global standards for sustainable transport (e.g., rail gauge interoperability, EV charging standards, sustainable aviation fuel requirements), coordinates transnational infrastructure projects, and mediates cross-border disputes.
* **BAZ-Level Integration:** BAZ councils are empowered to design and manage their own internal mobility plans, which are then coordinated at the regional and global level by the GMC.

### **Pillar II: Regenerative Infrastructure — Building the Pathways**
*Focus: The planning, financing, and construction of sustainable, physical transportation networks.*

* **The Global Pathways Initiative:** A portfolio within the **Global Commons Fund** dedicated to financing major regenerative transport projects.
    * **Global High-Speed Rail Network:** A priority project to connect major population centers, reducing reliance on short-haul aviation.
    * **Sustainable Maritime Corridors:** Establishing "green corridors" for ships powered by ammonia, hydrogen, or batteries.
    * **Global EV & Hydrogen Infrastructure:** Coordinating the rollout of universal charging and refueling networks.
* **Bioregional Design Protocols:** All infrastructure projects must undergo a **Planetary Health Impact Assessment** and secure approval from relevant BAZ councils, ensuring wildlife corridors and ecosystem health are protected.

### **Pillar III: The Mobility Economy — Powering Just Transitions**
*Focus: Creating the economic models that support regenerative mobility and ensure a just transition for workers.*

* **Integration with AUBI & Work in Liberation:**
    * Using public and shared transport (e.g., trains, community e-bikes) generates **Hearts** in the **Love Ledger**, rewarding sustainable behavior.
    * Workers transitioning from fossil fuel-based transport industries are guaranteed retraining and placement in **Community Work Teams** focused on building and maintaining the new infrastructure, supported by **AUBI**.
* **Mobility as a Service (MaaS) Commons:** Development of a global, open-source digital platform for integrated mobility, allowing users to plan and pay for journeys across multiple modes of transport (public transit, bike-share, rail). This platform is governed as a **Digital Commons**.

### **Pillar IV: Mobility Justice — Ensuring Equitable Access for All**
*Focus: Embedding equity as the core design principle of the entire mobility system.*

* **Mandatory Universal Access Audits:** All new infrastructure projects and vehicle designs are audited for compliance with the **Universal Access & Disability Justice Layer**.
* **The Rural-Urban Connection Compact:** A specific policy mandate to combat transport poverty by ensuring that rural and remote communities have affordable and reliable connections to urban centers. This is co-designed by the **Urban** and **Rural** development frameworks.
* **The Right to Movement Charter:** A legal charter, enforceable by the **Digital Justice Tribunal**, that protects individuals and communities from being displaced or cut off by transport projects and ensures affordable access for all.

## **3. Implementation & Metrics**

* **Implementation Roadmap:** A phased rollout beginning with the establishment of the Global Mobility Council, followed by pilot projects for the Global Pathways Initiative in willing BAZs and "coalition of the willing" nations.
* **Metrics for Success:**
    * **Decarbonization:** % reduction in global transport emissions, tracked against **Climate & Energy Framework** targets.
    * **Access Equity:** % of population living within a 15-minute walk of affordable public transport (targets differ for urban/rural).
    * **Universal Access:** Score on the **Disability Impact Assessment (DIA)** for all new infrastructure.
    * **Economic Transition:** # of workers successfully transitioned from fossil-fuel transport jobs to regenerative sectors.
    * **Modal Shift:** % shift from private car and air travel to rail and shared mobility.
