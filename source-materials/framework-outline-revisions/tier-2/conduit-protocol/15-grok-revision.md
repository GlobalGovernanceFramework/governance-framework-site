# The Conduit Protocol: A Framework for Shared Infrastructure v0.6

**Framework ID:** `framework_conduit_protocol`

**Tier:** 2

**Status:** Concept Draft

**Implementation Priority:** Critical

## 1. Vision

To transform the world's fragmented infrastructure into a unified, resilient global commons that serves as the circulatory system for planetary civilization—ensuring every community has access to clean energy, secure data networks, and clean water while respecting Indigenous sovereignty and enabling a just transition to a regenerative future.

## 2. Core Principles

This framework inherits all core GGF principles, particularly **Agility & Adaptability**, and places special emphasis on the following:

1. **Infrastructure as a Commons:** Essential physical conduits are not commodities to be owned but commons to be stewarded for the benefit of all, superseding private extractive rights.
2. **Universal Access:** All individuals and communities have a fundamental right to access the essential services provided by the infrastructure commons (energy, data, water).
3. **Resilience & Redundancy:** The network must be designed for resilience against climate shocks, cyber-attacks, and geopolitical instability, prioritizing decentralized and redundant systems, with standards co-developed with the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework (`framework_drr`)**.
4. **Just Transition:** The shift away from fossil fuel infrastructure must be managed equitably, providing support, retraining, and economic alternatives for affected workers and communities, funded by the **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`).
5. **Interoperability & Modularity:** Grids and networks must be built on open standards, including sociotechnical standards for cultural interoperability (e.g., multilingual interfaces, non-Western grid designs), to ensure seamless connection across borders and technologies, preventing vendor lock-in and promoting innovation.

## 3. Systemic Integration

The Conduit Protocol serves as the primary global instrument for harmonizing infrastructure standards, nested under the legal framework of the **Treaty for Our Only Home** (`framework_treaty`), and acts as the physical layer connecting multiple GGF frameworks, translating digital and energy policy into tangible reality.

  - **Nature-Based Infrastructure Integration**: Minimum 30% of new projects incorporate ecosystem services (e.g., wetlands for water management), biomimetic grid design (e.g., mycorrhizal networks for data, watershed patterns for energy), and regenerative redundancy enhancing local ecosystems.  
  - **Cultural Resilience Integration**: Incorporates Indigenous weather prediction, water management, and sustainable technology practices, integrates local cultural crisis response protocols, and enforces absolute protection for **Sacred Site Emergency Protection Zones**.

### Pillar 2: Just Transition & Decommissioning

* **Fossil Fuel Decommissioning Trust (`institution_decom_trust`)**: Funded by a **Reparations Levy** on fossil fuel corporations (via `framework_hearthstone`) and the **GCF**, it decommissions legacy fossil fuel infrastructure and manages reparations for communities historically displaced or harmed in **Infrastructure Reparations Zones** via a **Historical Harm Assessment Protocol**. Funds **Intergenerational Repair Programs** (e.g., retrofitting lead pipes, restoring strip-mined land) in partnership with the **Justice Systems Framework** (`framework_justice_reform`), with a percentage of generated value reinvested in local cooperative enterprises via the **Community Wealth Building** requirement.
* **Just Transition Service Corps (`institution_jtsc`)**: A branch of the **Community Work Teams** (`institution_cwt`) that retrains and employs former fossil fuel workers in decommissioning, grid modernization, and ecosystem restoration, with union-equivalent wages and benefits certified by the **Work in Liberation Framework** (`framework_work_liberation`). Partners with the **Mental Health Governance Framework** (`framework_mental_health`) to provide trauma-informed care for communities near decommissioning sites. Work is rewarded via the **AUBI** system.
* **Stranded Asset Compensation Protocol (`protocol_sacp`)**: Provides fair, time-bound compensation for asset holders transitioning infrastructure into Stewardship Trusts, with valuation based on regenerative potential and reparations for displaced communities.

### Pillar 3: The Infrastructure Commons Lifecycle

* **Ethical & Cultural Design Standards**: Infrastructure design must adhere to the **Indigenous Governance Framework** (`framework_indigenous`) and **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework** (`framework_cultural_heritage`), incorporating decolonial aesthetics, **Sacred Site Avoidance Zones**, community storytelling, multilingual signage and emergency protocols, and community education in local languages to ensure cultural alignment and respect for local traditions.
* **Community Co-Design and Feedback Loops**: **Bioregional Grid Authorities** host annual, binding community feedback forums to ensure ongoing community input, with outcomes influencing performance metrics and **Regenerative Infrastructure Credits** (RICs) allocations, tracked via the **Love Ledger** (`platform_love_ledger`).
* **Community Ownership Protocol**: Managed by the **Hearthstone Protocol**, enables **Bioregional Grid Authorities** to transfer ownership stakes of local infrastructure to community-run cooperatives over time, ensuring economic benefits remain local.
* **Anti-Gentrification Protocol**: Integrated into the **Justice Impact Assessment**, models and mitigates potential displacement effects of new infrastructure, with authority to halt projects causing significant harm to existing communities.

### Pillar 4: Climate Criticality Accelerator

* **Climate Criticality Accelerator (`mechanism_cca`)**: A process where the **Planetary Health Council (`council_phc`)** identifies critical infrastructure needs for climate mitigation and adaptation (e.g., transnational renewable energy lines, flood-resistant water systems) and fast-tracks them through priority funding from the **Global Commons Fund (`mechanism_gcf`)** and streamlined approval via the **Infrastructure Planning & Permitting Process (`process_ippp`)**. Uses a Prioritization Matrix (30% climate vulnerability, 30% Indigenous co-design, 20% adaptation impact, 20% deployment speed). Includes a **Deliberative Urgency Protocol** streamlining deliberation timelines for high-scoring projects while upholding **FPIC 2.0** and justice protocols. All projects undergo a mandatory 5-year performance review by the **Planetary Health Council**, with authority to demote projects failing to meet regenerative and climate targets, revoking priority funding until realigned.

## 5. Metrics & Evaluation

To ensure accountability and progress, the framework adopts the following metrics:
