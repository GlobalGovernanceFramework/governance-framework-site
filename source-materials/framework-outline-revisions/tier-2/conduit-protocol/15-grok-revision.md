# The Conduit Protocol: A Framework for Shared Infrastructure v0.6

**Framework ID:** `framework_conduit_protocol`

**Tier:** 2

**Status:** Concept Draft

**Implementation Priority:** Critical

## 1. Vision

To transform the world's fragmented infrastructure into a unified, resilient global commons that serves as the circulatory system for planetary civilizationâ€”ensuring every community has access to clean energy, secure data networks, and clean water while respecting Indigenous sovereignty and enabling a just transition to a regenerative future.

## 2. Core Principles

This framework inherits all core GGF principles, particularly **Agility & Adaptability**, and places special emphasis on the following:

1. **Infrastructure as a Commons:** Essential physical conduits are not commodities to be owned but commons to be stewarded for the benefit of all, superseding private extractive rights.
2. **Universal Access:** All individuals and communities have a fundamental right to access the essential services provided by the infrastructure commons (energy, data, water).
3. **Resilience & Redundancy:** The network must be designed for resilience against climate shocks, cyber-attacks, and geopolitical instability, prioritizing decentralized and redundant systems, with standards co-developed with the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework (`framework_drr`)**.
4. **Just Transition:** The shift away from fossil fuel infrastructure must be managed equitably, providing support, retraining, and economic alternatives for affected workers and communities, funded by the **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`).
5. **Interoperability & Modularity:** Grids and networks must be built on open standards, including sociotechnical standards for cultural interoperability (e.g., multilingual interfaces, non-Western grid designs), to ensure seamless connection across borders and technologies, preventing vendor lock-in and promoting innovation.

## 3. Systemic Integration

The Conduit Protocol serves as the primary global instrument for harmonizing infrastructure standards, nested under the legal framework of the **Treaty for Our Only Home** (`framework_treaty`), and acts as the physical layer connecting multiple GGF frameworks, translating digital and energy policy into tangible reality.

  - **Activation Triggers**:  
    - **Level 1**: Regional grid disruption affecting >500,000 people.  
    - **Level 2**: Multi-bioregional infrastructure failure.  
    - **Level 3**: Planetary-scale threats (e.g., solar storms, cyber warfare, climate tipping points).  
  - **Emergency Powers & Safeguards**: 72-hour rapid response authority with automatic sunset, all decisions logged publicly within 24 hours, **FPIC 2.0** mandatory for Indigenous territories, and community override rights within 48 hours.  
  - **Mutual Aid Protocols**: **Grid Brotherhood Agreements** for pre-negotiated capacity sharing between **Bioregional Grid Authorities**, **Crisis Resource Pools** reserving 15% of grid capacity for emergencies, and **Analog Resilience Standards** ensuring functionality during digital failures.  
  - **Nature-Based Infrastructure Integration**: Minimum 30% of new projects incorporate ecosystem services (e.g., wetlands for water management), biomimetic grid design (e.g., mycorrhizal networks for data, watershed patterns for energy), and regenerative redundancy enhancing local ecosystems.  
  - **Cultural Resilience Integration**: Incorporates Indigenous weather prediction, water management, and sustainable technology practices, integrates local cultural crisis response protocols, and enforces absolute protection for **Sacred Site Emergency Protection Zones**.

### Pillar 2: Just Transition & Decommissioning

* **Fossil Fuel Decommissioning Trust (`institution_decom_trust`)**: Funded by a **Reparations Levy** on fossil fuel corporations (via `framework_hearthstone`) and the **GCF**, it decommissions legacy fossil fuel infrastructure and manages reparations for communities historically displaced or harmed in **Infrastructure Reparations Zones** via a **Historical Harm Assessment Protocol**. Funds **Intergenerational Repair Programs** (e.g., retrofitting lead pipes, restoring strip-mined land) in partnership with the **Justice Systems Framework** (`framework_justice_reform`), with a percentage of generated value reinvested in local cooperative enterprises via the **Community Wealth Building** requirement.
* **Just Transition Service Corps (`institution_jtsc`)**: A branch of the **Community Work Teams** (`institution_cwt`) that retrains and employs former fossil fuel workers in decommissioning, grid modernization, and ecosystem restoration, with union-equivalent wages and benefits certified by the **Work in Liberation Framework** (`framework_work_liberation`). Partners with the **Mental Health Governance Framework** (`framework_mental_health`) to provide trauma-informed care for communities near decommissioning sites. Work is rewarded via the **AUBI** system.
* **Stranded Asset Compensation Protocol (`protocol_sacp`)**: Provides fair, time-bound compensation for asset holders transitioning infrastructure into Stewardship Trusts, with valuation based on regenerative potential and reparations for displaced communities.

### Pillar 3: The Infrastructure Commons Lifecycle

* **Stewardship & Maintenance Protocol (`protocol_smp`)**: Defines responsibilities of **Bioregional Grid Authorities** to maintain and upgrade infrastructure, with performance tracked on the **Love Ledger** and rewarded with **Leaves** (`mechanism_leaves`) for ecological efficiency.
* **Ethical & Cultural Design Standards**: Infrastructure design must adhere to the **Indigenous Governance Framework** (`framework_indigenous`) and **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework** (`framework_cultural_heritage`), incorporating decolonial aesthetics, **Sacred Site Avoidance Zones**, community storytelling, multilingual signage and emergency protocols, and community education in local languages to ensure cultural alignment and respect for local traditions.
* **Community Co-Design and Feedback Loops**: **Bioregional Grid Authorities** host annual, binding community feedback forums to ensure ongoing community input, with outcomes influencing performance metrics and **Regenerative Infrastructure Credits** (RICs) allocations, tracked via the **Love Ledger** (`platform_love_ledger`).
* **Community Ownership Protocol**: Managed by the **Hearthstone Protocol**, enables **Bioregional Grid Authorities** to transfer ownership stakes of local infrastructure to community-run cooperatives over time, ensuring economic benefits remain local.
* **Anti-Gentrification Protocol**: Integrated into the **Justice Impact Assessment**, models and mitigates potential displacement effects of new infrastructure, with authority to halt projects causing significant harm to existing communities.

### Pillar 4: Climate Criticality Accelerator

* **Climate Criticality Accelerator (`mechanism_cca`)**: A process where the **Planetary Health Council (`council_phc`)** identifies critical infrastructure needs for climate mitigation and adaptation (e.g., transnational renewable energy lines, flood-resistant water systems) and fast-tracks them through priority funding from the **Global Commons Fund (`mechanism_gcf`)** and streamlined approval via the **Infrastructure Planning & Permitting Process (`process_ippp`)**. Uses a Prioritization Matrix (30% climate vulnerability, 30% Indigenous co-design, 20% adaptation impact, 20% deployment speed). Includes a **Deliberative Urgency Protocol** streamlining deliberation timelines for high-scoring projects while upholding **FPIC 2.0** and justice protocols. All projects undergo a mandatory 5-year performance review by the **Planetary Health Council**, with authority to demote projects failing to meet regenerative and climate targets, revoking priority funding until realigned.

## 5. Metrics & Evaluation

To ensure accountability and progress, the framework adopts the following metrics:

* **Universal Access Rate**: Percentage of global population with reliable access to clean energy, data, and water.

* **Humanitarian Exemption**: The **Meta-Governance Crisis Command (`process_crisis_command`)** can authorize exemptions for critical infrastructure upgrades in sanctioned regions, ensuring access to essential services.
* **Dispute Escalation Protocol**: Disputes are mediated by the **Meta-Governance Coordination Council** within 30 days, with unresolved cases escalated to the **International Commons Court** within 90 days. BAZ representatives are included in mediation, ensuring community voices are heard.

## 8. Potential Challenges & Mitigations

* **National Security Concerns:** Nations may resist ceding control over critical infrastructure.
    * **Mitigation:** Frame the protocol as enhancing national security through resilient, decentralized grids less vulnerable to single points of failure. Use the **Commons Sanctuary Protocol** (`protocol_commons_sanctuary`) and **Meta-Governance Crisis Command (`process_crisis_command`)** for mutual defense.
* **Technical Complexity:** Integrating diverse and aging grids is a massive engineering challenge.
    * **Mitigation:** Use the **Open Grid Protocol** with a modular, phased approach, starting with interoperability "gateways" between existing systems.
* **Massive Capital Investment:** Upgrading global infrastructure is costly.
    * **Mitigation:** Leverage the **Global Commons Fund**, **Commons Conversion Bonds** (via `framework_hearthstone`), public-private partnerships with **Regenerative Enterprises**, **Infrastructure Carbon Dividend**, and **Extractive Industry Transition Tax**.
* **Utility Monopolies Resistance:** Incumbent utilities may oppose decentralization.
    * **Mitigation:** Offer buyout incentives via **Hearthstone** and launch public campaigns via the **Conduit Narrative Task Force** highlighting cost savings of decentralized grids.
* **Skills Gaps in Regenerative Tech:** Lack of expertise in new technologies.
    * **Mitigation:** Partner with **Regenerative Enterprises** to launch free **Grid Academies**, funded by the **Extractive Industry Transition Tax**.
