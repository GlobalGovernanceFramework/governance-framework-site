# The Conduit Protocol: A Framework for Shared Infrastructure v0.5

**Framework ID:** `framework_conduit_protocol`

**Tier:** 2

**Status:** Concept Draft

**Implementation Priority:** Critical

## 1. Vision

To transform the world's fragmented infrastructure into a unified, resilient global commons that serves as the circulatory system for planetary civilization—ensuring every community has access to clean energy, secure data networks, and clean water while respecting Indigenous sovereignty and enabling a just transition to a regenerative future.

## 2. Core Principles

This framework inherits all core GGF principles, particularly **Agility & Adaptability**, and places special emphasis on the following:

1. **Infrastructure as a Commons:** Essential physical conduits are not commodities to be owned but commons to be stewarded for the benefit of all, superseding private extractive rights.
2. **Universal Access:** All individuals and communities have a fundamental right to access the essential services provided by the infrastructure commons (energy, data, water).
3. **Resilience & Redundancy:** The network must be designed for resilience against climate shocks, cyber-attacks, and geopolitical instability, prioritizing decentralized and redundant systems, with standards co-developed with the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework (`framework_drr`)**.
4. **Just Transition:** The shift away from fossil fuel infrastructure must be managed equitably, providing support, retraining, and economic alternatives for affected workers and communities, funded by the **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`).
5. **Interoperability & Modularity:** Grids and networks must be built on open standards, including sociotechnical standards for cultural interoperability (e.g., multilingual interfaces, non-Western grid designs), to ensure seamless connection across borders and technologies, preventing vendor lock-in and promoting innovation.

## 3. Systemic Integration

The Conduit Protocol serves as the primary global instrument for harmonizing infrastructure standards, nested under the legal framework of the **Treaty for Our Only Home** (`framework_treaty`), and acts as the physical layer connecting multiple GGF frameworks, translating digital and energy policy into tangible reality.

* **Depends On:**

## 4. Core Components & Mechanisms

### Pillar 1: Transnational Grid Governance

* **Global Infrastructure Council (`council_gic`)**: A sub-council of the **MGCC** (`council_mgcc`) responsible for setting global standards for grid interoperability, resilience, and data security. Coordinates with **Meta-Governance Crisis Command (`process_crisis_command`)** during emergencies, conducts annual grid resilience drills in partnership with the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework (`framework_drr`)**, and oversees the **Conduit Narrative Task Force** to co-develop multimedia campaigns with the **Framework Synoptic** and **Framework Indigenous** showcasing community-led infrastructure successes.
* **Bioregional Grid Authorities (`institution_bga`)**: BAZ-level or regional bodies managing local infrastructure, balancing energy loads, and implementing GIC standards. Co-governed by local communities, engineers, and ecological stewards, they allocate 10% of GCF funding to community-led innovation projects and develop **Isolated Network Protocols** for peer-to-peer energy/data sharing during emergencies. They host annual, binding community feedback forums to influence performance metrics and **Regenerative Infrastructure Credits** (RICs) allocations.
* **Open Grid Protocol (`protocol_opengrid`)**: Open-source technical standards for hardware and software, including open-source hardware designs, quantum-resistant analog backup systems, and **Analog Fallback Protocols** for critical controls to ensure functionality during cyber collapse. Includes sociotechnical standards for cultural interoperability and a neutrality protocol prohibiting infrastructure use for military aggression, enforceable by the **Digital Justice Tribunal** (`institution_dj_tribunal`).
* **AI & Automation Safeguards**: All AI used for grid management must be certified by the **Technology Governance Framework** (`framework_tech_governance`), audited for bias, and include permanent human-in-the-loop oversight for critical decisions.

### Pillar 2: Just Transition & Decommissioning

* **Fossil Fuel Decommissioning Trust (`institution_decom_trust`)**: Funded by a **Reparations Levy** on fossil fuel corporations (via `framework_hearthstone`) and the **GCF**, it decommissions legacy fossil fuel infrastructure and manages reparations for communities historically displaced or harmed in **Infrastructure Reparations Zones**, funding **Healing Infrastructure Programs** (e.g., retrofitting lead pipes, restoring strip-mined land) in partnership with the **Justice Systems Framework** (`framework_justice_reform`).
* **Just Transition Service Corps (`institution_jtsc`)**: A branch of the **Community Work Teams** (`institution_cwt`) that retrains and employs former fossil fuel workers in decommissioning, grid modernization, and ecosystem restoration, with union-equivalent wages and benefits certified by the **Work in Liberation Framework** (`framework_work_liberation`). Partners with the **Mental Health Governance Framework** (`framework_mental_health`) to provide trauma-informed care for communities near decommissioning sites. Work is rewarded via the **AUBI** system.
* **Stranded Asset Compensation Protocol (`protocol_sacp`)**: Provides fair, time-bound compensation for asset holders transitioning infrastructure into Stewardship Trusts, with valuation based on regenerative potential and reparations for displaced communities.

### Pillar 3: The Infrastructure Commons Lifecycle

* **Infrastructure Planning & Permitting Process (`process_ippp`)**: A participatory process requiring **Intergenerational Impact Assessments** (`process_iia`), **Justice Impact Assessments** (evaluating impacts on marginalized communities), and **FPIC 2.0** (`protocol_fpic2`) before projects begin. Climate-critical projects are fast-tracked via the **Climate Criticality Accelerator**. Annual community feedback forums, hosted by **Bioregional Grid Authorities**, ensure ongoing input, influencing **Regenerative Infrastructure Credits** (RICs) allocations.
* **Commons Construction Standards (`protocol_ccs`)**: Mandates sustainable, circular materials and labor practices aligned with the **Work in Liberation Framework** (`framework_work_liberation`) and **Phoenix Protocol** (`framework_phoenix`) for waste reduction and material reuse.
* **Stewardship & Maintenance Protocol (`protocol_smp`)**: Defines responsibilities of **Bioregional Grid Authorities** to maintain and upgrade infrastructure, with performance tracked on the **Love Ledger** and rewarded with **Leaves** (`mechanism_leaves`) for ecological efficiency.
* **Ethical & Cultural Design Standards**: Infrastructure design must adhere to the **Indigenous Governance Framework** (`framework_indigenous`) and **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework** (`framework_cultural_heritage`), incorporating decolonial aesthetics, **Sacred Site Avoidance Zones**, and community storytelling to ensure cultural alignment and respect for local traditions.
* **Community Co-Design and Feedback Loops**: **Bioregional Grid Authorities** host annual, binding community feedback forums to ensure ongoing community input, with outcomes influencing performance metrics and **Regenerative Infrastructure Credits** (RICs) allocations, tracked via the **Love Ledger** (`platform_love_ledger`).

### Pillar 4: Climate Criticality Accelerator

* **Climate Criticality Accelerator (`mechanism_cca`)**: A process where the **Planetary Health Council (`council_phc`)** identifies critical infrastructure needs for climate mitigation and adaptation (e.g., transnational renewable energy lines, flood-resistant water systems) and fast-tracks them through priority funding from the **Global Commons Fund (`mechanism_gcf`)** and streamlined approval via the **Infrastructure Planning & Permitting Process (`process_ippp`)**. Uses a Prioritization Matrix (30% climate vulnerability, 30% Indigenous co-design, 20% adaptation impact, 20% deployment speed). All projects undergo a mandatory 5-year performance review by the **Planetary Health Council**, with authority to demote projects failing to meet regenerative and climate targets, revoking priority funding until realigned. All projects uphold **FPIC 2.0** and other justice protocols.

## 5. Metrics & Evaluation

To ensure accountability and progress, the framework adopts the following metrics:

* **Universal Access Rate**: Percentage of global population with reliable access to clean energy, data, and water.
* **Grid Resilience Index**: Ability to maintain service during shock scenarios, co-developed with the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework (`framework_drr`)**.
* **Regenerative Impact Score**: Measures how much infrastructure enhances vs. degrades local ecosystems.
* **Just Transition Completeness**: Percentage of fossil fuel workers successfully retrained and employed.
* **Commons Health Contribution**: Impact of infrastructure performance on the **Biosphere Health Index (`metric_bhi`)** and **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (`metric_lmci`)** in served regions.
* **Sovereignty Index**: Percentage of infrastructure decisions made by local communities vs. centralized bodies.
* **Energy Democracy Score**: Measures the proportion of energy generation/storage that is community-controlled.
* **Cybersecurity Transparency**: Public log of all breaches and resolutions, integrated with the **Aurora Accord**.
* **Wellbeing Infrastructure Score**: Measures infrastructure’s impact on mental health and community wellbeing, developed with the **Mental Health Governance Framework** (`framework_mental_health`).
* **Infrastructure Legitimacy Index**: Assesses perceived fairness, participation, and cultural fit of infrastructure projects, co-designed with local BAZs or community councils.
* **Circular Economy Index**: Measures use of recycled materials, waste reduction, and lifecycle sustainability, audited by the **Global Infrastructure Council** (`council_gic`) and aligned with the **Phoenix Protocol** (`framework_phoenix`).

## 6. Financial Mechanisms

* **Infrastructure Carbon Dividend**: Revenue from carbon pricing directed to grid decarbonization, managed via the **Global Commons Fund (`mechanism_gcf`)** and tracked on a real-time transparency dashboard integrated with the **Love Ledger**.
* **Extractive Industry Transition Tax**: A levy on fossil fuel companies to fund their transformation, implemented via the **Corporate Reparations Protocol** (`framework_hearthstone`).
* **Regenerative Infrastructure Credits (RICs)**: Non-extractive, non-transferable community equity instruments governed by the **Regenerative Financial Systems Framework** (`framework_financial_systems`) to prevent speculative bubbles, tied to project equity or community benefit, and potentially linked to the **Hearts/Leaves** system.
* **Microgrid Incentives**: Communities developing approved microgrids receive **Leaves** (`mechanism_leaves`) via the **Love Ledger** (`platform_love_ledger`).

## 7. Sovereignty and Dispute Resolution

* **National Security Oversight**: National governments retain security oversight but must adhere to the **Open Grid Protocol** and ensure transparency. Measures violating Universal Access require a ruling from the **Digital Justice Tribunal** (`institution_dj_tribunal`).
* **Dispute Resolution**: Disputes between Bioregional Grid Authorities and national governments are mediated by the **Meta-Governance Coordination Council (`council_mgcc`)**, with escalation to the **International Commons Court (`institution_icc`)** if unresolved.
* **Indigenous Sovereignty in Emergencies**: Emergency protocols impacting Indigenous territories require activation of **FPIC 2.0 (`protocol_fpic2`)**, even on accelerated timelines, with the **Earth Council (`council_earth`)** holding veto power.
* **Humanitarian Exemption**: The **Meta-Governance Crisis Command (`process_crisis_command`)** can authorize exemptions for critical infrastructure upgrades in sanctioned regions, ensuring access to essential services.
* **Dispute Escalation Protocol**: Disputes are mediated by the **Meta-Governance Coordination Council** within 30 days, with unresolved cases escalated to the **International Commons Court** within 90 days. BAZ representatives are included in mediation, ensuring community voices are heard.

## 8. Potential Challenges & Mitigations

* **National Security Concerns:** Nations may resist ceding control over critical infrastructure.
    * **Mitigation:** Frame the protocol as enhancing national security through resilient, decentralized grids less vulnerable to single points of failure. Use the **Commons Sanctuary Protocol** (`protocol_commons_sanctuary`) and **Meta-Governance Crisis Command (`process_crisis_command`)** for mutual defense.
* **Technical Complexity:** Integrating diverse and aging grids is a massive engineering challenge.
    * **Mitigation:** Use the **Open Grid Protocol** with a modular, phased approach, starting with interoperability "gateways" between existing systems.
* **Massive Capital Investment:** Upgrading global infrastructure is costly.
    * **Mitigation:** Leverage the **Global Commons Fund**, **Commons Conversion Bonds** (via `framework_hearthstone`), public-private partnerships with **Regenerative Enterprises**, **Infrastructure Carbon Dividend**, and **Extractive Industry Transition Tax**.
* **Utility Monopolies Resistance:** Incumbent utilities may oppose decentralization.
    * **Mitigation:** Offer buyout incentives via **Hearthstone** and launch public campaigns via the **Conduit Narrative Task Force** highlighting cost savings of decentralized grids.
* **Skills Gaps in Regenerative Tech:** Lack of expertise in new technologies.
    * **Mitigation:** Partner with **Regenerative Enterprises** to launch free **Grid Academies**, funded by the **Extractive Industry Transition Tax**.
