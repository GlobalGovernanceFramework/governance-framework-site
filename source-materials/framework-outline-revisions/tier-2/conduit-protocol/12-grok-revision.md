# The Conduit Protocol: A Framework for Shared Infrastructure v0.5

**Framework ID:** `framework_conduit_protocol`

**Tier:** 2

**Status:** Concept Draft

**Implementation Priority:** Critical

## 1. Vision

To transform the world's fragmented infrastructure into a unified, resilient global commons that serves as the circulatory system for planetary civilizationâ€”ensuring every community has access to clean energy, secure data networks, and clean water while respecting Indigenous sovereignty and enabling a just transition to a regenerative future.

## 2. Core Principles

This framework inherits all core GGF principles, particularly **Agility & Adaptability**, and places special emphasis on the following:

1. **Infrastructure as a Commons:** Essential physical conduits are not commodities to be owned but commons to be stewarded for the benefit of all, superseding private extractive rights.
2. **Universal Access:** All individuals and communities have a fundamental right to access the essential services provided by the infrastructure commons (energy, data, water).
3. **Resilience & Redundancy:** The network must be designed for resilience against climate shocks, cyber-attacks, and geopolitical instability, prioritizing decentralized and redundant systems, with standards co-developed with the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework (`framework_drr`)**.
4. **Just Transition:** The shift away from fossil fuel infrastructure must be managed equitably, providing support, retraining, and economic alternatives for affected workers and communities, funded by the **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`).
5. **Interoperability & Modularity:** Grids and networks must be built on open standards, including sociotechnical standards for cultural interoperability (e.g., multilingual interfaces, non-Western grid designs), to ensure seamless connection across borders and technologies, preventing vendor lock-in and promoting innovation.

## 3. Systemic Integration

The Conduit Protocol serves as the primary global instrument for harmonizing infrastructure standards, nested under the legal framework of the **Treaty for Our Only Home** (`framework_treaty`), and acts as the physical layer connecting multiple GGF frameworks, translating digital and energy policy into tangible reality.

* **Depends On:**

    * **`process_crisis_command`**: Supports the **Meta-Governance Crisis Command** by ensuring infrastructure resilience and humanitarian exemptions during emergencies.

## 4. Core Components & Mechanisms

### Pillar 1: Transnational Grid Governance

* **Global Infrastructure Council (`council_gic`)**: A sub-council of the **MGCC** (`council_mgcc`) responsible for setting global standards for grid interoperability, resilience, and data security. Coordinates with **Meta-Governance Crisis Command (`process_crisis_command`)** during emergencies, conducts annual grid resilience drills in partnership with the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework (`framework_drr`)**, and oversees the **Conduit Narrative Task Force** to co-develop multimedia campaigns with the **Framework Synoptic** and **Framework Indigenous** showcasing community-led infrastructure successes.
* **Bioregional Grid Authorities (`institution_bga`)**: BAZ-level or regional bodies managing local infrastructure, balancing energy loads, and implementing GIC standards. Co-governed by local communities, engineers, and ecological stewards, they allocate 10% of GCF funding to community-led innovation projects and develop **Isolated Network Protocols** for peer-to-peer energy/data sharing during emergencies. They host annual, binding community feedback forums to influence performance metrics and **Regenerative Infrastructure Credits** (RICs) allocations.
* **Open Grid Protocol (`protocol_opengrid`)**: Open-source technical standards for hardware and software, including open-source hardware designs, quantum-resistant analog backup systems, and **Analog Fallback Protocols** for critical controls to ensure functionality during cyber collapse. Includes sociotechnical standards for cultural interoperability and a neutrality protocol prohibiting infrastructure use for military aggression, enforceable by the **Digital Justice Tribunal** (`institution_dj_tribunal`).
* **AI & Automation Safeguards**: All AI used for grid management must be certified by the **Technology Governance Framework** (`framework_tech_governance`), audited for bias, and include permanent human-in-the-loop oversight for critical decisions.

### Pillar 2: Just Transition & Decommissioning

* **Fossil Fuel Decommissioning Trust (`institution_decom_trust`)**: Funded by a **Reparations Levy** on fossil fuel corporations (via `framework_hearthstone`) and the **GCF**, it decommissions legacy fossil fuel infrastructure and manages reparations for communities historically displaced or harmed in **Infrastructure Reparations Zones**, funding **Healing Infrastructure Programs** (e.g., retrofitting lead pipes, restoring strip-mined land) in partnership with the **Justice Systems Framework** (`framework_justice_reform`).
* **Just Transition Service Corps (`institution_jtsc`)**: A branch of the **Community Work Teams** (`institution_cwt`) that retrains and employs former fossil fuel workers in decommissioning, grid modernization, and ecosystem restoration, with union-equivalent wages and benefits certified by the **Work in Liberation Framework** (`framework_work_liberation`). Partners with the **Mental Health Governance Framework** (`framework_mental_health`) to provide trauma-informed care for communities near decommissioning sites. Work is rewarded via the **AUBI** system.
* **Stranded Asset Compensation Protocol (`protocol_sacp`)**: Provides fair, time-bound compensation for asset holders transitioning infrastructure into Stewardship Trusts, with valuation based on regenerative potential and reparations for displaced communities.

### Pillar 3: The Infrastructure Commons Lifecycle

* **Infrastructure Planning & Permitting Process (`process_ippp`)**: A participatory process requiring **Intergenerational Impact Assessments** (`process_iia`), **Justice Impact Assessments** (evaluating impacts on marginalized communities), and **FPIC 2.0** (`protocol_fpic2`) before projects begin. Climate-critical projects are fast-tracked via the **Climate Criticality Accelerator**. Annual community feedback forums, hosted by **Bioregional Grid Authorities**, ensure ongoing input, influencing **Regenerative Infrastructure Credits** (RICs) allocations.
* **Commons Construction Standards (`protocol_ccs`)**: Mandates sustainable, circular materials and labor practices aligned with the **Work in Liberation Framework** (`framework_work_liberation`) and **Phoenix Protocol** (`framework_phoenix`) for waste reduction and material reuse.
* **Stewardship & Maintenance Protocol (`protocol_smp`)**: Defines responsibilities of **Bioregional Grid Authorities** to maintain and upgrade infrastructure, with performance tracked on the **Love Ledger** and rewarded with **Leaves** (`mechanism_leaves`) for ecological efficiency.
* **Ethical & Cultural Design Standards**: Infrastructure design must adhere to the **Indigenous Governance Framework** (`framework_indigenous`) and **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework** (`framework_cultural_heritage`), incorporating decolonial aesthetics, **Sacred Site Avoidance Zones**, and community storytelling to ensure cultural alignment and respect for local traditions.
* **Community Co-Design and Feedback Loops**: **Bioregional Grid Authorities** host annual, binding community feedback forums to ensure ongoing community input, with outcomes influencing performance metrics and **Regenerative Infrastructure Credits** (RICs) allocations, tracked via the **Love Ledger** (`platform_love_ledger`).

### Pillar 4: Climate Criticality Accelerator

* **Climate Criticality Accelerator (`mechanism_cca`)**: A process where the **Planetary Health Council (`council_phc`)** identifies critical infrastructure needs for climate mitigation and adaptation (e.g., transnational renewable energy lines, flood-resistant water systems) and fast-tracks them through priority funding from the **Global Commons Fund (`mechanism_gcf`)** and streamlined approval via the **Infrastructure Planning & Permitting Process (`process_ippp`)**. Uses a Prioritization Matrix (30% climate vulnerability, 30% Indigenous co-design, 20% adaptation impact, 20% deployment speed). All projects undergo a mandatory 5-year performance review by the **Planetary Health Council**, with authority to demote projects failing to meet regenerative and climate targets, revoking priority funding until realigned. All projects uphold **FPIC 2.0** and other justice protocols.

## 5. Metrics & Evaluation

To ensure accountability and progress, the framework adopts the following metrics:

* **Universal Access Rate**: Percentage of global population with reliable access to clean energy, data, and water.
* **Grid Resilience Index**: Ability to maintain service during shock scenarios, co-developed with the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework (`framework_drr`)**.
* **Regenerative Impact Score**: Measures how much infrastructure enhances vs. degrades local ecosystems.
* **Just Transition Completeness**: Percentage of fossil fuel workers successfully retrained and employed.
* **Commons Health Contribution**: Impact of infrastructure performance on the **Biosphere Health Index (`metric_bhi`)** and **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (`metric_lmci`)** in served regions.
* **Sovereignty Index**: Percentage of infrastructure decisions made by local communities vs. centralized bodies.
* **Energy Democracy Score**: Measures the proportion of energy generation/storage that is community-controlled.
* **Cybersecurity Transparency**: Public log of all breaches and resolutions, integrated with the **Aurora Accord**.
* **Wellbeing Infrastructure Score**: Measures infrastructureâ€™s impact on mental health and community wellbeing, developed with the **Mental Health Governance Framework** (`framework_mental_health`).
* **Infrastructure Legitimacy Index**: Assesses perceived fairness, participation, and cultural fit of infrastructure projects, co-designed with local BAZs or community councils.
* **Circular Economy Index**: Measures use of recycled materials, waste reduction, and lifecycle sustainability, audited by the **Global Infrastructure Council** (`council_gic`) and aligned with the **Phoenix Protocol** (`framework_phoenix`).

## 6. Financial Mechanisms

* **Infrastructure Carbon Dividend**: Revenue from carbon pricing directed to grid decarbonization, managed via the **Global Commons Fund (`mechanism_gcf`)** and tracked on a real-time transparency dashboard integrated with the **Love Ledger**.
* **Extractive Industry Transition Tax**: A levy on fossil fuel companies to fund their transformation, implemented via the **Corporate Reparations Protocol** (`framework_hearthstone`).
* **Regenerative Infrastructure Credits (RICs)**: Non-extractive, non-transferable community equity instruments governed by the **Regenerative Financial Systems Framework** (`framework_financial_systems`) to prevent speculative bubbles, tied to project equity or community benefit, and potentially linked to the **Hearts/Leaves** system.
* **Microgrid Incentives**: Communities developing approved microgrids receive **Leaves** (`mechanism_leaves`) via the **Love Ledger** (`platform_love_ledger`).

## 7. Sovereignty and Dispute Resolution

* **National Security Oversight**: National governments retain security oversight but must adhere to the **Open Grid Protocol** and ensure transparency. Measures violating Universal Access require a ruling from the **Digital Justice Tribunal** (`institution_dj_tribunal`).
* **Dispute Resolution**: Disputes between Bioregional Grid Authorities and national governments are mediated by the **Meta-Governance Coordination Council (`council_mgcc`)**, with escalation to the **International Commons Court (`institution_icc`)** if unresolved.
* **Indigenous Sovereignty in Emergencies**: Emergency protocols impacting Indigenous territories require activation of **FPIC 2.0 (`protocol_fpic2`)**, even on accelerated timelines, with the **Earth Council (`council_earth`)** holding veto power.
* **Humanitarian Exemption**: The **Meta-Governance Crisis Command (`process_crisis_command`)** can authorize exemptions for critical infrastructure upgrades in sanctioned regions, ensuring access to essential services.
* **Dispute Escalation Protocol**: Disputes are mediated by the **Meta-Governance Coordination Council** within 30 days, with unresolved cases escalated to the **International Commons Court** within 90 days. BAZ representatives are included in mediation, ensuring community voices are heard.

## 8. Potential Challenges & Mitigations

* **National Security Concerns:** Nations may resist ceding control over critical infrastructure.
    * **Mitigation:** Frame the protocol as enhancing national security through resilient, decentralized grids less vulnerable to single points of failure. Use the **Commons Sanctuary Protocol** (`protocol_commons_sanctuary`) and **Meta-Governance Crisis Command (`process_crisis_command`)** for mutual defense.
* **Technical Complexity:** Integrating diverse and aging grids is a massive engineering challenge.
    * **Mitigation:** Use the **Open Grid Protocol** with a modular, phased approach, starting with interoperability "gateways" between existing systems.
* **Massive Capital Investment:** Upgrading global infrastructure is costly.
    * **Mitigation:** Leverage the **Global Commons Fund**, **Commons Conversion Bonds** (via `framework_hearthstone`), public-private partnerships with **Regenerative Enterprises**, **Infrastructure Carbon Dividend**, and **Extractive Industry Transition Tax**.
* **Utility Monopolies Resistance:** Incumbent utilities may oppose decentralization.
    * **Mitigation:** Offer buyout incentives via **Hearthstone** and launch public campaigns via the **Conduit Narrative Task Force** highlighting cost savings of decentralized grids.
* **Skills Gaps in Regenerative Tech:** Lack of expertise in new technologies.
    * **Mitigation:** Partner with **Regenerative Enterprises** to launch free **Grid Academies**, funded by the **Extractive Industry Transition Tax**.
