# The Conduit Protocol: A Framework for Shared Infrastructure v1.0

**Framework ID:** `framework_conduit_protocol`

**Tier:** 2

**Status:** Final Draft

**Implementation Priority:** Critical

## 1. Vision

To transform the world's fragmented infrastructure into a unified, resilient global commons that serves as the circulatory system for planetary civilization—ensuring every community has access to clean energy, secure data networks, and clean water while respecting Indigenous sovereignty and enabling a just transition to a regenerative future.

## 2. Core Principles

This framework inherits all core GGF principles, particularly **Agility & Adaptability**, and places special emphasis on the following:

1. **Infrastructure as a Commons:** Essential physical conduits are not commodities to be owned but commons to be stewarded for the benefit of all, superseding private extractive rights.
2. **Universal Access:** All individuals and communities have a fundamental right to access the essential services provided by the infrastructure commons (energy, data, water).
3. **Resilience & Redundancy:** The network must be designed for resilience against climate shocks, cyber-attacks, geopolitical instability, and sabotage, prioritizing decentralized and redundant systems, with standards co-developed with the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework (`framework_drr`)**.
4. **Just Transition:** The shift away from fossil fuel infrastructure must be managed equitably, providing support, retraining, and economic alternatives for affected workers and communities, funded by the **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`).
5. **Interoperability & Modularity:** Grids and networks must be built on open standards, including sociotechnical standards for cultural interoperability (e.g., multilingual interfaces, non-Western grid designs), to ensure seamless connection across borders and technologies, preventing vendor lock-in and promoting innovation.

## 3. Systemic Integration

The Conduit Protocol serves as the primary global instrument for harmonizing infrastructure standards, nested under the legal framework of the **Treaty for Our Only Home** (`framework_treaty`), and acts as the physical layer connecting multiple GGF frameworks, translating digital and energy policy into tangible reality.

## 4. Core Components & Mechanisms

### Pillar 1: Transnational Grid Governance

* **Global Infrastructure Council (`council_gic`)**: A sub-council of the **MGCC** (`council_mgcc`) responsible for setting global standards for grid interoperability, resilience, and data security. Coordinates with **Meta-Governance Crisis Command (`process_crisis_command`)** during emergencies, conducts annual grid resilience drills in partnership with the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework (`framework_drr`)**, and oversees the **Conduit Narrative Task Force** to co-develop multimedia campaigns with the **Framework Synoptic** and **Framework Indigenous** showcasing community-led infrastructure successes. All members must submit **Conflict-of-Interest Disclosures**, enforceable by the **Digital Justice Tribunal** (`institution_dj_tribunal`) with penalties including removal from office and financial restitution.
* **Bioregional Grid Authorities (`institution_bga`)**: BAZ-level or regional bodies managing local infrastructure, balancing energy loads, and implementing GIC standards. Co-governed by local communities (minimum 40% community representation), engineers, and ecological stewards, they allocate 10% of GCF funding to community-led innovation projects, develop **Isolated Network Protocols** for peer-to-peer energy/data sharing during emergencies, and host annual, binding community feedback forums to influence performance metrics and **Regenerative Infrastructure Credits** (RICs) allocations. All financial decisions are publicly logged and audited via the **Infrastructure Integrity Protocol**. Persistent underperformance (failing >50% of metrics for 2 consecutive years) triggers temporary stewardship by the **Office of Commons Transition** (`office_commons_transition`) with mandatory community-led restructuring within 12 months.
* **Open Grid Protocol (`protocol_opengrid`)**: Open-source technical standards for hardware and software, including open-source hardware designs, quantum-resistant infrastructure design (certified by the **Quantum Governance Lab** with updates every 24 months, adopted within 12 months for new projects), analog backup systems, and **Analog Fallback Protocols** (using manual overrides and mechanical systems to maintain 50% service capacity during cyber collapse, prioritizing hospitals, emergency services, public water/sanitation, and food distribution networks). Includes sociotechnical standards for cultural interoperability, a neutrality protocol prohibiting infrastructure use for military aggression (enforceable by the **Digital Justice Tribunal** with penalties including asset seizure, funding suspension, or international sanctions), a **Community Technology Sovereignty** clause allowing BAZs to opt out of smart grid technologies via community-led decisions, and a **Language Justice** clause requiring user-facing interfaces and emergency protocols in the top 3 most-spoken languages per BAZ, with GCF funding for minority language preservation.
* **AI & Automation Safeguards**: All AI used for grid management must be certified by the **Technology Governance Framework** (`framework_tech_governance`), audited for bias, include permanent human-in-the-loop oversight for critical decisions, and provide public transparency reports via the **Aurora Accord** detailing training dataset sources, core algorithm logic, and logs of critical decisions. BAZ councils have the right to demand independent, human-led audits of AI decisions affecting their territory.
* **Crisis Infrastructure Command (`institution_cic`)**: Chartered by the **Global Infrastructure Council** and activated by the **Meta-Governance Crisis Command** to manage infrastructure during crises.  
  - **Activation Triggers**:  
    - **Level 1**: Regional grid disruption affecting >500,000 people.

  - **Emergency Powers & Safeguards**: 72-hour rapid response authority with automatic sunset, all decisions logged publicly within 24 hours, **FPIC 2.0** mandatory for Indigenous territories, and community override via a simple majority vote for non-critical directives or 2/3 majority for critical life-support systems (e.g., hospital power) within 72 hours, with appeals processed within 24 hours by the **Digital Justice Tribunal**. Indigenous communities may use traditional consensus processes for overrides.  
  - **Mutual Aid Protocols**: **Grid Brotherhood Agreements** with default terms mandating reciprocal energy sharing up to 15% of a BGA’s capacity during Level 1 or 2 crises, **Crisis Resource Pools** reserving 15% of grid capacity for emergencies, and **Analog Resilience Standards** ensuring functionality during digital failures.  
  - **Sabotage Mitigation Protocol**: Addresses deliberate attacks (e.g., corporate/state-sponsored grid vandalism) with forensic audits by the **Quantum Governance Lab**, immediate isolation of affected systems, and reparations from perpetrators enforced by the **Digital Justice Tribunal**. Includes preemptive vulnerability assessments and community training for sabotage detection.  
  - **Nature-Based Infrastructure Integration**: Minimum 30% of new projects incorporate ecosystem services (e.g., wetlands for water management), biomimetic grid design (e.g., mycorrhizal networks for data, watershed patterns for energy), and regenerative redundancy enhancing local ecosystems.  
  - **Cultural Resilience Integration**: Incorporates Indigenous weather prediction, water management, and sustainable technology practices, integrates local cultural crisis response protocols, and enforces absolute protection for **Sacred Site Emergency Protection Zones** designated by the **Earth Council** (`council_earth`) based on Indigenous petitions.  
  - **Post-Crisis Reconciliation**: After Level 2 or 3 actions, public hearings within 30 days, managed by the **Justice Systems Framework** (`framework_justice_reform`) with at least 40% representation from affected communities, assess harm, determine reparations (funded by the **Global Commons Fund**), and integrate lessons into future protocols.
* **Infrastructure Integrity Protocol**: Mandates public audits of all **Bioregional Grid Authority** financial decisions via the **Aurora Accord** transparency dashboard, whistleblower protections under the **Justice Systems Framework** (`framework_justice_reform`), and **Conflict-of-Interest Disclosures** for **Global Infrastructure Council** members, enforceable by the **Digital Justice Tribunal** with penalties including fines and removal from office.

### Pillar 2: Just Transition & Decommissioning

* **Fossil Fuel Decommissioning Trust (`institution_decom_trust`)**: Funded by a **Reparations Levy** on fossil fuel corporations (via `framework_hearthstone`) and the **GCF**, it decommissions legacy fossil fuel infrastructure and manages reparations for communities historically displaced or harmed in **Infrastructure Reparations Zones** via a **Historical Harm Assessment Protocol**. Funds **Intergenerational Repair Programs** (e.g., retrofitting lead pipes, restoring strip-mined land) in partnership with the **Justice Systems Framework** (`framework_justice_reform`), with a percentage of generated value reinvested in local cooperative enterprises via the **Community Wealth Building** requirement.
* **Just Transition Service Corps (`institution_jtsc`)**: A branch of the **Community Work Teams** (`institution_cwt`) that retrains and employs former fossil fuel workers in decommissioning, grid modernization, and ecosystem restoration, with union-equivalent wages and benefits certified by the **Work in Liberation Framework** (`framework_work_liberation`). Partners with the **Mental Health Governance Framework** (`framework_mental_health`) to provide trauma-informed care for communities near decommissioning sites. Work is rewarded via the **AUBI** system.
* **Stranded Asset Compensation Protocol (`protocol_sacp`)**: Provides fair, time-bound compensation for asset holders transitioning infrastructure into Stewardship Trusts, with valuation based on regenerative potential and reparations for displaced communities.

### Pillar 3: The Infrastructure Commons Lifecycle

* **Infrastructure Planning & Permitting Process (`process_ippp`)**: A participatory process requiring **Intergenerational Impact Assessments** (`process_iia`), **Justice Impact Assessments** (evaluating impacts on marginalized communities), **FPIC 2.0** (`protocol_fpic2`), and a **Decolonial Design Review** co-led by local BAZs and the **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework** (`framework_cultural_heritage`). Includes a **Traditional Technology Integration Protocol** to blend Indigenous and modern technologies. Climate-critical projects are fast-tracked via the **Climate Criticality Accelerator**.

* **Community Ownership Protocol**: Managed by the **Hearthstone Protocol**, enables **Bioregional Grid Authorities** to transfer 25% ownership stakes of new infrastructure to community-run cooperatives within 10 years of operation, with pathways to 51% ownership over 25 years, contingent on communities meeting GCF-funded stewardship capacity training requirements. Communities opting out of ownership responsibilities may designate a trusted BGA or cooperative to manage their stake.
* **Anti-Gentrification Protocol**: Integrated into the **Justice Impact Assessment**, models and mitigates potential displacement effects of new infrastructure, with authority to halt projects causing significant harm to existing communities.

### Pillar 4: Climate Criticality Accelerator

* **Climate Criticality Accelerator (`mechanism_cca`)**: A process where the **Planetary Health Council (`council_phc`)** identifies critical infrastructure needs for climate mitigation and adaptation (e.g., transnational renewable energy lines, flood-resistant water systems) and fast-tracks them through priority funding from the **Global Commons Fund (`mechanism_gcf`)** and streamlined approval via the **Infrastructure Planning & Permitting Process (`process_ippp`)**. Uses a Prioritization Matrix (30% climate vulnerability, 30% Indigenous co-design, 20% adaptation impact, 20% deployment speed). Includes a **Deliberative Urgency Protocol** streamlining deliberation timelines for high-scoring projects while upholding **FPIC 2.0** and justice protocols. All projects undergo a mandatory 5-year performance review by the **Planetary Health Council**, with authority to demote projects failing to meet regenerative and climate targets, revoking priority funding until realigned.
* **Climate Refugee Infrastructure Protocol**: Pre-plans adaptive infrastructure (e.g., modular housing, mobile water purification, resilient microgrids) for displacement hotspots (e.g., coastal cities, drought zones), co-designed with affected communities and the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework** (`framework_drr`), prioritizing rapid deployment and cultural sensitivity.

## 5. Metrics & Evaluation
