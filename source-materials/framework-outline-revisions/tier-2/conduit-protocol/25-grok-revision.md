# The Conduit Protocol: A Framework for Shared Infrastructure v1.0

**Framework ID:** `framework_conduit_protocol`

**Tier:** 2

**Status:** Final Draft

**Implementation Priority:** Critical

## 1. Vision

To transform the world's fragmented infrastructure into a unified, resilient global commons that serves as the circulatory system for planetary civilizationâ€”ensuring every community has access to clean energy, secure data networks, and clean water while respecting Indigenous sovereignty and enabling a just transition to a regenerative future.

## 2. Core Principles

This framework inherits all core GGF principles, particularly **Agility & Adaptability**, and places special emphasis on the following:

1. **Infrastructure as a Commons:** Essential physical conduits are not commodities to be owned but commons to be stewarded for the benefit of all, superseding private extractive rights.
2. **Universal Access:** All individuals and communities have a fundamental right to access the essential services provided by the infrastructure commons (energy, data, water).
3. **Resilience & Redundancy:** The network must be designed for resilience against climate shocks, cyber-attacks, geopolitical instability, and sabotage, prioritizing decentralized and redundant systems, with standards co-developed with the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework (`framework_drr`)**.
4. **Just Transition:** The shift away from fossil fuel infrastructure must be managed equitably, providing support, retraining, and economic alternatives for affected workers and communities, funded by the **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`).
5. **Interoperability & Modularity:** Grids and networks must be built on open standards, including sociotechnical standards for cultural interoperability (e.g., multilingual interfaces, non-Western grid designs), to ensure seamless connection across borders and technologies, preventing vendor lock-in and promoting innovation.

## 3. Systemic Integration

The Conduit Protocol serves as the primary global instrument for harmonizing infrastructure standards, nested under the legal framework of the **Treaty for Our Only Home** (`framework_treaty`), and acts as the physical layer connecting multiple GGF frameworks, translating digital and energy policy into tangible reality.

## 4. Core Components & Mechanisms

### Pillar 1: Transnational Grid Governance

* **Global Infrastructure Council (`council_gic`)**: A sub-council of the **MGCC** (`council_mgcc`) responsible for setting global standards for grid interoperability, resilience, and data security. Coordinates with **Meta-Governance Crisis Command (`process_crisis_command`)** during emergencies, conducts annual grid resilience drills in partnership with the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework (`framework_drr`)**, and oversees the **Conduit Narrative Task Force** to co-develop multimedia campaigns with the **Framework Synoptic** and **Framework Indigenous** showcasing community-led infrastructure successes. All members must submit **Conflict-of-Interest Disclosures**, enforceable by the **Digital Justice Tribunal** (`institution_dj_tribunal`) with penalties including removal from office and financial restitution.
* **Bioregional Grid Authorities (`institution_bga`)**: BAZ-level or regional bodies managing local infrastructure, balancing energy loads, and implementing GIC standards. Co-governed by local communities (minimum 40% community representation), engineers, and ecological stewards, they allocate 10% of GCF funding to community-led innovation projects, develop **Isolated Network Protocols** for peer-to-peer energy/data sharing during emergencies, and host annual, binding community feedback forums to influence performance metrics and **Regenerative Infrastructure Credits** (RICs) allocations. All financial decisions are publicly logged and audited via the **Infrastructure Integrity Protocol**. Persistent underperformance (failing >50% of metrics for 2 consecutive years) triggers temporary stewardship by the **Office of Commons Transition** (`office_commons_transition`) with mandatory community-led restructuring within 12 months.
* **Open Grid Protocol (`protocol_opengrid`)**: Open-source technical standards for hardware and software, including open-source hardware designs, quantum-resistant infrastructure design (certified by the **Quantum Governance Lab** with updates every 24 months, adopted within 12 months for new projects), analog backup systems, and **Analog Fallback Protocols** (using manual overrides and mechanical systems to maintain 50% service capacity during cyber collapse, prioritizing hospitals, emergency services, public water/sanitation, and food distribution networks). Includes sociotechnical standards for cultural interoperability, a neutrality protocol prohibiting infrastructure use for military aggression (enforceable by the **Digital Justice Tribunal** with penalties including asset seizure, funding suspension, or international sanctions), a **Community Technology Sovereignty** clause allowing BAZs to opt out of smart grid technologies via community-led decisions, and a **Language Justice** clause requiring user-facing interfaces and emergency protocols in the top 3 most-spoken languages per BAZ, with GCF funding for minority language preservation.
* **AI & Automation Safeguards**: All AI used for grid management must be certified by the **Technology Governance Framework** (`framework_tech_governance`), audited for bias, include permanent human-in-the-loop oversight for critical decisions, and provide public transparency reports via the **Aurora Accord** detailing training dataset sources, core algorithm logic, and logs of critical decisions. BAZ councils have the right to demand independent, human-led audits of AI decisions affecting their territory.
* **Crisis Infrastructure Command (`institution_cic`)**: Chartered by the **Global Infrastructure Council** and activated by the **Meta-Governance Crisis Command** to manage infrastructure during crises.  
  - **Activation Triggers**:  
    - **Level 1**: Regional grid disruption affecting >500,000 people.  
    - **Level 2**: Multi-bioregional infrastructure failure.  
    - **Level 3**: Planetary-scale threats (e.g., solar storms, cyber warfare, climate tipping points, sabotage).  
  - **Emergency Powers & Safeguards**: 72-hour rapid response authority with automatic sunset, all decisions logged publicly within 24 hours, **FPIC 2.0** mandatory for Indigenous territories, and community override via a simple majority vote for non-critical directives or 2/3 majority for critical life-support systems (e.g., hospital power) within 72 hours, with appeals processed within 24 hours by the **Digital Justice Tribunal**. Indigenous communities may use traditional consensus processes for overrides.  
  - **Mutual Aid Protocols**: **Grid Brotherhood Agreements** with default terms mandating reciprocal energy sharing up to 15% of a BGAâ€™s capacity during Level 1 or 2 crises, **Crisis Resource Pools** reserving 15% of grid capacity for emergencies, and **Analog Resilience Standards** ensuring functionality during digital failures.  
  - **Sabotage Mitigation Protocol**: Addresses deliberate attacks (e.g., corporate/state-sponsored grid vandalism) with forensic audits by the **Quantum Governance Lab**, immediate isolation of affected systems, and reparations from perpetrators enforced by the **Digital Justice Tribunal**. Includes preemptive vulnerability assessments and community training for sabotage detection.  
  - **Nature-Based Infrastructure Integration**: Minimum 30% of new projects incorporate ecosystem services (e.g., wetlands for water management), biomimetic grid design (e.g., mycorrhizal networks for data, watershed patterns for energy), and regenerative redundancy enhancing local ecosystems.  
  - **Cultural Resilience Integration**: Incorporates Indigenous weather prediction, water management, and sustainable technology practices, integrates local cultural crisis response protocols, and enforces absolute protection for **Sacred Site Emergency Protection Zones** designated by the **Earth Council** (`council_earth`) based on Indigenous petitions.  
  - **Post-Crisis Reconciliation**: After Level 2 or 3 actions, public hearings within 30 days, managed by the **Justice Systems Framework** (`framework_justice_reform`) with at least 40% representation from affected communities, assess harm, determine reparations (funded by the **Global Commons Fund**), and integrate lessons into future protocols.
* **Infrastructure Integrity Protocol**: Mandates public audits of all **Bioregional Grid Authority** financial decisions via the **Aurora Accord** transparency dashboard, whistleblower protections under the **Justice Systems Framework** (`framework_justice_reform`), and **Conflict-of-Interest Disclosures** for **Global Infrastructure Council** members, enforceable by the **Digital Justice Tribunal** with penalties including fines and removal from office.

### Pillar 2: Just Transition & Decommissioning

* **Fossil Fuel Decommissioning Trust (`institution_decom_trust`)**: Funded by a **Reparations Levy** on fossil fuel corporations (via `framework_hearthstone`) and the **GCF**, it decommissions legacy fossil fuel infrastructure and manages reparations for communities historically displaced or harmed in **Infrastructure Reparations Zones** via a **Historical Harm Assessment Protocol**. Funds **Intergenerational Repair Programs** (e.g., retrofitting lead pipes, restoring strip-mined land) in partnership with the **Justice Systems Framework** (`framework_justice_reform`), with a percentage of generated value reinvested in local cooperative enterprises via the **Community Wealth Building** requirement.
* **Just Transition Service Corps (`institution_jtsc`)**: A branch of the **Community Work Teams** (`institution_cwt`) that retrains and employs former fossil fuel workers in decommissioning, grid modernization, and ecosystem restoration, with union-equivalent wages and benefits certified by the **Work in Liberation Framework** (`framework_work_liberation`). Partners with the **Mental Health Governance Framework** (`framework_mental_health`) to provide trauma-informed care for communities near decommissioning sites. Work is rewarded via the **AUBI** system.
* **Stranded Asset Compensation Protocol (`protocol_sacp`)**: Provides fair, time-bound compensation for asset holders transitioning infrastructure into Stewardship Trusts, with valuation based on regenerative potential and reparations for displaced communities.

### Pillar 3: The Infrastructure Commons Lifecycle

* **Infrastructure Planning & Permitting Process (`process_ippp`)**: A participatory process requiring **Intergenerational Impact Assessments** (`process_iia`), **Justice Impact Assessments** (evaluating impacts on marginalized communities), **FPIC 2.0** (`protocol_fpic2`), and a **Decolonial Design Review** co-led by local BAZs and the **Cultural Heritage Preservation Framework** (`framework_cultural_heritage`). Includes a **Traditional Technology Integration Protocol** to blend Indigenous and modern technologies. Climate-critical projects are fast-tracked via the **Climate Criticality Accelerator**. Annual community feedback forums, hosted by **Bioregional Grid Authorities**, ensure ongoing input, influencing **Regenerative Infrastructure Credits** (RICs) allocations.

* **Community Ownership Protocol**: Managed by the **Hearthstone Protocol**, enables **Bioregional Grid Authorities** to transfer 25% ownership stakes of new infrastructure to community-run cooperatives within 10 years of operation, with pathways to 51% ownership over 25 years, contingent on communities meeting GCF-funded stewardship capacity training requirements. Communities opting out of ownership responsibilities may designate a trusted BGA or cooperative to manage their stake.
* **Anti-Gentrification Protocol**: Integrated into the **Justice Impact Assessment**, models and mitigates potential displacement effects of new infrastructure, with authority to halt projects causing significant harm to existing communities.

### Pillar 4: Climate Criticality Accelerator

* **Climate Criticality Accelerator (`mechanism_cca`)**: A process where the **Planetary Health Council (`council_phc`)** identifies critical infrastructure needs for climate mitigation and adaptation (e.g., transnational renewable energy lines, flood-resistant water systems) and fast-tracks them through priority funding from the **Global Commons Fund (`mechanism_gcf`)** and streamlined approval via the **Infrastructure Planning & Permitting Process (`process_ippp`)**. Uses a Prioritization Matrix (30% climate vulnerability, 30% Indigenous co-design, 20% adaptation impact, 20% deployment speed). Includes a **Deliberative Urgency Protocol** streamlining deliberation timelines for high-scoring projects while upholding **FPIC 2.0** and justice protocols. All projects undergo a mandatory 5-year performance review by the **Planetary Health Council**, with authority to demote projects failing to meet regenerative and climate targets, revoking priority funding until realigned.
* **Climate Refugee Infrastructure Protocol**: Pre-plans adaptive infrastructure (e.g., modular housing, mobile water purification, resilient microgrids) for displacement hotspots (e.g., coastal cities, drought zones), co-designed with affected communities and the **Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience Framework** (`framework_drr`), prioritizing rapid deployment and cultural sensitivity.

## 5. Metrics & Evaluation
