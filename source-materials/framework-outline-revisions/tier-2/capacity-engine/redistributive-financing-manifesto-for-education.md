# **Redistributive Financing Manifesto for Regenerative Education**  
*A Call to Dismantle Extraction and Seed Collective Futures*  

---

## **Preamble: Education is a Commons, Not a Commodity**  
We reject the colonization of learning by profit. Today’s financial systems—where education is funded by those who demand returns—replicate the very inequalities they claim to solve. This manifesto proposes a radical alternative: **a global redistribution of wealth to fund education as a sacred, shared responsibility**.  

We draw inspiration from:  
- **The Zapatista Schools** of Chiapas, autonomously funded through communal labor.  
- **Iceland’s 0% Interest Public Bonds**, financing schools without enriching speculators.  
- **The Marshall Plan’s Principle**: Those who extract must repair.  

---

## **Core Principles**  

### **1. No Profit from Learning**  
- **Ban investor returns** exceeding inflation (capped at 1% if private capital is temporarily used).  
- **Abolish education debt**—no student or government loans with interest.  

### **2. Wealth Redistribution as Justice**  
- **Tax the 1%**: A 4% annual wealth tax on billionaires funds 80% of global education needs.  
- **Climate Reparations**: Redirect 10% of fossil fuel subsidies to Indigenous-led education.  
- **Cancel Illegitimate Debts**: Global South nations reallocate debt servicing to teachers’ salaries.  

### **3. Communities Govern All Funding**  
- **Participatory Budgeting**: Students, parents, and elders decide budgets via local assemblies.  
- **Veto Power**: Communities can reject funding tied to corporations, militarization, or austerity.  

### **4. Public Funding as the Default**  
- **Nationalize Education Banks**: State-owned banks lend at 0% interest for school infrastructure.  
- **Endowment Models**: 5% annual draw from a $500B global endowment (funded by wealth taxes).

## **Immediate Demands**  

### **For Governments**  
- Enact a **1% Robin Hood Tax** on financial transactions to generate $400B/year.  
- **Divest from Prisons/War**: Reallocate 25% of military budgets to free universities.  

### **For Corporations**  
- Mandate **10% profit-sharing** into community education trusts.  
- **Reparative Payments**: Tech giants fund digital literacy in regions they’ve exploited (e.g., Meta pays for Congo’s internet schools).  

### **For Philanthropy**  
- **No-Strings Grants**: Unrestricted funding prioritized for Black, Indigenous, and refugee-led initiatives.  
- **Sunset Clause**: Foundations must spend down 20%/year to disrupt wealth hoarding.  

### **For International Institutions**  
- **IMF/World Bank**: Cancel all education-related debt and issue **Solidarity Bonds** at 0% interest.  
- **UNESCO**: Create a **Global Reparations Fund** for colonial education harms.

## **Case Studies in Redistribution**  

### **1. Norway’s Sovereign Wealth Model**  
- Oil profits fund free higher education globally—proving **extractive wealth can repair**.  

### **2. Brazil’s Participatory Budgeting**  
- Porto Alegre’s schools improved literacy by 40% when **funding decisions were made by slum assemblies**.  

### **3. South Africa’s Wealth Tax**  
- A proposed 5% tax on the top 0.1% would **double free university budgets**.

## **A Call to Action**  

### **Phase 1: Disrupt**  
- **Divest** from banks funding for-profit education.  
- **Occupy** tax havens until they fund schools.  

### **Phase 2: Build**  
- **Cooperative Education Banks**: Lend at 0% interest via member-owned models.  
- **Local Endowments**: Seed with reclaimed wealth (e.g., seized oligarch assets).  

### **Phase 3: Scale**  
- **Global Wealth Tax Treaty**: Enforceable via trade sanctions on non-compliant nations.  
- **Pluriversal Funding Councils**: Indigenous, youth, and refugee leaders govern budgets.
