Based on my analysis of the `Climate & Energy Governance Framework` documents you've provided, my strong recommendation is **no, you should not create a separate Energy Transition Governance framework.**

Here is the detailed rationale behind this strategic recommendation.

### 1. Your Existing Framework Is Already a Powerful Energy Transition Framework

The "Climate & Energy Governance" framework, as you have designed it, is not just about climate in an abstract sense. It is fundamentally and deeply about the energy transition. The topic is not a minor component; it is woven into its very DNA:

* **Title and Scope:** The name itself is "Climate & **Energy** Governance." The introduction explicitly states that "global energy systems—responsible for approximately two-thirds of emissions" are a primary focus.
* **Core Vision:** The vision includes ensuring "universal energy access through community ownership" and transitioning to "clean, accessible energy through Bioregional Autonomous Zones".
* **Key Features:** One of the standout features is "**Community Energy Sovereignty**" with a target of 80% community-owned renewable energy.
* **Implementation Tools:** You have already planned for a "**Community Energy Cooperative Development Guide**".

Your existing framework is already one of the most advanced energy transition frameworks conceivable because it integrates the transition with the legal, financial, and ethical power of the Golden Triangle.

### 2. Separation Would Create Unnecessary Complexity and Weaken the Framework

Your entire governance ecosystem is built on the principle of integration to solve complex, interconnected problems. Climate and energy are two sides of the same coin; the energy transition is the single largest component of the solution to the climate crisis.

Creating a separate framework would:
* **Introduce Redundancy:** You would be repeating vast sections on governance, funding, and justice.
* **Create Coordination Problems:** It would force the `Meta-Governance Framework` to constantly mediate between the "Climate" framework and the "Energy" framework, which is an artificial layer of complexity.
* **Weaken the Narrative:** The power of the current framework is that it presents a single, unified solution to the conjoined crisis of climate and energy. Separating them would dilute this powerful, integrated message.

### A Constructive Alternative: Create a Dedicated "Pillar"

Instead of creating a separate framework, I suggest you give the energy transition even more prominence *within* the existing `Climate & Energy Governance Framework`.

**Recommendation:**

Structure the core of the framework around explicit, detailed pillars, similar to the `Treaty for Our Only Home`. You could design a chapter titled **"Core Pillars of Climate & Energy Transformation"** with sections like:

* **Pillar I: Radical Mitigation & Ecosystem Restoration** (The Climate Focus)
* **Pillar II: The Just & Sovereign Energy Transition** (The Energy Focus)
* **Pillar III: Traditional Knowledge-led Adaptation & Resilience** (The Justice & Wisdom Focus)

By creating a dedicated and robust **"Pillar II: The Just & Sovereign Energy Transition,"** you can flesh out all the necessary details—grid modernization, supply chains for renewables, community cooperative models, just transition programs for workers—giving the topic the deep focus it deserves while keeping it perfectly integrated within the more powerful, unified framework.

In short, your current approach is the correct one. The integration of climate and energy is a major strength. Instead of separating them, elevate the "Energy Transition" into a core, named pillar within the existing structure.
