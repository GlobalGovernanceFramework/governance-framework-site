# Framework Outline: Climate & Energy Governance

## 1. Introduction
   - **Purpose**: Define the need for a unified global approach to climate and energy governance, building on UNFCCC, Paris Agreement, and IPCC foundations.
   - **Scope**: Address climate change mitigation, adaptation, and sustainable energy transitions, emphasizing that global energy systems account for approximately two-thirds of emissions.
   - **Vision**: A resilient, equitable, and low-carbon global future with universal energy access through community ownership and clean, accessible energy via Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs).
   - **Key Definitions**:  
     - *Net-zero*: No net addition of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere.  
     - *Climate finance*: Funds for mitigation, adaptation, and loss/damage.  
     - *Clean energy*: Renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro, geothermal) plus nuclear, excluding fossil fuels even with CCS *unless independently verified to deliver net-negative outcomes at scale*.

## 2. Guiding Principles
   - **Sustainability**: Prioritize long-term ecological balance and resource preservation, integrating *circular economy principles* (e.g., reduce, reuse, recycle) aligned with biodiversity protection under the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.
   - **Equity**: Ensure fair distribution of responsibilities and benefits across nations, communities, and genders.  
     - **Sub-principle**: *Common but Differentiated Responsibilities (CBDR)*—developed nations lead emissions cuts based on historical responsibility, with policies addressing gendered climate impacts.
   - **Science-Based Decision Making**: Ground policies in IPCC research and UNFCCC mechanisms.
   - **Cooperation**: Foster international collaboration and accountability, leveraging Paris Agreement frameworks.
   - **Adaptability**: Build flexibility to respond to evolving challenges, technologies, and political shifts.
   - **Community Energy Sovereignty**: Promote 80% community-owned renewable energy systems to empower local stakeholders.
   - **Ethical Framework**:  
     - *Equity, reparations, intergenerational responsibility, and indigenous rights as ethical imperatives guiding all actions.*

## 3. Governance Structure
   - **Global Oversight Body**
     - Role: Coordinate policies, monitor progress, and enforce agreements; *integrates with UNFCCC processes and enhances Paris Agreement enforcement*.  
     - Enforcement Tools: Trade penalties, climate tariffs, and restricted access to green tech funds; *align trade measures with WTO exemptions (GATT Article XX)*.  
     - Dispute Resolution: *International Climate Tribunal*, starting as an advisory/soft-law body linked to UNFCCC arbitration, evolving as consensus builds.  
     - *Climate Emergency Clause*: Authority to invoke emergency powers (e.g., methane spikes, tipping points).  
     - *Safeguards*: Independent audits and rotating leadership to prevent capture by powerful interests.
   - **Regional Hubs**
     - Role: Tailor global goals to regional contexts (e.g., Africa, Asia-Pacific, Americas), coordinating with subnational actors (cities, regions).
     - Focus: Local capacity building, resource allocation, and resilience to political backsliding (e.g., multi-stakeholder coalitions).
   - **National Implementation Units**
     - Role: Execute policies and report progress, aligned with Paris Agreement Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs).
     - Emphasis: Sovereignty respected, with *fallback mechanisms* (e.g., regional oversight) during national political shifts.

## 4. Core Pillars of Climate & Energy Transformation
