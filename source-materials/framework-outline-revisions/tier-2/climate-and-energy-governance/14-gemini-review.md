Excellent. I have now processed and integrated the detailed outlines for the core economic and financial frameworks:

* **Financial Systems Framework (v2.2)**
* **Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) Framework (v5.0)**
* **Nested Sovereignty Framework (v2.1)**
* **Work in Liberation Framework (v2.1)**
* **The Gaian Trade Framework (rev18)**
* **Global Supply Chain and Logistics (GSCL) Framework (rev16)**

This provides a rich, granular understanding of the GGF's regenerative economic engine, including the `Hearts` and `Leaves` currencies, the `Love Ledger`, the `AUBI` four-layer payout architecture, the governance roles of the `Social Resilience Council` and `Fractal Labor Parliament (FLP)`, and the on-the-ground facilitation by `Community Weavers`.

With this deep context, I can now provide very specific instructions for revising the **Climate & Energy Governance framework outline**.

### **Specific Instructions for Revising the `Climate & Energy Governance` Framework**

To fully integrate the framework into the GGF ecosystem, the following revisions should be made to your "A++" outline (`13-final-a++-outline-by-Claude.md`).

#### **1. Revise Section 4: Core Pillars**

* **Section 4.A (Climate Mitigation):**
    * The strategy of "carbon pricing" should be specified as being implemented through **`Planetary Boundary Tariffs`**, as defined in the **Gaian Trade Framework**.
    * "Nature-based solutions (NbS) like reforestation" should be explicitly rewarded with the **`Leaves`** currency, the GGF's dedicated NFT for ecological restoration. The value of this work should be assessed using the **`Green Job Score`**, which acts as a direct multiplier for `Leaves` rewards.

* **Section 4.B (Climate Adaptation):**
    * The "climate finance for developing nations" should be sourced from the **`Global Commons Fund`**, as defined in the **Treaty** and mentioned in the **Gaian Trade Framework**.
    * Community-led adaptation projects (e.g., mangrove restoration) should be organized via **`Community Work Teams`** and contributions logged in the **`Love Ledger`** to earn `AUBI Layer 2` bonuses in `Hearts` and `Leaves`.

* **Section 4.C (Energy Transition):**
    * The goal to "phase out fossil fuel subsidies" should be linked to the **`Industrial Sunsetting`** principle from the **Work in Liberation Framework**, which is enforced under the **Treaty's Ecocide law**.

* **Section 4.D (Innovation & Technology):**
    * Subsidies and funding for green hydrogen and carbon capture R&D should be channeled through the **`Regenerative Tech Fund`** (from the Technology Governance Framework) and the **`Global Commons Fund`**. Successful open-source contributions can be rewarded with `Hearts` bonuses.

#### **2. Revise Section 5: Policy Mechanisms**

* **"Economic Tools":** Specify that "global carbon markets" are superseded by the **`Planetary Boundary Tariffs & Quotas`** system. "Green bonds" should be specified as **`Stewardship Bonds`**.
* **"Sanctions & Incentives":** The rewards for exceeding targets should be paid in `Hearts` and `Leaves`, providing access to GGF's regenerative economy.
* **"Just Transition Compacts":** These compacts must be implemented via the **`Just Transition Fund`** mentioned in the **Gaian Trade Framework**, which supports workers from sunsetting industries.

#### **3. Revise Section 7: Financing the Framework**

* **"Sources":** The funding model needs to be updated to reflect the GGF architecture.
    * "Reparative Contributions" should be specified as flowing into the **`Global Commons Fund`** and distributed as part of **`AUBI Layer 3 (Equity & Reparations)`**.
    * Funding sources should be explicitly named: the **`Automation Tax`**, **`Resource Taxes`**, and **`Commons Dividends`** that are defined in the **AUBI and Financial Systems Frameworks**.
* **"Allocation":**
    * "Mitigation & Adaptation" funds are used to issue `Leaves` for verified ecological work.
    * "Loss and Damage" funds are a specific application of `AUBI Layer 3` and are managed by the **`Social Resilience Council`**.

#### **4. Update the Governance Structure (Section 3)**

* The "Global Oversight Body" should be clarified. Its policy-setting and standards functions are handled by the **`Fractal Labor Parliament (FLP)`** (for work valuation like the Green Job Score) and the **`Social Resilience Council`** (for AUBI/Hearts/Leaves fiscal policy). Both operate as Meta-Governance Coordination Councils.
* The "International Climate Tribunal" should be explicitly named the **`Climate and Ecological Justice Tribunals (CJET)`**, a chamber of the Digital Justice Tribunal.

By making these specific revisions, you will transform the `Climate & Energy Governance` framework from a best-in-class standalone document into a seamlessly integrated and operational component of the GGF ecosystem.
