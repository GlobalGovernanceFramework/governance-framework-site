# The Hearthstone Protocol: A Framework for Commons & Stewardship - v1.5

**Framework ID:** `framework_property_stewardship`  
**Tier:** 2  
**Status:** Final Draft  
**Implementation Priority:** Critical  

## Vision

To provide the legal, ethical, and practical pathways for a just and orderly transition from a world based on private, extractive ownership to one grounded in shared, regenerative stewardship. This framework is the bridge that enables land, capital, and enterprise to be returned to the commons as sacred trusts governed for the well-being of all beings and future generations. It is the practical "how-to" for dismantling extractive structures and building a commonwealth rooted in relationship, responsibility, and justice. The term "rematriation" signifies a return to life-affirming, maternal principles of care, aligning with broader concepts like Land Back and cultural reclaiming.

## Stakeholder Benefits

| **Stakeholder**            | **Immediate Benefit**                        | **Long-Term Role**           |
|----------------------------|----------------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Indigenous Communities     | Land return, legal sovereignty via **BAZ**   | Governance & stewardship     |
| Corporations               | Transition incentives, legacy protection     | Regenerative partnership     |
| Nations                    | Trade preferences, currency support          | Eco-diplomacy leadership     |
| Citizens                   | Local governance, cultural reclamation       | Commons participation        |
| Youth                      | Fellowship, curriculum, veto power           | Generational equity          |

## Core Principles

1. **Primacy of the Commons:** The health of the planetary commons (ecological, cultural, digital) is the foundation of all economic and social activity. Private property rights are conditional and subordinate to stewardship responsibilities.
2. **Rightful Relationship & Rematriation:** Prioritizes returning assets—especially land—to their original stewards, particularly Indigenous communities (`institution_baz`), as an act of justice and ecological wisdom.
3. **Stewardship over Ownership:** Replaces absolute ownership with stewardship, where "rights" are tied to demonstrable care and regenerative impact, tracked via the **Love Ledger** (`platform_love_ledger`).
4. **Inalienable Rights of the Commons:** Certain assets (e.g., ecosystems, cultural heritage, sacred sites) are inalienable and may never be privatized or commodified, only stewarded.
5. **Just Transition & Non-Coercion:** The transition is voluntary and incentivized, ensuring social stability by offering asset-holders a respected role as stewards.
6. **Subsidiarity of Stewardship:** Stewardship is held at the most local level possible, starting with Bioregional Autonomous Zones (`institution_baz`) and Community Work Teams (`institution_cwt`).

## Systemic Integration

This framework acts as a central hub, translating high-level principles into tangible asset governance. The **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`) is governed by a tripartite board as defined in the **Treaty for Our Only Home** (`framework_treaty`), ensuring equitable resource allocation.

* **Depends On:**
  * **`framework_treaty`**: Provides constitutional authority (`institution_unga_reformed`) and enforcement (`institution_dj_tribunal`, `institution_getf`).
  * **`framework_indigenous`**: Provides ethical foundation, with **FPIC 2.0** (`protocol_fpic2`) and **Earth Council** (`council_earth`) veto power.
  * **`framework_justice`**: Provides restorative justice via **Truth and Reconciliation Processes** (`process_trc`).
  * **`framework_regenerative_enterprise`**: Incentivizes corporate transitions.
  * **`framework_financial_systems`**: Ensures economic stability, currency exchanges with **Tobin Tax**, and prevents capital flight.
  * **`framework_digital_commons`** and **`framework_aurora_accord`**: Govern intellectual property and data with **Proof of Care** validation (`process_proof_of_care`).
  * **`framework_technology_governance`**: Ensures AI and digital assets align with commons principles.
  * **`framework_education`**: Supports youth engagement and **Stewardship Law** certifications.
  * **`framework_urban_community`**: Supports urban asset transitions.
  * **`framework_gaian_trade`**: Facilitates trade agreements via **Gaian Trade Council** (`council_gaian_trade`).
  * **`framework_shield`**: Provides enforcement via **Global Enforcement Task Force** (`institution_getf`).
  * **`framework_meta_gov`**: Provides crisis response mechanisms (`process_crisis_command`).
  * **`framework_work_liberation`**: Provides roles like **Commons Scribes** for digital access.
* **Enables:**
  * **`institution_baz`**: Primary container for rematriated assets, governed by Indigenous systems.
  * **`framework_aubi`**: Backs **Hearts** (`mechanism_hearts`) and **Leaves** (`mechanism_leaves`) currencies.
  * **`framework_planetary_health`**: Enables ecosystem-wide management (`framework_eco_intel`).
  * **`framework_urban_community`**: Supports urban commons transitions.

## Core Components & Mechanisms

### Pillar 1: The Legal Architecture of Stewardship

This pillar creates legal tools and institutions for a post-private property world.

* **Stewardship Trust (`institution_stewardship_trust`)**: An internationally recognized legal entity replacing corporate or private title. Assets are governed for regenerative purposes by a **Stakeholder Council** (`council_stakeholder`) with mandatory Indigenous and youth representation (via **Global Youth Assembly**, `institution_gya`) and a "Sunset Clause" requiring re-election every 3 years via **Love Ledger** accountability metrics. Governance models are selected from the **Commons Governance Pattern Library**, with risk ratings tracked on **platform_commons_registry**. Small businesses/worker cooperatives and multinationals follow differentiated transition pathways, with multinationals subject to stricter **International Commons Court** oversight.
* **Bio-Cultural Stewardship Trust (`institution_biocultural_stewardship_trust`)**: A subtype for assets where ecology and culture are inseparable, mandating co-governance by **Planetary Health Council** (`council_phc`) and **Earth Council** (`council_earth`).
* **Sacred Trust Designation Process (`protocol_sacred_trust`)**: Led by **Earth Council**, designates assets as "sacred" based on community petitions (minimum 100 signatories or 10% of local population, whichever is greater) and **Earth Council** ratification, ensuring spiritual, ecological, or cultural significance, with a **Spiritual Recognition Clause** allowing community-proposed spiritual significance.
* **Rematriation Legal Protocol (`protocol_rematriation_legal`)**: Overseen by **International Commons Court** (`institution_icc`) within **Digital Justice Tribunal** (`institution_dj_tribunal`), transfers land to **BAZ** stewardship with historical claim validation, ecological covenants, and an **Inalienable Sanctity Clause**. Enforcement in non-participating nations follows a tiered response:
  * **Tier 1 (Soft):** Negotiation/mediation by **Office of Commons Transition**.
  * **Tier 2 (Medium):** Trade denial/tariffs by **Gaian Trade Council** (`council_gaian_trade`).
  * **Tier 3 (Hard):** ICC indictments and arrest warrants via **institution_getf**, with a 12-month **Grace Period** for compliance.
* **Commons Title Registry (`platform_commons_registry`)**: A blockchain-based registry for stewarded assets, integrated with **Love Ledger**, audited by **Office of the Adversary** (`institution_adversary`). Tracks risk ratings, triggering **Stewardship Escalation Pathway** if **BHI**/**LMCI** fall below thresholds. Metrics validated via **Proof of Care** (`process_proof_of_care`) requiring multi-stakeholder approval (BAZ council, peer, AI monitor). Supports hybrid participation via **Commons Scribes** and paper-based records digitized at **BAZ** centers.
* **Office of Commons Transition (`institution_commons_transition_office`)**: Within **Global Justice Oversight Body** (`institution_gjo`), provides legal, mediation, and technical support. Operates regional hubs for cultural adaptation of transition protocols. Includes:
  * **Economic Stability Modeling Wing**: Models transition impacts, develops **Commons Conversion Bonds** for pension funds and investors, with **GCF** risk guarantees.
  * **Land Back and Reparations Liaison** (`initiative_landback_reparations_liaison`): Coordinates with global movements.
  * **Stewardship Ombudsman** (`role_stewardship_ombudsman`): Handles grievances from marginalized groups.
* **Protocol for Intangible Commons Stewardship (`protocol_intangible_commons_stewardship`)**: Governs cultural heritage, intellectual property, and data, aligned with **framework_digital_commons**, **framework_aurora_accord**, and **framework_technology_governance**. AI assets must serve the commons under **council_turing** oversight.
* **Commons Governance Pattern Library (`tool_commons_pattern_library`)**: Open-source governance templates curated by **Office of Commons Transition**, co-created with local **BAZs** and cultural leaders for regional adaptation. Includes:
  * *Worker-Community Council Pattern*: For manufacturing enterprises and worker cooperatives.
  * *Ecosystem Guardian Pattern*: For natural assets with non-human rights roles.
  * *Digital Commons Contributor Pattern*: For open-source software/data, tied to **framework_digital_commons**.
* **Bioregional Readiness Assessment (`tool_bioregional_readiness_index`)**: Measures **BAZ** governance maturity, community buy-in, and ecological importance to prioritize transitions.
* **International Commons Court (`institution_icc`)**: A specialized chamber within **Digital Justice Tribunal** for cross-border commons disputes and enforcement.

### Pillar 2: Pathways for Asset Transition

This pillar provides voluntary, incentivized processes for transitioning assets.

  * **Annotation [24-review-gemini.md, Day in the Life Scenarios]:** Develop a narrative scenario illustrating a multinational boardroom discussion on initiating **process_corporate_conversion**, highlighting pressures (e.g., reputational risks, regulatory scrutiny) and incentives (e.g., tax breaks, **Hearts** issuance, legacy protection) to make the process tangible.
* **Land Rematriation Initiative (`initiative_land_rematriation`)**: Funded by **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`), purchases ecologically/culturally significant land (prioritizing sacred sites) for **BAZ** stewardship, with **institution_getf** protection if threatened.  
  * **Annotation [24-review-gemini.md, Day in the Life Scenarios]:** Create a narrative scenario depicting a **BAZ** council member using the **Bioregional Readiness Assessment** to evaluate a rematriation proposal, showing decision-making and community engagement.
* **Stewardship Inheritance Protocol (`protocol_stewardship_inheritance`)**: Allows bequeathing assets to Stewardship Trusts with tax and social benefits (e.g., **Hearts** issuance), supported by intergenerational dialogue via **Stewardship Mentorship Program**.
* **Capital Commons Transition (`process_capital_transition`)**: Transitions financial capital into **Regenerative Financial System** vehicles, with tax breaks and **Transitional Trade Agreements** to prevent capital flight.
* **Corporate Reparations Protocol (`protocol_corporate_reparations`)**: Requires extractive corporations to fund transitions via **Reparations Levy** (`metric_reparations_index`), scaled by harm history (e.g., 5% for extractive industries, 1% for B-corps), including intellectual property and data.
* **Debt-for-Stewardship Swap (`mechanism_debt_stewardship_swap`)**: Allows indebted landowners to transfer assets to trusts for debt relief.
* **Stewardship Mentorship Program (`initiative_stewardship_mentorship`)**: Pairs asset-holders with stewards (e.g., Indigenous elders, B-corp leaders, youth from **Youth Stewardship Fellowship**), offering grief counseling and intergenerational dialogue via **framework_mental_health**.

* **Emergency Stewardship Protocol (`protocol_emergency_stewardship`)**: Triggered by **process_crisis_command** (`framework_meta_gov`), places endangered commons into temporary receivership by **Office of Commons Transition** with democratic oversight.
* **No-Fault Commons Support Protocol (`protocol_no_fault_support`)**: Provides priority access to **Emergency Stewardship Protocol** and **GCF** resilience funding for Stewardship Trusts harmed by external factors (e.g., climate disasters, cross-border pollution), distinguishing unavoidable harm from mismanagement.  
  * **Annotation [24-review-gemini.md, Failure and Healing Protocols]:** Draft narrative scenario of a Stewardship Trust affected by a climate disaster, detailing how **protocol_no_fault_support** provides funding and support without penalizing the Trust.
* **Transitional Trade Agreement (`protocol_transitional_trade_agreement`)**: Developed with **framework_gaian_trade**, offers preferential tariffs for nations meeting **BHI** benchmarks, enforced by **Gaian Trade Council** (`council_gaian_trade`).
* **Commons Dissolution Protocol (`protocol_commons_dissolution`)**: Guides fair reversion of stewarded assets to regional legal status if a **BAZ** democratically exits the GGF system, ensuring conflict-free disengagement.

### Pillar 3: Economic & Cultural Integration

This pillar ensures economic viability and cultural support.

* **Stewardship-Linked Valuation (`mechanism_slv`)**: Ties asset value to regenerative performance (**BHI** for ecological health, **LMCI** for social health, climate adaptation metrics), with a "transition buffer" setting initial **BHI** targets 10% below regional baselines, rising 2% annually, tracked on **Love Ledger** with **Proof of Care** validation.
* **Commons Dividend Protocol (`protocol_commons_dividend`)**: Distributes surplus (40% reinvested, 30% to stewards as **Hearts** for **LMCI**, **Leaves** for **BHI**, 30% to **GCF**), prioritizing **BAZ** community benefits. **Hearts/Leaves** are convertible to national currencies via regulated bioregional exchanges managed by **framework_financial_systems**, using a crawling peg system tied to **BHI**/**LMCI** to ensure local parity, with a **Tobin Tax** (0.1% per transaction) to deter speculation, adjusted quarterly.
* **"Story of Stewardship" Initiative (`initiative_stewardship_story`)**: Run through **Public Epistemic Institutions** (`institution_epi_institution`), shifts narratives to "wealth as regenerative capacity." Includes:

  * **Visual Companion Series** (`initiative_visual_companion`): Developed with **Transdisciplinary Foresight Labs**, includes diagrams and flowcharts for:
    * Transition steps (land → stewardship trust → local governance).
    * Enforcement pathways (non-compliance → negotiation → trade denial → ICC/**GETF**).
    * **Commons Dividend** and **SLV** mechanics.
  * **Intergenerational Dialogue Program** (`initiative_intergenerational_dialogue`): Facilitates elder-youth collaboration on property norm transitions, integrated with **Stewardship Mentorship Program**.

    * **Annotation [24-review-gemini.md, Commons Transition Starter Kit]:** Draft the 1-page plain-language summary and bundle with existing components for dissemination.
* **Stewardship Escalation Pathway (`protocol_stewardship_escalation`)**: Addresses mismanagement:
  1. Community feedback on **Love Ledger**.
  2. Local **Stakeholder Council** resolution.
  3. Escalation to **Office of Commons Transition**.
  4. **International Commons Court** review, with potential stewardship revocation if **BHI**/**LMCI** fall below thresholds.
* **Stewardship Receivership Protocol (`protocol_stewardship_receivership`)**: **Office of Commons Transition** stabilizes failed trusts, installing new stewards with local **BAZ**. Trusts designate backup stewards (e.g., neighboring BAZ).
* **Youth Stewardship Fellowship (`initiative_youth_stewardship_fellowship`)**: Managed by **Global Youth Assembly** (`institution_gya`), places youth in **Stewardship Trust** bodies with veto power over intergenerational equity decisions (e.g., asset liquidation, ecological thresholds), subject to **Stakeholder Council** override with 75% majority.
* **Commons Curriculum (`initiative_commons_curriculum`)**: Developed with **framework_education**, educates youth on stewardship principles and includes **Stewardship Law** certifications for lawyers/judges.
* **Commons Game/Simulation (`initiative_commons_simulation`)**: An educational tool by **Transdisciplinary Foresight Labs** to test stakeholder roles.
