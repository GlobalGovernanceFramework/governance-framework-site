# Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health Governance

## Executive Summary
The **Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health** is a transformative, rights-based framework prioritizing psychosocial flourishing, equity, and planetary well-being. Key priorities include:
- **Quick Wins:** Integrate mental health into Universal Health Coverage (UHC), train primary care workers in mental health first aid, establish community-led task forces.
- **Long-Term Shifts:** Transition to rights-based care, create a Global Mental Health Commons Fund, embed mental health in climate and future-of-work policies.
- **Monitoring & Accountability:** Use flourishing metrics (e.g., social connectedness, self-efficacy) and a Global Mental Health Watchdog with a Traffic Light System for compliance.

## Quick Start Guide
1. **Integrate Mental Health into UHC:** Mandate ≥5% of national health budgets for mental health, enforced via trade incentives.
2. **Launch Community-Led Task Forces:** Pilot decentralized governance with digital cooperatives in 5 diverse regions.
3. **Establish Watchdog with Traffic Light System:** Rank countries (🟩 Green = compliant, 🟨 Yellow = partial, 🟥 Red = sanctions) based on mental health investment and rights-based care.

## Principles in Practice Sidebar
- **Case Example 1 (Kenya):** Community-led task forces integrated traditional healers into MHPSS, reducing stigma by 30% in rural areas.
- **Case Example 2 (Netherlands):** Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Lab piloted under academic oversight, improving depression outcomes by 25%.
- **Case Example 3 (New Zealand):** Rights-based care transition eliminated involuntary hospitalizations, boosting patient trust.
