## **Plain Language Summary**
Water and sanitation are essential for life, health, and dignity. This framework ensures universal access to clean water and safe sanitation by treating water as a sacred, shared resource, not a commodity. It integrates Indigenous wisdom, community leadership, and innovative financing to build resilient, equitable systems. Practical tools like the **BAZ & Community WASH Starter Kit** and ethical financing safeguards make it actionable. See **Appendix B: Regional Implementation Blueprints** for tailored strategies across diverse contexts (e.g., urban, flood-prone, conflict zones).

---

## **Theory of Change**
Water and sanitation challenges stem from systemic inequities, environmental degradation, and governance failures. By embedding human rights, blue democracy, and regenerative principles within the GGF ecosystem, this framework transforms WASH through inclusive policies, innovative financing, and biomimetic technologies. Multi-level institutions, empowered communities, and conscious leadership drive equitable access, climate resilience, and ecosystem restoration, achieving SDG 6 and fostering planetary justice across geological time scales.

---

## **Framework Position within the Golden Triangle**
The **Global Framework for WASH Governance** is empowered by the **Treaty for Our Only Home** through enforceable mechanisms like the **Digital Justice Tribunal** (Pillar 3) for hydrological justice and the **Global Equity Ombudsperson** (Pillar 2) for grievances. It is guided by the **Indigenous Framework**, embedding **Rights of Nature** principles and **Earth Council (Kawsay Pacha)** oversight for sacred ecosystems. The **Meta-Governance Framework** coordinates implementation via a **Global Water & Sanitation Council**, aligning with the **Planetary Health Council**, **Work in Liberation Framework**, **AUBI**, **Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health**, and **Synoptic Protocol**. WASH metrics feed into the **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)** and **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**. The **Aurora Accord** ensures data sovereignty, protecting Indigenous knowledge.
