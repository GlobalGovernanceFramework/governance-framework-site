That's an excellent question that goes to the heart of how these interconnected frameworks should operate. You are right to identify that fishing is a complex, cross-cutting issue.

Here is my assessment of how the `Animal Welfare` framework currently handles fishing and my recommendation for the path forward.

### Current Status in the Framework

Your observation is correct. The framework *does* address fish, but its coverage of **wild-capture fishing** is still light.

* **What is covered:**
    * Fish are placed in **Tier 3** of the Protection System, which mandates "stress-free transport" and ethical slaughter methods. This is well-suited for aquaculture (fish farming).
    * The principle of **Ecological Necessity** and the protections for **Subsistence Hunting** would apply to subsistence fishing practices by Indigenous and local communities.
    * The framework's commitment to sentience research explicitly includes "fish pain cognition".

* **What is missing:** The framework currently lacks detailed policies that address the primary welfare issues of large-scale, industrial fishing, such as bycatch, the suffering caused by different types of nets and lines, and long-term ecosystem impacts.

### The Solution: Shared Governance with the Oceans Framework

Your intuition is exactly right. Trying to solve all aspects of fishing within the `Animal Welfare` framework alone would make it overly complex and would duplicate the work of the future `Oceans and Marine Governance` framework.

The correct architectural solution is a **shared governance model**. Each framework has a distinct but complementary responsibility.

* **The `Animal Welfare` Framework's Role (The "How"):** This framework is responsible for the **individual suffering and sentience** of the animals.
    * It sets the ethical standards for **humane slaughter** on fishing vessels.
    * It regulates or bans specific equipment based on the **cruelty** it inflicts (e.g., long-line fishing methods, types of nets that cause slow suffocation).
    * Its Tiered Protection System determines the level of protection for different marine species (e.g., fish vs. octopuses vs. cetaceans).

* **The `Oceans and Marine Governance` Framework's Role (The "How Many" and "Where"):** This framework is responsible for **ecological health and population sustainability.**
    * It sets **fishing quotas** to prevent overfishing.
    * It establishes **Marine Protected Areas (MPAs)** where fishing is banned.
    * It regulates methods based on their **ecological destructiveness** (e.g., bottom trawling).
    * It sets **bycatch limits** to protect non-target species.

**In Practice:** A policy on tuna fishing would be co-governed. The `Oceans` framework would set the quota (how many tuna can be caught), while the `Animal Welfare` framework would regulate the method (mandating specific hook types to reduce suffering and requiring humane slaughter methods on the boat).

### Recommendation: Add an Explicit Integration Clause

To make this clear, I recommend adding a new sub-section to the `Animal Welfare` framework that explicitly defines this shared governance model.

**Proposed Snippet for the `Animal Welfare` Framework (e.g., in Section 7):**

> ### **Integration with Marine Governance: The Case of Fishing**
>
> The governance of wild-capture fishing represents a key area of synergy between the Animal Welfare framework and the `Oceans and Marine Governance` framework. To ensure a holistic approach, governance is shared:
>
> * The **`Oceans and Marine Governance` Framework** is responsible for ecological sustainability, including setting fishing quotas, bycatch limits, and establishing Marine Protected Areas.
> * This **`Animal Welfare` Framework** is responsible for the individual well-being of marine animals. It sets the standards for humane capture and slaughter methods and bans equipment based on the suffering it causes to both target and non-target species.
>
> All policies related to fishing are co-reviewed by both the Animal Welfare Council and the future Oceans and Marine Governance Council to ensure a cohesive and ethical approach.

This addition clarifies the scope of this framework and demonstrates its sophisticated, integrated design, reassuring the reader that the issue is being handled comprehensively within the broader GGF ecosystem.
