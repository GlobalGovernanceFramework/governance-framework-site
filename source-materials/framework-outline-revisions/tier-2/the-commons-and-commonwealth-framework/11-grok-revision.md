# The Commons & Commonwealth Framework: A Property & Stewardship Transition Protocol - v1.0

**Framework ID:** `framework_property_stewardship`  
**Tier:** 2  
**Status:** Final Draft  
**Implementation Priority:** Critical  

## Vision

To provide the legal, ethical, and practical pathways for a just and orderly transition from a world based on private, extractive ownership to one grounded in shared, regenerative stewardship. This framework is the bridge that enables land, capital, and enterprise to be returned to the commons as sacred trusts governed for the well-being of all beings and future generations. It is the practical "how-to" for dismantling extractive structures and building a commonwealth rooted in relationship, responsibility, and justice. The term "rematriation" signifies a return to life-affirming, maternal principles of care, aligning with broader concepts like Land Back and cultural reclaiming.

## Core Principles

1. **Primacy of the Commons:** The health of the planetary commons (ecological, cultural, digital) is the foundation of all economic and social activity. Private property rights are conditional and subordinate to the responsibility of stewardship.
2. **Rightful Relationship & Rematriation:** Prioritizes returning assets—especially land—to their original stewards, particularly Indigenous communities (`institution_baz`), as an act of justice and ecological wisdom.
3. **Stewardship over Ownership:** Replaces absolute ownership with stewardship, where "rights" are tied to demonstrable care and regenerative impact, tracked via the **Love Ledger** (`platform_love_ledger`).
4. **Inalienable Rights of the Commons:** Certain assets (e.g., ecosystems, cultural heritage, sacred sites) are inalienable and may never be privatized or commodified, only stewarded.
5. **Just Transition & Non-Coercion:** The transition is voluntary and incentivized, ensuring social stability by offering asset-holders a respected role as stewards.
6. **Subsidiarity of Stewardship:** Stewardship is held at the most local level possible, starting with Bioregional Autonomous Zones (`institution_baz`) and Community Work Teams (`institution_cwt`).

## Systemic Integration

This framework acts as a central hub, translating high-level principles into tangible asset governance. The **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`) is governed by a tripartite board as defined in the **Treaty for Our Only Home** (`framework_treaty`), ensuring equitable resource allocation.

* **Depends On:**
  * **`framework_treaty`**: Provides constitutional authority (`institution_unga_reformed`) and enforcement (`institution_dj_tribunal`).
  * **`framework_indigenous`**: Provides ethical foundation, with **FPIC 2.0** (`protocol_fpic2`) and **Earth Council** (`council_earth`) veto power.
  * **`framework_justice`**: Provides restorative justice via **Truth and Reconciliation Processes** (`process_trc`).
  * **`framework_regenerative_enterprise`**: Incentivizes corporate transitions.
  * **`framework_financial_systems`**: Ensures economic stability and prevents capital flight.
  * **`framework_digital_commons`** and **`framework_aurora_accord`**: Govern intellectual property and data.
  * **`framework_technology_governance`**: Ensures AI and digital assets align with commons principles.
  * **`framework_education`**: Supports youth engagement and curriculum development.
* **Enables:**
  * **`institution_baz`**: Primary container for rematriated assets, governed by Indigenous systems.
  * **`framework_aubi`**: Backs **Hearts** (`mechanism_hearts`) and **Leaves** (`mechanism_leaves`) currencies.
  * **`framework_planetary_health`**: Enables ecosystem-wide management (`framework_eco_intel`).
  * **`framework_urban_community`**: Supports urban asset transitions.

## Core Components & Mechanisms

### Pillar 1: The Legal Architecture of Stewardship

This pillar creates legal tools and institutions for a post-private property world.

* **Stewardship Trust (`institution_stewardship_trust`)**: An internationally recognized legal entity replacing corporate or private title. Assets are governed for regenerative purposes by a **Stakeholder Council** (`council_stakeholder`) with Indigenous representation and a "Sunset Clause" requiring re-election every 3 years via **Love Ledger** accountability metrics. Governance models are selected from the **Commons Governance Pattern Library**, with risk ratings tracked on **platform_commons_registry**.
* **Bio-Cultural Stewardship Trust (`institution_biocultural_stewardship_trust`)**: A subtype for assets where ecology and culture are inseparable, mandating co-governance by **Planetary Health Council** (`council_phc`) and **Earth Council** (`council_earth`).
* **Sacred Trust Designation Process (`protocol_sacred_trust`)**: Led by **Earth Council**, designates assets as "sacred" based on spiritual, ecological, or cultural significance, with a **Spiritual Recognition Clause** allowing community-proposed spiritual significance.
* **Rematriation Legal Protocol (`protocol_rematriation_legal`)**: Overseen by **Digital Justice Tribunal** (`institution_dj_tribunal`), transfers land to **BAZ** stewardship with historical claim validation, ecological covenants, and an **Inalienable Sanctity Clause**. Enforcement in non-participating nations uses **framework_gaian_trade** and **framework_financial_systems** incentives.
* **Commons Title Registry (`platform_commons_registry`)**: A blockchain-based registry for stewarded assets, integrated with **Love Ledger**, audited by **Office of the Adversary** (`institution_adversary`).
* **Office of Commons Transition (`institution_commons_transition_office`)**: Within **Global Justice Oversight Body** (`institution_gjo`), provides legal, mediation, and technical support. Includes:
  * **Economic Stability Modeling Wing**: Models transition impacts.
  * **Land Back and Reparations Liaison** (`initiative_landback_reparations_liaison`): Coordinates with global movements.
  * **Stewardship Ombudsman** (`role_stewardship_ombudsman`): Handles grievances from marginalized groups.
* **Protocol for Intangible Commons Stewardship (`protocol_intangible_commons_stewardship`)**: Governs cultural heritage, intellectual property, and data, aligned with **framework_digital_commons**, **framework_aurora_accord**, and **framework_technology_governance**. AI assets must serve the commons under **council_turing** oversight.
* **Commons Governance Pattern Library (`tool_commons_pattern_library`)**: Open-source governance templates curated by **Office of Commons Transition**, including:
  * *Worker-Community Council Pattern*: For manufacturing enterprises.
  * *Ecosystem Guardian Pattern*: For natural assets with non-human rights roles.
  * *Digital Commons Contributor Pattern*: For open-source software/data.

### Pillar 2: Pathways for Asset Transition

This pillar provides voluntary, incentivized processes for transitioning assets.

* **Corporate Co-op Conversion Process (`process_corporate_conversion`)**: Transitions certified enterprises into Stewardship Trusts or cooperatives.
* **Land Rematriation Initiative (`initiative_land_rematriation`)**: Funded by **Global Commons Fund** (`mechanism_gcf`), purchases ecologically/culturally significant land for **BAZ** stewardship, prioritizing community benefits.
* **Stewardship Inheritance Protocol (`protocol_stewardship_inheritance`)**: Allows bequeathing assets to Stewardship Trusts with tax and social benefits (e.g., **Hearts** issuance).
* **Capital Commons Transition (`process_capital_transition`)**: Transitions financial capital into **Regenerative Financial System** vehicles, with tax breaks to prevent capital flight.
* **Corporate Reparations Protocol (`protocol_corporate_reparations`)**: Requires extractive corporations to fund transitions via **Reparations Levy** (`metric_reparations_index`), including intellectual property and data.
* **Debt-for-Stewardship Swap (`mechanism_debt_stewardship_swap`)**: Allows indebted landowners to transfer assets to trusts for debt relief.
* **Stewardship Mentorship Program (`initiative_stewardship_mentorship`)**: Pairs asset-holders with stewards (e.g., Indigenous elders, B-corp leaders), offering grief counseling via **framework_mental_health**.
* **Urban Commons Transition Protocol (`protocol_urban_commons_transition`)**: Developed with **framework_urban_community**, transitions urban assets (e.g., public housing, community gardens) into stewardship models.
* **Commons Sandbox Zones (`initiative_commons_sandbox`)**: Temporary test zones for piloting stewardship models before full transition, coordinated with **framework_urban_community**.

### Pillar 3: Economic & Cultural Integration

This pillar ensures economic viability and cultural support.

* **Stewardship-Linked Valuation (`mechanism_slv`)**: Ties asset value to regenerative performance (**BHI** for ecological health, **LMCI** for social health, climate adaptation metrics), tracked on **Love Ledger**.
* **Commons Dividend Protocol (`protocol_commons_dividend`)**: Distributes surplus (40% reinvested, 30% to stewards as **Hearts** for **LMCI**, **Leaves** for **BHI**, 30% to **GCF**), prioritizing **BAZ** community benefits.
* **"Story of Stewardship" Initiative (`initiative_stewardship_story`)**: Run through **Public Epistemic Institutions** (`institution_epi_institution`), shifts narratives to "wealth as regenerative capacity." Includes:
  * **Counter-Disinformation Wing**: Debunks myths (e.g., "commons as communism").
  * **Stewardship Art Residency** (`initiative_stewardship_art_residency`): Documents transitions through art.
  * **Ego-to-Eco Storytelling Grant** (`initiative_ego_to_eco_grant`): Funds personal transition narratives.
  * **Path of the Pioneer Steward** (`initiative_pioneer_steward`): Case studies showcasing economic, social, and cultural benefits (e.g., tax relief, honorifics) for early adopters.
* **Stewardship Escalation Pathway (`protocol_stewardship_escalation`)**: Addresses mismanagement:
  1. Community feedback on **Love Ledger**.
  2. Local **Stakeholder Council** resolution.
  3. Escalation to **Office of Commons Transition**.
  4. **Digital Justice Tribunal** review, with potential stewardship revocation if **BHI**/**LMCI** fall below thresholds.
* **Stewardship Receivership Protocol (`protocol_stewardship_receivership`)**: **Office of Commons Transition** stabilizes failed trusts, installing new stewards with local **BAZ**. Trusts designate backup stewards (e.g., neighboring BAZ).
* **Youth Stewardship Fellowship (`initiative_youth_stewardship_fellowship`)**: Managed by **Global Youth Assembly** (`institution_gya`), places youth in **Stewardship Trust** bodies for hands-on experience.
* **Commons Curriculum (`initiative_commons_curriculum`)**: Developed with **framework_education**, educates youth on stewardship principles.
* **Commons Game/Simulation (`initiative_commons_simulation`)**: An educational tool by **Transdisciplinary Foresight Labs** to test stakeholder roles.
