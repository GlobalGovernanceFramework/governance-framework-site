## **Plain Language Summary**
Healthy soil is not just dirt—it’s a living, breathing system that feeds life, from microscopic organisms to global ecosystems. This framework helps the world shift from taking from the land to giving back—so all people, plants, animals, and microbes can thrive together. It connects soil health to markets, peace, mental well-being, and future generations, ensuring regenerative practices, including microbial stewardship, are rewarded, protected, and actionable through clear governance and practical tools.

---

## **Vision: Land as Relation, Not Commodity**
To reframe humanity’s relationship with land and soil, shifting from an extractive, property-based model to a regenerative, stewardship-based model where soil is treated as a living, sacred commons essential for all life. Regeneration is a civilizational duty of repair and reciprocity, arising from centuries of extraction and loss. This framework respects soil-based spiritualities, animist traditions, and microbial ecosystems, fostering economic, social, and psychological benefits through integration with global governance systems, supported by clear governance hierarchies and actionable community tools.

---

## **Framework Position within the Golden Triangle**
The **Soil Health & Land Use Governance Framework** is empowered by the **Treaty** through enforceable mechanisms such as bans on soil-degrading chemicals, the **Land Rematriation Tribunal** under Pillar 3, and trade sanctions for non-compliance. It is guided by the **Indigenous Framework**, embedding Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) as the foundation for regenerative agriculture, soil health practices, and microbial stewardship. The **Meta-Governance Framework** coordinates alignment across Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), resolving conflicts and ensuring consistency with global sustainability goals, including the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), climate targets, the **Biodiversity Framework**, **Planetary Health Framework**, **Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health**, and **Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) Framework**. The **Aurora Accord** ensures data sovereignty, while the **Gaian Trade Framework** integrates soil health into trade via **Digital Product Passports**. The **Synoptic Protocol** and **Global Indigenous Media Network (GIMN)** amplify soil-healing narratives. The **Treaty’s Council of Guardians** ensures intergenerational accountability.

---

## **Core Principles**
1. **Soil as a Living Commons**: Soil is a shared, living entity with a right to be healthy, aligned with **Rights of Nature** legal frameworks (e.g., Ecuador, New Zealand).
2. **Subsoil Rights**: Protects deep soil layers from extractive industries (e.g., mining, fracking).
3. **Bioregional Governance**: Land use decisions at the watershed/ecosystem level through BAZs, meeting a **Minimum Regenerative Threshold**.
4. **Land Rematriation & Restorative Justice**: Prioritizes Indigenous stewardship, cultural healing, and reparations, addressing colonial legacies and non-Indigenous landless populations.
5. **Regenerative by Default**: Mandates practices that improve soil health, water cycles, and biodiversity (e.g., soil cover, minimal disturbance, living roots, species diversity, livestock integration, limited synthetics).
6. **Food & Water Sovereignty**: Ensures community control over food and water, integrating urban-rural linkages (e.g., urban agriculture, rooftop gardens).
7. **Intergenerational Equity & Temporal Justice**: Includes youth delegations in **Bioregional Land Councils** with veto power and **future-being impact reports** reviewed by **Treaty’s Council of Guardians**.
8. **Post-Ownership Stewardship**: Evolves land stewardship beyond ownership toward shared responsibility, supported by legal frameworks.
9. **Soil-Human Health Reciprocity**: Links healthy soils to nutrient-dense food and human health, integrated with **Planetary Health Framework** and **Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health**.
10. **Microbial Sovereignty & Commons**: The genetic heritage of soil microbiomes is a shared commons, not a patentable commodity, ensuring open access for regenerative purposes and protection from privatization.
