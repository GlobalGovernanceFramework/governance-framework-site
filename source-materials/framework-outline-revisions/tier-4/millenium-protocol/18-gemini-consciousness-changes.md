### **Proposed Changes to the Millennium Protocol Outline**

To reflect these schema changes and strengthen the outline, I recommend the following revisions.

#### **1. Clarify the Authority of The Interstellar Commission**

**Rationale:** The phrase "evolving from" is ambiguous. A constitutional charter requires precision about authority. This change establishes a clear and logical hierarchy.

  * **Location:** Pillar I: Deep Time Governance Architecture \> The Interstellar Commission
  * **Current Text:** "A high-level council, evolving from the **Global Technology Council (`council_gtc`)** and **Planetary Health Council (`council_phc`)**, tasked with multi-century strategic planning and protocol oversight."
  * **Proposed Revision:** "A supreme **Tier 4** council responsible for multi-century strategic planning and protocol oversight. On matters of interstellar or millennial significance, the **Global Technology Council (`council_gtc`)** and the **Planetary Health Council (`council_phc`)** operate under the guidance of and report to the Commission, ensuring a unified long-term vision."

#### **2. Integrate the Cosmic Artisan Guilds with Existing GGF Structures**

**Rationale:** This change grounds the visionary concept of "Artisan Guilds" in the established, practical structure of the `Work in Liberation Framework`, making it more implementable and integrated.

  * **Location:** Pillar V: Cosmic Wisdom & Purpose \> Cosmic Aesthetics & Culture \> Beauty Mandate
  * **Current Text:** "...evaluated through **Aesthetic Impact Assessments (AIAs)** scored by **Cosmic Artisan Guilds**."
  * **Proposed Revision:** "...evaluated through **Aesthetic Impact Assessments (AIAs)** scored by **Cosmic Artisan Guilds**. These Guilds are a specialized and highly-trained evolution of **Community Work Teams (`institution_cwt`)**, representing the pinnacle of 'Work With Purpose' applied to cosmic-scale creativity and harmony."

#### **3. Create an Economic Incentive for Cosmic Beauty via AUBI**

**Rationale:** This change connects the "Beauty Mandate" directly to the GGF's core economic engine, the `AUBI Framework`. It creates a powerful, positive feedback loop, making cosmic beauty a valued and rewarded contribution to the regenerative economy.

  * **Location:** Pillar V: Cosmic Wisdom & Purpose \> Cosmic Aesthetics & Culture \> Beauty Mandate
  * **Suggested Addition (add as a new sentence):** "Projects receiving high scores on their AIAs are recognized as significant contributions to planetary and cosmic flourishing. This achievement is logged on the **Love Ledger (`platform_love_ledger`)** and rewarded with a substantial issuance of **Leaves (`mechanism_leaves`)** to the originating community, creating a direct economic incentive for beautiful and harmonious design."
