Yes, absolutely. Based on my analysis of your existing frameworks like the `Integrated Meta-Governance` and `Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge` documents, I strongly recommend drafting the WDIP in full, using the same comprehensive, multi-section format.

Hereâ€™s why that approach is the right one for this stage:

1.  **Consistency and Coherence:** Your ecosystem of frameworks is powerful because it's interconnected. Structuring the WDIP in a familiar way (Introduction, Principles, Structural Components, etc.) makes the entire GGF ecosystem easier for users to navigate and understand. It signals that the WDIP is a core, peer-level component, not just a minor protocol.

2.  **Clarity and Depth:** The outlines we've developed are excellent blueprints, but they leave critical details open to interpretation. A full framework allows you to elaborate on the *how* and the *why*. For a process as nuanced as the WDIP, facilitators and participants will need detailed guidance on methodologies like the "Integrative Resistance & Resonance" framework or the "Sacred Pause" mechanism.

3.  **Legitimacy and Authority:** A comprehensive, well-documented framework carries more weight and credibility than an outline. For the WDIP to be adopted for high-stakes decisions, it must be perceived as robust, thoroughly considered, and complete. A full document demonstrates that level of seriousness.

4.  **Utility for Implementation:** A full framework becomes a practical manual. It can be used for training facilitators, educating stakeholders, and as a stable reference during a live decision-making process. The detailed sections become essential resources for ensuring the protocol is implemented with fidelity.

### Suggested Structure for the Full WDIP Framework

I would suggest mirroring the structure of your `Integrated Meta-Governance` framework, as it provides a logical and comprehensive flow. Here is a proposed table of contents for the full WDIP document:

* **1. Introduction:**
    * Vision & Purpose of the WDIP.
    * Its unique role as the "operating system" for decision-making within the GGF.
    * The core challenge it addresses (making wise choices amid complexity).

* **2. Core Principles:**
    * A detailed exploration of each of the five principles (Holistic Sensemaking, Seven-Generation Scoping, etc.).
    * Provide examples and explain the philosophical underpinnings of each.

* **3. The Core Protocol: A Step-by-Step Guide:**
    * A full chapter dedicated to the five phases of the "Minimum Viable Wisdom" process.
    * Detail the objectives, key actors, and specific activities for each phase (Framing, Listening, Weaving, Choice, Embodiment).

* **4. The Enhancement Modules: A Scalable Toolkit:**
    * A section for each module (Existential Risk, Deep Contention, etc.).
    * Explain the trigger conditions for activating each module.
    * Detail the specific protocols and mechanisms within each (e.g., a deep dive into the "Integrity & Anti-Capture Module").

* **5. Implementation & Facilitation:**
    * Practical guidance for applying the WDIP.
    * The "WDIP Activation Decision Tree" to help users choose modules.
    * Guidelines for training and certifying WDIP facilitators.
    * The "WDIP-Lite" protocol for lower-stakes decisions.

* **6. Integration with the Global Governance Frameworks:**
    * The "Integration Matrix" we discussed.
    * Show exactly how the WDIP connects to and draws upon the Treaty, the Indigenous Framework, the MOS, AUBI, and BAZs.

* **7. Case Models & Pilot Testing:**
    * Outline the proposed bioregional water-sharing pilot case in detail.
    * Include hypothetical scenarios showing how the WDIP would be applied to different problems (e.g., AI governance, climate migration).

* **Appendix:**
    * Glossary of key terms (e.g., "Integrative Resistance").
    * FAQ section addressing common concerns.
    * Visual flowcharts of the process.

Drafting the full framework is the necessary next step to mature the WDIP from a powerful concept into a credible, implementable, and world-changing tool. The detailed outlines and reviews have provided the perfect foundation for this work.
