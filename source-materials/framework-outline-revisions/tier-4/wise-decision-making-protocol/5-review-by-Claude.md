Looking at the v1.1 revision, I'm impressed by how thoughtfully it addresses many of the concerns I raised! This is a significantly stronger framework. Here are my updated thoughts:

## Major Improvements I See

**üéØ The "Minimum Viable Wisdom" Approach is Brilliant**
Breaking it into Core Protocol + Enhancement Modules solves the complexity/practicality tension beautifully. You can start simple and scale complexity only when needed.

**‚ö° Much Better Emergency Protocols**
The Existential Risk Module with deadlock breakers and time pressure protocols addresses my biggest concern about speed/urgency. The "abbreviated processes with mandatory post-decision reviews" is particularly smart.

**üõ°Ô∏è Power Dynamics Much Better Addressed**
- Process Observers for power imbalances
- Resource Asymmetry Protections  
- Shadow Councils for marginalized voices
- These are concrete solutions, not just aspirations

**üîß Practical Implementation Considerations**
The added section shows you're thinking seriously about real-world deployment - timeline realism, resource requirements, cultural adaptation.

## Remaining Areas for Enhancement

### 1. **The "Weaving" Phase Still Needs Work**
This is where the real magic/difficulty happens:

**Cross-System Synthesis Frameworks:**
- The mention of "Bayesian integration" is good, but needs more detail
- How do you actually weight Indigenous prophecy against climate models?
- Need concrete methodologies for when different knowledge systems make contradictory predictions

**Conflict Resolution Protocols:**
- "Integrative resistance" is mentioned but not defined
- What happens when Indigenous councils say one thing, scientific consensus says another, and affected communities want a third option?
- Need specific facilitation techniques for navigating fundamental worldview differences

### 2. **Enhanced Legitimacy & Trust Building**

**Pre-Decision Legitimacy:**
- How do you build public trust in the process before major decisions?
- Need "legitimacy audits" - ongoing assessment of whether communities trust WDIP decisions

**Communication Strategy Details:**
- "Culturally resonant communication" needs specifics
- How do you explain complex seven-generation thinking to immediate-crisis mindsets?
- Need narrative frameworks that help people understand why slow wisdom is worth it

### 3. **Learning & Institutional Memory**

**Cross-Decision Learning:**
- How do lessons from one WDIP process inform future ones?
- Need a "wisdom accumulation" system - institutional memory that gets smarter over time

**Failure Analysis:**
- What happens when a WDIP decision turns out to be wrong?
- Need protocols for learning from failure without losing legitimacy

### 4. **Integration with Existing Systems**

**Compatibility with Current Governance:**
- How does WDIP interface with existing democratic processes?
- What happens when WDIP recommendations conflict with electoral mandates?

**Legal Standing:**
- What legal authority do WDIP decisions have?
- How do you enforce decisions against non-compliant actors?

## Specific Enhancement Suggestions

### **For the Deep Contention Module:**

**"Worldview Translation Protocols"**
- Systematic methods for helping different groups understand each other's fundamental assumptions
- "Perspective-taking exercises" where participants literally role-play other worldviews

**"Sacred Pause Mechanisms"**
- When tensions escalate, mandatory cooling-off periods with ritual/ceremony to restore right relationship
- Elder intervention protocols when the process itself becomes harmful

### **For the Planetary Scale Module:**

**"Cascade Impact Modeling"**
- How decisions ripple through interconnected global systems
- Second and third-order effects on non-participating regions

**"Sovereignty Interface Protocols"**
- How WDIP decisions interact with national sovereignty
- Opt-out mechanisms that don't undermine global coherence

### **New Module Suggestion: "Regenerative Implementation"**

**Healing-Centered Implementation:**
- Every decision must leave relationships and systems healthier than before
- "Regenerative metrics" - how is the implementation actually improving the web of life?
- Mid-course corrections that prioritize healing over efficiency

## Questions for Further Development

### **Practical Testing:**
1. **What would be an ideal first pilot case?** Something complex enough to test the framework but not so high-stakes that failure would be catastrophic
2. **How do you train facilitators?** This requires incredibly sophisticated skills
3. **What's the minimum viable institutional infrastructure?** What do you actually need to exist before this can function?

### **Deeper Philosophical Questions:**
1. **What if different knowledge systems reach genuinely irreconcilable conclusions?** Sometimes Indigenous prophecy, scientific models, and community needs point in completely different directions
2. **How do you balance universal wisdom principles with cultural relativism?** What if some cultures fundamentally reject seven-generation thinking?
3. **What's the relationship between WDIP decisions and democratic sovereignty?** Can wisdom override democracy, or democracy override wisdom?

## Overall Assessment v1.1

This revision addresses most of my practical concerns while maintaining the visionary scope. The modular approach is genuinely innovative - it lets you start simple and scale complexity appropriately.

**Biggest Strength:** The framework now feels both idealistic and practical. It has a clear path from "minimum viable wisdom" to "comprehensive civilizational decision-making."

**Biggest Remaining Challenge:** The "integration" piece - how you actually synthesize radically different ways of knowing into coherent action. This is where the framework will live or die in practice.

**Recommendation:** This is ready for careful pilot testing. I'd suggest starting with a medium-complexity bioregional decision (not too small, not existential-level) to stress-test the integration mechanisms.

The work you've done here represents a genuine breakthrough in thinking about collective decision-making. It deserves serious development and testing.

What's your thinking on pilot cases? And how are you planning to develop the "integration methodologies" that will make or break this in practice?
