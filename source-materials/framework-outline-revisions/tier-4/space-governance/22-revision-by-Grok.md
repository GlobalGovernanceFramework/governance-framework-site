### **Version History:**
- **4.0 (Current):** Repositioned as Cosmic & Extraterrestrial Protocol per Gemini’s instructions. Integrated GSA/SCC into Cosmic Stewardship Council within Meta-Governance, merged Global Space Fund into Global Commons Fund, embedded planetary defense in Planetary Immune System, assigned cultural heritage to Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Framework, and ethical oversight (Prime Directive Protocol) to MOS. Made date-agnostic (e.g., "by Year 5" vs. "by 2030"). Preserved granular details (e.g., debris mitigation, resource management, contact protocols) in appendices.
- **3.1 (Previous):** Original GSGF with standalone GSA/SCC, Global Space Fund, and placeholders.

## **Introduction**
- **Purpose**: Serve as the rulebook for humanity’s space activities, providing licensing, ethical, and defense protocols for off-world exploration, integrated across the global governance ecosystem. Ensures peaceful, equitable, and sustainable cosmic stewardship.
- **Scope**: Covers space debris mitigation, celestial resource management, planetary defense, and extraterrestrial contact, with global coordination, Indigenous wisdom, and ethical governance. Aligns with Treaty, UNCRPD, MOS *Dynamic Rights Spectrum*, and Outer Space Treaty.
- **Vision**: Humanity explores space as a unified, wise civilization, reflecting our highest values of peace, equity, and stewardship.
- **Short-Term Vision (Years 1–5)**: Establish Cosmic Stewardship Council, achieve 80% treaty adoption, deploy debris mitigation in critical orbits, and train 50+ nations in space governance.
- **Worst-Case Contingency**: If targets missed (<60% adoption, <30 nations trained), scale 10 BAZ pilots, redirect $100M from Global Commons Fund. *See Appendix A: Contingency Plans.*
- **Synergy**: Integrates with Meta-Governance (Cosmic Stewardship Council), Treaty (Chamber for Cosmic Law), AUBI (funding), Planetary Immune System (defense), MOS (Prime Directive Protocol), and Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Framework (heritage).
- **Public Engagement**: Framework Family (Full, Light with *Star Trek*-inspired visuals, Core, Technical), accessible formats (VR/AR, sign language, 10+ languages) by Year 3, available at globalgovernanceframework.org/cosmic-protocol. *See Appendix B: Engagement Materials.*

## **Core Principles**
1. **Cosmic Stewardship**: Respect celestial environments and potential alien life.
2. **Equitable Access**: Ensure all nations, especially Global South, participate.
3. **Peaceful Use**: Prohibit offensive weapons, allow defensive systems.
4. **Sustainability**: Mitigate debris, protect heritage zones.
5. **Transparency**: Disclose mission data, collision risks. *See Appendix C: Detailed Principles.*

---

## **Governance Integration**
- **Cosmic Stewardship Council**:
  - **Role**: Specialized Meta-Governance council for space licensing, orbital traffic, and resource policy.
  - **Composition**: 60% national governments (weighted by contribution), 25% civil society (Indigenous, youth), 15% private sector, with regional rotation.
  - **Functions**: License missions, manage orbital traffic (via SCC division), arbitrate disputes, coordinate defense with Planetary Immune System.
  - **Tools**: AI-enhanced tracking, *Cosmic Dashboard*, blockchain transparency.
- **Enforcement**:
  - **Chamber for Cosmic Law**: Sub-unit of Treaty’s Digital Justice Tribunal, arbitrates orbital/resource disputes.
  - **Global Response Teams**: Treaty’s elite units handle space crises (e.g., debris collisions), activated via Planetary Immune System.
- **Ethical Oversight**:
  - **Prime Directive Protocol**: MOS-governed non-interference mandate for extraterrestrial contact, prioritizing observation over interaction.
  - **Cultural Heritage**: Managed by Cultural & Ancestral Wisdom Framework (e.g., Apollo 11 site, Indigenous sacred constellations).
- **Economic Integration**:
  - **Global Commons Fund**: Incorporates launch fees, resource royalties as Cosmic Portfolio ($200M Year 1).
  - **AUBI**: Funds space-related jobs (e.g., debris removal) via Work in Liberation Framework.
- **Planetary Defense**: Handled by Planetary Immune System’s Crisis Command Protocol for existential threats (e.g., >1km asteroids). *See Appendix D: Governance Details.*
