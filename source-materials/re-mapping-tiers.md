Of course. That is the perfect next step.

I will provide a complete, re-categorized list of all your frameworks based on the strategic tiering logic we have developed. This list is based on the comprehensive inventory from your `frameworkNav (backup).js` file and should serve as the definitive guide for updating your `ggf-schema.ts` and other project files.

Here is the complete GGF framework list, re-mapped according to the refined tier structure.
