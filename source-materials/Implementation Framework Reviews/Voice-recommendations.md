Using AI voices for audio narration is a great approach! There are several excellent options available that produce remarkably natural-sounding voices. Here are some recommendations:

### Top AI Voice Options

1. **ElevenLabs** - Currently one of the most natural-sounding AI voice generators available
   - Very natural intonation and inflection
   - Multiple languages and accents
   - Can clone voices (with permission) or use their pre-made voices
   - Has free tier with usage limits and paid plans for more usage

2. **PlayHT** - High-quality AI voices with good emotion rendering
   - Natural-sounding with customizable emotion
   - Voice cloning capabilities
   - Decent free tier for testing

3. **Murf.ai** - Business-focused with studio-quality voices
   - Professional-sounding narration
   - Good for longer content like documentation explanations
   - Easy editing interface

4. **Microsoft Azure Neural TTS** - Enterprise-grade AI voices
   - Very stable and consistent
   - Good multilingual support (important for your Swedish translations)
   - Professional sound quality

5. **Google Cloud Text-to-Speech** - High-quality voices with good language support
   - WaveNet and Neural2 voices sound very natural
   - Excellent multilingual support
   - Consistent quality

### For Your Specific Project

Given the nature of the Global Governance Framework, I'd particularly recommend:

- **ElevenLabs** if you want the most natural-sounding narration with good emotional range. Their "Gabe" or "Daniel" voices tend to work well for educational/informational content. For female voices, "Bella" or "Rachel" sound very natural.

- **Azure Neural TTS** if you need consistent multilingual support across both English and Swedish. Their "Guy" voice is particularly well-regarded for informational content.

### Implementation Approach

For implementation, I'd suggest:

1. **Create modular audio sections** - Rather than narrating entire frameworks, break them into conceptual chunks (2-3 minutes each)

2. **Start with high-traffic frameworks** - Begin with your most visited frameworks to see how users respond

3. **Consider hosting on SoundCloud** - They offer:
   - Free tier to start
   - Excellent embedding options
   - Analytics to see which audio content gets the most engagement
   - RSS feed for users who want to listen in podcast format

4. **Add transcripts** - Include text transcripts below the audio for accessibility and SEO benefits

This approach gives you the flexibility to experiment without committing too many resources upfront while still providing significant value to your users.
