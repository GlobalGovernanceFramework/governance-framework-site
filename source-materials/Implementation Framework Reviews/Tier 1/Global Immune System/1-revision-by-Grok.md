# Global Health & Pandemic Security (GH&PS) Framework Outline

## Preamble & Core Principles

**Vision:** To establish a global immune system that prevents, detects, and defeats pandemics with speed, equity, and resilience, operating as the operational arm under the strategic guidance of the Planetary Health Council.

**Core Principles:**
- **Speed & Solidarity Over Sovereignty (in Crisis):** Rapid, coordinated global action supersedes national interests during Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC).
- **Open Science & Public-First IP:** All health innovations funded by public resources are held in the global commons, free from monopolistic barriers.
- **Radical Equity:** Prioritize marginalized and vulnerable populations in resource allocation and system design.
- **Proactive Prevention:** Emphasize upstream zoonotic and environmental risk mitigation over reactive measures.
- **Subsidiarity:** Empower local and regional systems as the foundation of global health security.
- **Scientific Integrity with Epistemic Humility:** Protect scientific rigor while integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) and community insights.

## 1. Governance Architecture: The Global Immune Command

### 1.1 Global Health Security Council (GHSC)
- **Function:** Central command-and-control body for PHEICs, with binding authority granted by the **Treaty for Our Only Home** (Pillar 3).
- **Composition:** Rotating membership with permanent seats for regional health bodies (e.g., Africa CDC, PAHO), 10% youth delegates (under 30), and representation from Indigenous health organizations and civil society.
- **Powers:**
  - Mandate and enforce global health regulations (e.g., travel, trade, data sharing) during crises.
  - Deploy the Health Emergency Corps (HEC).
  - Oversee equitable allocation of medical countermeasures via a pre-negotiated algorithm.
- **Mechanisms:**
  - **Fast-Track Emergency Protocols:** Streamlined decision-making for rapid response.
  - **Conflict Resolution Ombudsman:** Independent mediator for disputes.
  - **Vetting Mechanism:** Transparent nomination process with strict conflict-of-interest checks to exclude corporate influence.
  - **Biennial Review:** Adaptive governance updates based on implementation feedback.

### 1.2 Health Emergency Corps (HEC)
- **Function:** Professional, rapid-response field teams deployable globally during PHEICs.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Coordinate on-the-ground crisis response, including medical countermeasure distribution and public health interventions.

  - **Distributed Manufacturing Network:** Modular, open-source production hubs in the Global South, activated during crises.
  - **Global Clinical Trial Network:** Coordinated system for equitable, diverse, and rapid trials.

### 2.3 Data and Records System
- **Function:** Secure, interoperable, patient-controlled health records for global access and crisis response.
- **Mechanisms:**
  - **Blockchain-Based Health Records:** Patient-controlled records using HL7 FHIR standards and offline-first mesh networks for low-connectivity areas.
  - **Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) Wallets:** QR code-based access for migrants and refugees, ensuring borderless health rights.
  - **Quantum-Resistant Encryption:** Future-proof data security.
  - **AI Bias Red Teams:** Regular audits to eliminate disparities in health data systems.
