## **Critical Innovations Worth Highlighting**

### **1. Indigenous Data Sovereignty Implementation**
The framework's approach to Indigenous data sovereignty recognizes that "Indigenous data sovereignty describes the fundamental rights of Indigenous Peoples' to control, access, interpret, manage, and collectively own data about their communities, lands, and cultures" - implemented through concrete mechanisms rather than rhetoric.

### **2. Democratic Innovation Architecture**
The combination of:
- Planetary Health Assemblies (citizen oversight)
- Youth councils with veto power
- Community scorecards
- Indigenous sovereignty protocols
Creates genuine democratic control over global health governance.

### **3. Technology Sovereignty**
The framework successfully balances technological capacity with community autonomy through:
- AI-free surveillance options
- Community veto rights over intrusive technologies
- Quantum-resistant security with community control
- Digital divide mitigation with cultural respect

---

## **Remaining Areas for Enhancement**

### **1. Economic Justice Deepening**
**Add:**
- **"Community Economic Empowerment Index"** - measuring how health work builds local wealth
- **"Extractive Industry Health Impact Bonds"** - companies causing health risks pay into prevention fund
- **"Health Commons Dividend"** - direct payments to communities protecting health commons

### **2. Conflict Resolution Mechanisms**
**Strengthen:**
- **Multi-domain crisis protocols** need more detail on resource allocation conflicts
- **Cultural mediation standards** for health intervention disputes
- **Appeal processes** for communities rejecting GHSC emergency measures

### **3. Ecological Integration**
**Consider adding:**
- **"One Health Councils"** - formal integration of human, animal, ecosystem health governance
