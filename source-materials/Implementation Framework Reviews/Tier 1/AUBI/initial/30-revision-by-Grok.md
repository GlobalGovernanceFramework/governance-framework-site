## **2. Introduction: AUBI as the Heart of a Regenerative Civilization**

### **2.1. A Foundation for Right Relationship**
Guided by the **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework**, AUBI is the economic engine for the Treaty’s social contract, ensuring economic security while nurturing **Right Relationship**—the interconnected web of human, non-human, and planetary life. It unlocks potential for innovation, community flourishing, and cultural revitalization, aligned with STR-206.

**Right Relationship Defined:**
- **Economic Security:** Freedom from survival anxiety via a hybrid fiat/Hearts baseline.
- **Relational Wealth:** Prioritizing kinship, community, and ecological harmony (Layer 0).
- **Restorative Justice:** Reparations for historical and ecological harms (Layer 3).
- **Planetary Flourishing:** Contributions to care, culture, and ecology, rewarded by Hearts/Leaves.

**Historical Inspirations:** Indigenous gift economies, Alaska Permanent Fund, Brazil’s Bolsa Família, Finland’s UBI pilot, Kenya’s GiveDirectly, reimagined through Indigenous wisdom for global scalability.

### **2.2. AUBI vs. Traditional UBI**
AUBI is a living system for enacting Treaty promises, channeling Hearts/Leaves through the Love Ledger, guided by Indigenous principles.

| **Feature** | **Traditional UBI** | **Adaptive UBI (AUBI)** |
|-------------|---------------------|------------------------|
| **Philosophy** | Welfare supplement | Expression of Right Relationship and Treaty social contract |
| **Payout** | Fixed fiat | Hybrid fiat/Hearts baseline, dynamic bonuses, Leaves for ecology |
| **Conditionality** | Unconditional | Unconditional baseline + voluntary contributions for Hearts/Leaves |
| **Metrics** | Poverty reduction | LMCI (Right Relationship, care, ecology, culture) |
| **Governance** | State-based | Social Resilience Council under Meta-Governance, Earth Council veto |
| **Cultural Approach** | Universal | Indigenous-guided, community-adapted with FPIC 2.0 |

### **2.3. The Guiding Compass: Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**
LMCI measures flourishing through **Right Relationship**, replacing GDP with metrics of human-land connection, care, and cultural vitality, validated against GNH and OECD Better Life Index.

**LMCI Components:**
- **Love (Care & Relationships):** Care hours, mentorship, social cohesion, validated by communities.
- **Meaning (Purpose & Growth):** Cultural preservation, knowledge sharing, spiritual flourishing.
- **Connection (Human-Land Harmony):** Ecological stewardship, sacred site health, community storytelling.

**Transition Strategy:** LMCI complements GDP for 5 years, with studies showing 7-12% productivity gains from enhanced wellbeing.

**Changes in v5.0:**
- Added LMCI validation against GNH and OECD Better Life Index for scientific rigor.
