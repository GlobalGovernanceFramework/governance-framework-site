## 1. Executive Summary
- **Vision:** To establish a global social safety net ensuring economic security while rewarding contributions to community wellbeing, ecological health, and personal development, fostering a meaningful existence as defined by STR-206 and the "Treaty for Our Only Home."
- **Approach:** AUBI evolves traditional UBI with a dynamic, multi-layered payout system: a universal, locally-adjusted baseline, adaptive bonuses for contributions, and equity-based supplements, leveraging Treaty mechanisms.
- **Goals:** Reduce poverty, validate unpaid care and community work, promote lifelong learning, incentivize ecological stewardship, and foster equitable, resilient societies.
- **Key Features:**
  - Three-tiered payout structure with negative adjustments for harmful activities (capped at 50%).
  - Diversified financing via automation, resource taxes, Commons Dividends, and Hearts currency, with failure switch to Hearts if fiat destabilizes.
  - Optional Holistic Support Framework with burnout prevention for Support Workers.
  - Robust Treaty integration (Global Forensic Corps, Ethical Infrastructure, Reform Accelerator Labs, Foresight Labs, Office of the Adversary).
  - Cultural Adaptation Module with red team audits for conflict resolution.
  - Meaningful Existence Index (MEI) aligned with OECD/WHO/GNH metrics.
  - Failure recovery protocols for inflation or political backlash.
- **Risks:** Gaming of contributions, digital divide, capital flight, work disincentives, and cultural conflicts, mitigated through safeguards, audits, phased rollouts, and economic modeling.
- **Failure Recovery Example:** If inflation exceeds 10% in a pilot, trigger baseline-only payouts, temporary wealth tax, and Reform Accelerator Lab review within 60 days.

## 2. Introduction: The Philosophy of Adaptive Income
### 2.1. A Foundation for a Meaningful Existence
- AUBI ensures economic security for self-determination, unlocking potential for innovation, community building, and cultural development, aligned with STR-206.
- **Meaningful Existence Defined:** A state where individuals have:
  - **Economic Security:** Freedom from survival anxiety (unconditional baseline income).
  - **Autonomy:** Capacity to make life-shaping choices without coercion.
  - **Purpose:** Engagement in valued activities (care, ecology, culture).
  - **Recognition:** Social validation of contributions via Layer 2 bonuses.
- Historical inspirations: Alaska Permanent Fund, Brazil’s Bolsa Família, Finland’s UBI pilot (2017-2018), adapted for global scalability.

### 2.2. AUBI vs. Traditional UBI: Key Distinctions
- AUBI integrates with a pluralistic economy and Treaty pillars (P1-P5), addressing work disincentive critiques through voluntary bonuses and MEI-tracked engagement.

| Feature | Traditional UBI | Adaptive UBI (AUBI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payout** | Fixed, flat-rate | Dynamic, multi-layered, locally-adjusted |
| **Conditionality**| Strictly unconditional | Unconditional **baseline**, voluntary adaptive bonuses |
| **Goal** | Economic floor | Floor **and** regenerative activities, meaningful existence |
| **System** | Fiat-based policy | Treaty-integrated, pluralistic economy |

## 3. Treaty Integration: Dependency Matrix
- AUBI leverages Treaty mechanisms, with Experimental Zones serving as Treaty pilot locations.

| **AUBI Component** | **Treaty Pillar** | **Mechanism** |
|--------------------|-------------------|---------------|
| Financing | P4 (Planetary Health) | Carbon pricing, resource taxes, Sovereignty Bargains |
| Verification | P2 (Global Forensic Corps) | Fraud prevention, adversarial testing |
| Implementation | P1 (Reform Accelerator Labs) | Pilot testing, iterative improvement |
| Equity & Ethics | P5 (Ethical Infrastructure, Foresight Labs) | Cultural adaptation, spiritual care, scenario planning |
| Governance | P3 (Humanitarian Stability) | Conflict zone adaptation, participatory audits |
| Stress-Testing | P5 (Office of the Adversary) | Simulates misuse, cultural conflict scenarios |

## 4. The AUBI Payout Architecture
Three integrated layers ensure security, contributions, and equity, with robust safeguards.

### 4.1. Layer 1: The Universal Baseline
- **Purpose:** Guarantees a basic standard of living for all adults, ensuring dignity.
- **Calculation:**
  - Unconditional for all citizens and permanent residents (including youth post-education).
  - Adjusted via regional price indices (housing, food, utilities), updated via Reform Accelerator Labs.
- **Safeguards:** Global Arbitration Panel resolves disputes; AI-Mediated Impact Simulations model inflation risks.
- **Youth Provisions:** Baseline eligibility starts post-secondary education (age 18), with education stipends bridging the gap.

### 4.2. Layer 2: The Contribution & Development Bonus (Adaptive)
- **Purpose:** Recognizes contributions to the commons, including spiritual care, aligned with P5.
- **Mechanism:** Supplementary amount for verified contributions; negative adjustments for harmful activities (max 50% reduction to preserve dignity).
- **Recognized Contribution Categories:**
  - **Community & Care:** Service, mentorship, integration.
  - **Environment & Sustainability:** Conservation, sustainable transport.
  - **Knowledge & Culture:** Knowledge sharing, cultural preservation.
  - **Personal & Relational Development:** Mentoring, conflict resolution.
  - **Spiritual Care:** Inner development, traditional ceremonies, community rituals, including secular mindfulness practices, verified via community consensus.
- **Meaning Score Pilot:** Experimental metric for emotional wellbeing contributions (linked to STR-206), validated using:
  - OECD Better Life Index (security).
  - WHO autonomy metrics (choice capacity).
  - GNH (Gross National Happiness) for purpose/recognition.
- **Safeguards & Balancing:**
  - **Negative Adjustments:** Applied for verified harmful activities (e.g., environmental pollution, disinformation).
    - **Evidence Thresholds:** Documented proof (e.g., environmental fines, legal convictions).
    - **Process:** Review by Global Forensic Corps, appealable via Global Arbitration Panel within 30 days.
    - **Scale:** 10-50% bonus reduction for 3-6 months; repeat offenses trigger Governance Review (P5 Office of the Adversary).
    - **Examples:** Pollution (20% reduction), disinformation campaigns (30% reduction).
  - **Anti-Gaming Mechanisms:** AI-driven anomaly detection, randomized community audits, Treaty’s Whistleblower Visas for validators facing repression.
- **Work Incentive Measures:** Bonuses tied to contributions (e.g., 10 hours/week care work = 20% bonus increase), with MEI tracking autonomy and purpose.

### 4.3. Layer 3: The Equity & Needs-Based Bonus (Targeted)
- **Purpose:** Addresses systemic inequities, prioritizing marginalized populations.
- **Mechanism:** Supplements based on verified factors:
  - Health conditions and disabilities (aligned with existing disability support systems).
  - Family care responsibilities.
  - Age-related needs.
  - Geographic cost-of-living differences.
- **Inclusivity Enhancements:** Prioritizes low-income regions, conflict zones (P3), and migrant populations with portable MEI scores across Treaty states.
- **Safeguards:** Qualitative Participatory Audits ensure fairness; privacy protections for digital verification.

## 5. Financing and Economic Sustainability
Diversified, Treaty-aligned financing with robust economic modeling.

### 5.1. Primary Revenue Sources
1. **Automation Tax:** Progressive tax on AI and automated production, phased in over 5 years.
2. **Resource & Environmental Taxes:** Fees on resource extraction, land value tax, data extraction, carbon pricing (P4).
3. **Financial Transaction Taxes:** Levies on speculation and trading.
4. **Commons Dividends:** Revenue from shared resources (e.g., public data commons).
5. **Hearts Currency System:** Optional payouts enable participation in global care economy, funding regenerative projects, or accessing Treaty services; failure switch to Hearts if fiat systems destabilize.

### 5.2. Systemic Savings
- Reduces costs of welfare systems, healthcare, crime; improves education outcomes.
- **Transition Pathway:** 5-year phase-out of welfare programs:
  - Year 1: Map overlapping programs, redirect funds to AUBI pilots.
  - Years 2-4: Gradual reduction, retrain welfare staff as Support Workers.
  - Year 5: Full integration, monitored by Reform Accelerator Labs.
- **Macroeconomic Modeling:** AI-Mediated Impact Simulations predict:
  - **Optimistic Scenario:** 2-3% inflation in Year 1, mitigated by phased rollouts.
  - **Conservative Scenario:** 8-10% inflation, addressed by temporary wealth tax and baseline-only payouts.

### 5.3. Capital Flight Mitigation
- Gradual tax implementation with Global Arbitration Panel dispute resolution.
- **Sovereignty Bargains (P4):** Non-compliant states (e.g., tax havens) lose access to Global Public Goods Fund; compliant states gain tech-sharing incentives (e.g., AI ethics labs).
- Incentives for reinvestment in AUBI Experimental Zones.

### 5.4. Failure Scenario Example
- **Scenario:** Simultaneous inflation (8-10%) and capital flight in pilot regions.
- **Response:** Trigger baseline-only payouts, temporary wealth tax (1-2% on top 1%), Reform Accelerator Lab review within 60 days, and shift to Hearts currency payouts if fiat destabilizes.

### 5.5. [Visual Description: Financing Flowchart]
- **Flowchart Concept:** Funds flow from revenue sources (Automation Tax, Resource Taxes, Commons Dividends, Financial Transaction Taxes, Hearts Currency) into a "Global AUBI Fund." Disbursed to Universal Baseline (60%), Contribution Bonus (25%), Equity Bonus (15%). Feedback loops from AI-Mediated Impact Simulations, Participatory Audits, and regional tax collection adjust allocations. Timeline shows funding mix shifting (e.g., automation tax grows from 20% to 40% over 5 years). Failure switch to Hearts currency if fiat systems falter.

## 6. Implementation and Governance
### 6.1. Phased Rollout Model
- **Year-by-Year Timeline:**
  - **Year 1:** Launch pilots in 5-10 regions (e.g., Sweden, Kenya, Bangladesh), funded by Reform Impact Bonds, test MEI validation.
  - **Year 2:** Expand to 20 regions, integrate Layer 2 bonuses, refine verification.
  - **Years 3-4:** Scale to 50% of target populations, add Layer 3, develop legislative changes.
  - **Year 5+:** Nationwide rollout, optimized via Annual Global Institutional Reform Summit.
- **Contingency Plans:** Political backlash addressed via public education campaigns; economic shocks mitigated by temporary payout freezes and tax recalibrations.

### 6.2. Holistic Support Framework
- **Support Workers:**
  - **Role:** Guides for personal development, contribution opportunities, community resources.
  - **Qualifications:** Certification in coaching, community engagement (STR-205), cultural sensitivity training.
  - **Caseload:** Max 75 individuals per worker to prevent burnout.
  - **Ethics:** Non-coercive, transparent boundaries to prevent gatekeeping.
  - **Funding:** AUBI budget, local government partnerships.
  - **Career Pathways:** Progression to regional coordinators or trainers.
  - **Quality Assurance:** Annual audits by local review groups, MEI-tracked job satisfaction.
  - **Burnout Prevention:** 6-month rotations, peer-support networks.
  - **MEI Training:** Support Workers guide self-assessment of meaningful existence metrics.

### 6.3. Verification and Validation
- **Digital Systems:** Blockchain and AI for transparency, with privacy protections (data minimization, encryption).
- **Societal Validation:** Local review groups, expert panels, citizen observers, with Treaty’s Enforcement pillar anti-corruption measures.
- **Anti-Authoritarian Protections:** Independent oversight by Global Arbitration Panel, community veto power, Whistleblower Visas for validators facing repression.
- **Digital Divide Mitigation:** Offline verification via community centers.

### 6.4. Monitoring & Evaluation
- **Meaningful Existence Index (MEI):** Composite metric tracking:
  - **Security:** OECD Better Life Index (housing, income stability).
  - **Autonomy:** WHO autonomy metrics (decision-making capacity).
  - **Purpose/Recognition:** GNH-inspired community-validated contribution hours.
  - Published annually alongside payout levels.
- **Institutional Resilience Index:** Tracks performance.
- **Qualitative Participatory Audits:** Community feedback.
- **Transparency Days:** Annual citizen reviews to vote on fairness, feeding into AUBI refinements.
- **Sunset Review Process:** Periodic evaluation for component phase-out, aligned with Treaty.

## 7. Cultural Adaptation Module
- **Purpose:** Aligns AUBI with local values, co-designed in Experimental Zones.
- **Protocols:**
  - **Indigenous Engagement:** Partner with Indigenous councils to define contributions (e.g., land stewardship).
  - **Authoritarian Contexts:** Encrypted verification, Treaty oversight to prevent state capture.
  - **Religious/Cultural Objections:** Toolkit for community dialogues (e.g., align spiritual care with local beliefs).
  - **Cultural Red Teaming:** Office of the Adversary simulates misuse (e.g., elites capturing bonuses, patriarchal backlash against women’s contributions), reports to Foresight Labs.
- **Migrant/Refugee Adaptations:** Portable MEI scores across Treaty states, ensuring continuity for mobile populations.
- **Examples:** Bangladesh emphasizes women’s cooperatives; Indigenous zones prioritize traditional knowledge; patriarchal contexts audited for gender equity.

## 8. Communication Strategy
- **Public Education Materials:**
  - Simple infographics explaining AUBI’s three layers, MEI, and AUBI Lite.
  - Narratives framing AUBI as a “foundation for flourishing” and “AUBI Patriotism” (rebuilding local economies to counter far-right critiques).
- **Responses to Criticisms:**
  - **Work Disincentives:** Highlight voluntary bonuses, MEI data showing engagement.
  - **Complexity:** Offer AUBI Lite as an entry point.
  - **Fairness:** Emphasize community validation, equity bonuses.
- **Stakeholder Materials:** Tailored guides for governments, NGOs, citizens.
- **Global Governance RPG Module:** Educates on AUBI trade-offs, integrated into AUBI Governance RPG.
