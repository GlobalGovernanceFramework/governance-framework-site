## 1. Executive Summary
- **Vision:** To establish a global social safety net that provides economic security while recognizing and rewarding contributions to community wellbeing, ecological health, and personal development. AUBI enables meaningful existence and societal resilience within the "Treaty for Our Only Home" framework.
- **Approach:** AUBI evolves traditional UBI with a dynamic, multi-layered payout system combining a universal, locally-adjusted baseline with adaptive bonuses tied to participation in the care economy, reparative justice, and other GGF frameworks.
- **Goals:** Reduce poverty and precarity, validate unpaid care and community work, promote lifelong learning, incentivize ecological stewardship, and foster a resilient, equitable global society.
- **Key Features:** 
  - A three-tiered payout structure.
  - A diversified financing model leveraging automation and resource taxes.
  - An optional Holistic Support Framework for personal development.
  - Integration with Treaty mechanisms like the Global Forensic Corps, Ethical Infrastructure pillar, and Reform Accelerator Labs.
- **Risks:** Potential gaming of contribution systems, digital divide in implementation, and capital flight from new taxes, mitigated through robust safeguards and phased rollouts.

## 2. Introduction: The Philosophy of Adaptive Income
### 2.1. A Foundation for a Meaningful Existence
- AUBI ensures economic security as a foundation for self-determination, freeing individuals from financial stress to unlock potential for innovation, community building, and cultural development.
- Historical inspirations include the Alaska Permanent Fund (dividend-based income) and Brazil’s Bolsa Família (conditional cash transfers), adapted for global scalability.

### 2.2. AUBI vs. Traditional UBI: Key Distinctions
- AUBI evolves static UBI into a dynamic, responsive system integrated with a pluralistic economy.

| Feature | Traditional UBI | Adaptive UBI (AUBI) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Payout** | Fixed, flat-rate | Dynamic, multi-layered, locally-adjusted |
| **Conditionality**| Strictly unconditional | Unconditional **baseline**, with **voluntary** adaptive bonuses |
| **Goal** | Provide economic floor | Provide floor **and** incentivize regenerative activities |
| **System** | Policy within existing fiat system | Integrated module of a pluralistic economy with Treaty mechanisms |

## 3. The AUBI Payout Architecture
The system features three integrated layers to ensure security, recognize contributions, and promote equity, with safeguards to prevent misuse.

### 3.1. Layer 1: The Universal Baseline
- **Purpose:** Guarantees a basic standard of living for all adults, ensuring economic freedom and dignity.
- **Calculation:** 
  - Unconditionally provided to all citizens and permanent residents.
  - Adjusted for local cost of living using a standardized methodology based on regional price indices (e.g., housing, food, utilities) updated annually via Treaty-aligned Reform Accelerator Labs.
- **Safeguards:** Global Arbitration Panel resolves disputes over eligibility; AI-Mediated Impact Simulation Tools model payout impacts to prevent inflation.

### 3.2. Layer 2: The Contribution & Development Bonus (Adaptive)
- **Purpose:** Recognizes voluntary contributions to the commons often invisible to markets.
- **Mechanism:** Supplementary amount based on verified contributions, with negative adjustments for harmful activities (e.g., environmental degradation).
- **Recognized Contribution Categories:**
  - **Community & Care:** Community service, care work, mentorship, integration.
  - **Environment & Sustainability:** Conservation, local food production, sustainable transport.
  - **Knowledge & Culture:** Knowledge sharing, cultural preservation, artistic creation, alternative learning.
  - **Personal & Relational Development:** Mentoring, conflict resolution, support groups.
- **Safeguards:**
  - Global Forensic Corps investigates contribution fraud.
  - Office of the Adversary stress-tests verification processes.
  - Whistleblower protections encourage reporting misuse.

### 3.3. Layer 3: The Equity & Needs-Based Bonus (Targeted)
- **Purpose:** Addresses systemic inequities and individual circumstances.
- **Mechanism:** Targeted supplement based on verified needs.
- **Individual Adjustment Factors:**
  - Health conditions and disabilities.
  - Family care responsibilities.
  - Age-related needs.
  - Significant geographic cost-of-living differences.
- **Safeguards:** Qualitative Participatory Audits ensure community feedback on fairness.

## 4. Financing and Economic Sustainability
AUBI’s financing is diversified, Treaty-aligned, and designed to transition from existing systems while addressing capital flight risks.

### 4.1. Primary Revenue Sources
1. **Automation Tax:** Progressive tax on automated production and AI systems, redistributing technological gains.
2. **Resource & Environmental Taxes:** Fees on resource extraction, land value tax, data extraction tax, and carbon pricing.
3. **Financial Transaction Taxes:** Levies on speculation, currency trading, and high-frequency transactions.
4. **Commons Dividends:** Treaty-aligned revenue from shared resources (e.g., public data commons).
5. **Hearts Currency System:** Optional integration with Treaty’s alternative currency for payouts.

### 4.2. Systemic Savings
- Reduces costs of bureaucratic welfare systems, healthcare (from lower stress), crime, and improves education outcomes.
- **Transition Pathway:** 
  - Phase out overlapping welfare programs over 5 years, redirecting funds to AUBI.
  - Reform Impact Bonds fund pilot programs.
  - AI-Mediated Impact Simulation Tools model labor market and inflation impacts.

### 4.3. Capital Flight Mitigation
- Gradual tax implementation with Treaty’s Global Arbitration Panel resolving disputes.
- Incentives for reinvestment in AUBI Experimental Zones to retain capital.

## 5. Implementation and Governance
### 5.1. Phased Rollout Model
1. **Phase 1: Foundational Pilots (Years 1-2):** Pilot baseline AUBI in diverse municipalities, funded by Reform Impact Bonds, with Institutional Resilience Index tracking performance.
2. **Phase 2: Expansion & Integration (Years 2-4):** Expand regions, integrate adaptive and needs-based layers, refine verification using Reform Accelerator Labs.
3. **Phase 3: Full Implementation (Years 5+):** Nationwide rollout, continuous optimization via Annual Global Institutional Reform Summit.

### 5.2. Holistic Support Framework (Optional but Recommended)
- **Support Workers:** Guides for personal development, contribution opportunities, and community resources.
- **AUBI Governance RPG:** Interactive public education tool to simulate AUBI’s impact, integrated into Global Competency Framework’s civic education.

### 5.3. Verification and Validation
- **Digital Systems:** Blockchain-based tracking and AI-supported validation for transparency.
- **Societal Validation:** Local review groups, expert panels, and citizen observers, with anti-corruption measures from Treaty’s Enforcement pillar.
- **Digital Divide Mitigation:** Offline verification options and community-based access points.

### 5.4. Monitoring & Evaluation
- **Institutional Resilience Index:** Tracks performance metrics.
- **Qualitative Participatory Audits:** Gathers community feedback.
- **Sunset Review Process:** Periodic evaluation to refine or phase out components, aligned with Treaty practices.

## 6. Case Study: The Swedish AUBI Model
- **Specifics:**
  - **AUBI as Taxable Income:** Base amount of 15,000 SEK, integrated into progressive tax structure.
  - **Contribution as Tax Reduction:** Contributions (e.g., open-source IT work) reduce tax rates (e.g., 32% to 28%).
  - **Infrastructure:** Leverages `BankID` for verification, with offline options for digital divide.
  - **Legal Reforms:** Amendments to `Socialförsäkringsbalken` and `Plan- och bygglagen`.
  - **Cultural Adaptation:** Community-led validation reflects Swedish communal values.
- **Treaty Integration:** Uses Global Forensic Corps for fraud prevention and Reform Accelerator Labs for iterative improvements.

## 7. AUBI Experimental Zones
- Dedicated zones for testing AUBI variations, aligned with Treaty’s strategy, to refine cultural and economic adaptations.
