## **Executive Summary: A Day in the Life, 2045**
In 2045, in a Tanzanian **Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ)**, you wake secure with **AUBI Layer 1** (70% fiat/$840, 30% Hearts/$360 monthly), ensuring freedom from survival worries. Via the **Community Work App**, you join a **Community Work Team** under Indigenous-led BAZ governance to restore a watershed, earning **AUBI Layer 2 Bonuses** in **Hearts** (20% boost for mentoring youth) and **Leaves** (for ecological work, adjusted by Green Job Score), logged in the **Love Ledger**. Your **Flexible Time** schedule (15-hour cap) respects cultural rhythms, leaving time for creativity. At a **Community Renewal** ceremony, elders and youth validate your team’s **Green Job Score**, guided by the **Fractal Labor Parliament (FLP)** under Meta-Governance, with rapid anti-elite capture responses. **Work With Purpose**—care, creativity, planet health—replaces exploitation, supported by **Tech That Helps**, Indigenous wisdom, and Treaty-aligned coordination. By 2045, 50% of people live this way, with 30% of jobs regenerating ecosystems, sustained by adaptive, Indigenous-guided governance.

## **Introduction: Organizing Work With Purpose**
**Vision**: *Work in Liberation provides the organizational infrastructure for Work With Purpose, channeling AUBI’s economic security into meaningful contributions for care, creativity, and planetary health, guided by Indigenous wisdom and Treaty-aligned Meta-Governance.*

This framework builds on **AUBI’s economic foundation** (Layer 1: universal baseline, Layers 2/3: bonuses in Hearts/Leaves) to organize contributions via **Community Work Teams** and the **Fractal Labor Parliament (FLP)**. It integrates **Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance** (BAZ authority), **Financial Systems Framework** (Hearts/Leaves), **Treaty for Our Only Home** (Ecocide enforcement), and **Meta-Governance Framework** (FLP as Coordination Council). It ensures accessibility, cultural adaptation, and resilience through a 25-year plan.

**System Flow**:
1. **AUBI Layer 1**: Unconditional baseline (70% fiat, 30% Hearts) ensures survival freedom.
2. **Work in Liberation**: Individuals join Community Work Teams via the Community Work App.
3. **Work in Liberation**: Teams perform validated tasks (e.g., caregiving, ecosystem restoration).
4. **AUBI/Financial Systems**: Love Ledger logs contributions, distributes AUBI Layer 2/3 Bonuses (Hearts/Leaves).
5. **Meta-Governance**: FLP sets work standards, Social Resilience Council manages payments.

**Cross-Framework Meta Diagram**:

- **Implementation**: SVG at `workinliberation.org/meta-map` (Q3 2028), color-coded (Hearts: green, AUBI: blue, governance: purple).

**Changes**:
- Clarified Work in Liberation as AUBI’s organizational layer.
- Integrated with Treaty, Meta-Governance, and Indigenous Framework.
- Aligned terminology (Dignity Baseline → AUBI Layer 1, Care Bonus Pay → AUBI Layer 2/3).
