# Planetary Health Accord Implementation Framework Outline

## Executive Summary
The Planetary Health Accord is a transformative framework to ensure equitable, resilient, and sustainable healthcare for all, integrating human, animal, and environmental health. Prioritizing equity, innovation, and global collaboration, it addresses critical gaps through:
- **Governance**: A Global Health Equity Council with regional hubs, inclusive representation, and graduated enforcement.
- **Technology**: AI, blockchain, and open-source solutions with robust privacy and accessibility.
- **Financing**: Tiered taxes, debt swaps, and bonds, backed by economic modeling.
- **Equity**: Focus on marginalized groups, disability rights, and cultural sensitivity.
- **Preparedness**: One Health surveillance and crisis response systems.
Key actions include pilot testing in 3-5 "Health Sanctuary" nations, stakeholder coalition-building, and a "Planetary Health Accord Lite" for early adoption, with economic and political feasibility analyses to ensure scalability.
