# Revised Outline for Economic Integration Framework for Multi-Level Governance

## Executive Summary
- **Vision**: A nested economic system balancing local autonomy with global cooperation to address inequality, resource depletion, and cultural diversity.
- **Approach**: Distinct from EU’s centralized regulations, WTO’s trade focus, degrowth’s anti-growth stance, or doughnut economics’ static boundaries, this framework prioritizes interoperable sovereignty, resource justice, and adaptive governance.
- **Goals**: Achieve 70% local economic sovereignty, 80% equitable resource access, 90% system interoperability by 2035.
- **Key Features**: Community currencies, ethical trade zones, Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI), global commons governance.
- **Stakeholders**: Municipalities, regional councils, NGOs, UN, marginalized communities, with pilots starting in 2026.

## 1. Introduction
   - **Purpose**: Create an equitable, sustainable, and resilient economic integration framework across scales.
   - **Scope**: Address global challenges (inequality, resource depletion, cultural diversity) through nested systems.
   - **Distinctions**:
     - *Vs. EU*: Prioritizes local diversity over harmonized regulations.
     - *Vs. WTO*: Focuses on justice and sustainability, not just trade.
     - *Vs. Degrowth*: Supports growth within ecological limits, not universal reduction.
     - *Vs. Doughnut Economics*: Dynamic interoperability over static thresholds.
   - **Goals**: Equitable resource distribution, regenerative practices, inclusive participation.
   - **Key Principles**:
     - Sovereignty: Local control over economic policies.
     - Interoperability: Seamless value/data exchange.
     - Justice: Equitable access, anti-exploitation.
     - Adaptability: Flexible governance.
   - **Visualization**: Diagram of nested systems (local communities as green circles, regional networks as blue webs, global frameworks as a red sphere, with arrows showing value/data flows).
   - **Key Actors**: Municipalities, regional councils, NGOs, UN, C40 Cities, cooperatives.

## 2. Core Economic Integration Principles
   ### 2.1 Nested Economic Systems
      - **Local**: Community-driven policies (e.g., currencies, resource allocation).
      - **Regional**: Bioregional coordination for resource sharing, trade.
      - **Global**: Planetary standards for fair trade, sustainability.
      - **Prototype**: Mondragon Cooperative (Spain) for regional coordination.
   ### 2.2 Interface Standards
      - **Definition**: Protocols for cross-level exchange (e.g., blockchain-based conversion).
      - **Transparent Value Exchange**: Open APIs for currency conversion, factoring social/ecological costs.
      - **Nested Accountability**: Biannual audits, “Cross-Level Trust Protocol” with arbitration.
      - **Information Flow**: Encrypted open-source platforms, GDPR-compliant.
      - **Example**: Local currency app syncing with regional trade platforms.
   ### 2.3 Resource Justice
      - **Commons-Based Management**: Water, land, energy as commons with nested oversight.
      - **Anti-Exploitation**: Extraction caps (20% below 2020 levels by 2030).
      - **Equitable Access**: AUBI valuing contributions (e.g., caregiving, restoration) via regional points; points interoperate via standardized value indices (e.g., 1 caregiving hour = 10 points, convertible to $5 regionally).
      - **Empowerment**: Marginalized groups lead governance, AUBI design.
      - **Gender Equity**: 50% women/non-binary representation in decision-making; targeted AUBI benefits for gender-based economic gaps.
      - **Prototype**: Bristol Pound (UK) for local currency interoperability.

## 3. Implementation Strategies

      - **Case Study**: Great Lakes Commons reduced water conflicts by 40%.
   ### 3.3 Global Economic Implementation
      - **Mechanisms**: Commons treaties (100% carbon-neutral by 2040), AUBI (basic income → contribution points → integration), financial transparency (Tobin tax), tech commons.
