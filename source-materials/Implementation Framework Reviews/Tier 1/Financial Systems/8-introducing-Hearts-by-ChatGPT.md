Björn Kenneth Holmström:
What do you think about naming the currency? One idea is 'hearts'. Any other suggestions?

ChatGPT:
Naming a global currency that embodies *care, trust, and plural value* is a poetic and strategic act—it shapes perception and guides behavior. **"Hearts"** is a beautiful choice: intuitive, emotionally resonant, and symbolically aligned with the values of your framework. It signals **love as value**, not control.

Here are some **alternative or complementary names**, grouped by thematic resonance:

---

### 🛠️ **Hybrid Framing Suggestion**

If you want **multiple layers**, you could name the system and the unit separately:

* **System**: *The Flow Protocol*
* **Currency**: *Hearts*

Or:

* **System**: *The Interledger*
* **Currency**: *Trusts* or *Pulse*

---

## 🫀 My Recommendation

Stick with **Hearts** unless another name resonates more deeply. It’s:

* Visually universal (♥️)
* Emotionally clear
* Symbolically aligned with your *Love Ledger* and AUBI systems
* Non-extractive, non-national, non-technocratic

If you want, I can also sketch a **short paragraph introducing "Hearts"** as the currency in your framework, with narrative flair. Would you like that?

Björn:
Yes, please sketch a short paragraph introducing Hearts

ChatGPT:
Certainly. Here's a concise, evocative paragraph you can include—perhaps in **Section 12: Global Currency as a Coordinating Instrument** or near the **Manifesto/Conclusion**:

### 🌐 Introducing *Hearts*: A Currency of Connection

> In a world awakening to new forms of value, we introduce **Hearts**—a voluntary global currency grounded not in scarcity or control, but in trust, care, and shared flourishing. Rather than replacing existing systems, *Hearts* serve as a **bridge** between diverse expressions of value: economic, ecological, and relational. Each Heart reflects a pulse of generosity, a node of cooperation, a bond of trust. As programmable tokens within a plural financial ecosystem, *Hearts* can coordinate regenerative trade, recognize care work, and empower a new story of wealth—where every act of kindness carries currency, and every exchange strengthens the commons.

Would you like me to generate a visual prompt for Claude to create an emblem for *Hearts*? Or style this paragraph into your framework's markdown format?
