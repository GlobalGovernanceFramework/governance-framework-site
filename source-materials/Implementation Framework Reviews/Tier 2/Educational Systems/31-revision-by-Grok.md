## **Preamble**
Education is the heartbeat of a regenerative civilization, weaving wisdom, resilience, and purpose. Picture a Sahel girl earning **Hearts** for mapping ecosystems, a Nordic teen shaping **Treaty**-aligned policies, or an Amazonian elder guiding a BAZ-led classroom—all united in a global learning ecosystem. Inspired by the Butterfly Party’s vision (**STR-210**, **TAK-205**), this framework empowers citizens to navigate complexity, restore ecosystems, govern equitably, counter disinformation, resolve conflicts, and embody ethical wisdom. Guided by Indigenous wisdom, **Right Relationship**, and a commitment to dismantling oppression, it fosters a **Spiral-Aware Rights Culture** as defined in the **MOS**, preparing learners for polycrises, embodied learning, and digital democracy.

## **Conclusion**
This framework, as the **Learning and Capacity-Building Engine**, equips citizens to thrive in the **Treaty**, **AUBI**, **Work in Liberation**, **Meta-Governance**, **Peace & Conflict Resolution**, **Synoptic Protocol**, and **GCRSD** ecosystem. Enhanced with **Competency Passport**, **Polycrisis Resilience**, **Somatic Learning**, **Digital Democracy**, and **Futures Literacy**, it fosters regenerative, equitable learning while dismantling oppression. With robust integration mechanisms, it ensures resilience against co-optation and ideological conflicts, preparing learners for a 20-year transition to global adoption.

**Next Steps**:
- Launch 2-3 diverse BAZ pilots (e.g., post-conflict, small-island, urban) with **GCRSD** and university partnerships [cite: 28, 30].
- Develop **learningcommons.org** with offline-first, multilingual design [cite: 30].
- Establish **Youth Research Councils** and **Family Learning Circles** [cite: 30].
