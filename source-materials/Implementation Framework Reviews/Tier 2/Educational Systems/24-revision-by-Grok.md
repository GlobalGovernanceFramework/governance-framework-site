## **Executive Summary**
This framework reimagines education as the **Learning and Capacity-Building Engine** for the global governance ecosystem, cultivating holistic citizens equipped to thrive in and shape the world defined by the Treaty, AUBI, Work in Liberation, and Meta-Governance Frameworks. Rooted in systems thinking, spiral dynamics, neurodiversity, and Indigenous-guided Right Relationship, it fosters regenerative, equitable learning through polycentric networks, youth-led governance, and BAZ-adapted curricula. Integrated with AUBI’s Hearts/Leaves economy, Work in Liberation’s Community Work Teams, and the Treaty’s legal frameworks, it ensures learners contribute to planetary health, equity, and governance. Enhanced with VR/AR pilots, neuroscience, cultural storytelling, and real-time M&E, it is ready for global adoption via UNESCO, BAZ-led pilots, and multi-sector coalitions.

## **Preamble**
At the heart of a regenerative civilization, education weaves a tapestry of wisdom, resilience, and collective purpose. Imagine a Sahel girl earning Hearts for mapping ecosystems, a Nordic teen shaping Treaty-aligned policies, or an Amazonian elder guiding a canopy classroom—all united in a global learning ecosystem. Inspired by the Butterfly Party’s vision (STR-210, TAK-205), this framework transforms education into a pipeline for citizens who navigate complexity, restore ecosystems, and govern equitably, guided by Indigenous wisdom and the principles of the Treaty, AUBI, and Work in Liberation.
