## **Executive Summary**
This framework, the **Learning and Capacity-Building Engine** for the global governance ecosystem, cultivates holistic citizens equipped to thrive in and shape the world defined by the Treaty, AUBI, Work in Liberation, and Meta-Governance Frameworks. Rooted in systems thinking, spiral dynamics, neurodiversity, and Indigenous-guided Right Relationship, it fosters regenerative, liberatory learning through BAZ-led polycentric networks, youth-led governance, and AUBI-integrated curricula. Enhanced with a Political & Economic Transition Toolkit, liberatory pedagogy, data sovereignty, Joy & Wonder Metrics, and low-tech analogs, it ensures resilience, equity, and cultural nuance. Aligned with SDGs, it is ready for global adoption via UNESCO, BAZ-led pilots, and multi-sector coalitions.

## **Preamble**
Education is the heartbeat of a regenerative civilization, weaving wisdom, resilience, and purpose. Picture a Sahel girl earning Hearts for mapping ecosystems, a Nordic teen shaping Treaty-aligned policies, or an Amazonian elder guiding a BAZ-led classroom—all united in a global learning ecosystem. Inspired by the Butterfly Party’s vision (STR-210, TAK-205), this framework empowers citizens to navigate complexity, restore ecosystems, and govern equitably, guided by Indigenous wisdom, Right Relationship, and a commitment to dismantling oppression. The core goal of our civics curriculum is to foster a Spiral-Aware Rights Culture as defined in the [MOS](/frameworks/moral-operating-system).

## **Vision**
To cultivate holistic citizens with the wisdom, skills, and ethics to thrive within and actively shape the global ecosystem defined by the Treaty for Our Only Home, AUBI, and Work in Liberation, fostering regenerative, equitable, and pluriversal governance through Right Relationship and liberatory pedagogy.
