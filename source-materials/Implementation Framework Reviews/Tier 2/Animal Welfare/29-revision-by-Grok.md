## <a id="introduction"></a>1. Introduction

The Global Guardian Framework redefines humanity’s relationship with animals through a "guardianship, not ownership" model, prioritizing the elimination of industrial cruelty while respecting cultural, economic, and ecological realities. Fully integrated into the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF) ecosystem under the Planetary Health Council (PHC), it aligns with the Golden Triangle (Treaty, Meta-Governance, Indigenous Framework) to foster a compassionate, sustainable future for sentient beings and ecosystems, emphasizing low-harm protein pathways and ethical stewardship.

### 1.1 Framework Purpose
The framework addresses systemic deficiencies in animal welfare across industries like industrial agriculture, wildlife trade, and habitat destruction. It promotes a transition to post-slaughter food systems and ethical dairy practices, balancing radical ambition with pragmatic, culturally sensitive implementation to end industrial cruelty while supporting traditional, non-exploitative human-animal relationships.

### 1.2 Scope and Coverage
- **Target Species**: Sentient animals (vertebrates, cephalopods, decapods) and ecologically vital species (e.g., pollinators like bees), with new provisions for insect welfare. Non-sentient organisms and ecosystems are covered by the Planetary Health Governance Framework.
- **Geographic Reach**: Global implementation with regional adaptation, piloting in the Amazon Basin, European agricultural regions, and Southeast Asia.
- **Timeline**: 2025–2035, with immediate actions in 2025 and full compliance by 2035.

### 1.3 Relationship to Planetary Health Governance Framework
Operating under the PHC, the framework complements ecosystem-level protections, leveraging shared governance, monitoring, and economic mechanisms (e.g., AUBI/Hearts, Digital Justice Tribunal) to optimize resources. It ensures holistic planetary stewardship, addressing individual animal suffering and ecological health, contributing to the Biosphere Health Index (BHI).

### 1.4 Sentience Research Integration
- **Scientific Advisory Panel**: Annual reviews of sentience research (e.g., fish pain, insect cognition) from Cambridge, Harvard, and Max Planck to update protection tiers.
- **Emerging Sentience Protocol**: Rapid assessment for new species/entities using quantifiable thresholds (e.g., neural density >10^6 neurons/cm³), validated by peer-reviewed studies.
- **Rapid-Response Science Task Force**: Addresses welfare crises (e.g., factory farm outbreaks) within 48 hours, with <30-day evaluations for urgent edge cases (e.g., AI-bio hybrids).
- **Sentience Research Funding Mandate**: Allocates 5% of the Animal Welfare Council budget to research, with findings in a public-facing sentience database updated quarterly.
- **Open-Source Sentience Algorithms**: Develops algorithms for sentience assessment (e.g., neural complexity, behavioral metrics) for independent validation.
- **Welfare Genomics Research**: Funds ethical gene edits (e.g., stress reduction in livestock via cortisol pathways), overseen by the GTC with public transparency.
- **Citizen Science Integration**: Enables public participation in sentience monitoring via mobile apps, validated by the Scientific Advisory Panel.
- **Insect Sentience Task Force**: Accelerates research on ant/termite cognition by 2027, partnering with Max Planck Institute.

### 1.5 Edge Case Handling
- **Genetic Engineering Ethics**: Mandates welfare standards for lab-created species (e.g., CRISPR targeting TRPV1 receptors), with GTC pre-approval and public consultation.
- **Wild Tech Clause**: Future-proofs for AI-bio hybrids via tiered assessments:
  - **Tier 1 (Clearly Beneficial)**: 2-week fast-track for pain-eliminating modifications.
  - **Tier 2 (Uncertain Impact)**: 6-month review.
  - **Tier 3 (Potentially Harmful)**: 12-month review with moratorium.
- **AI-Bio Hybrid Protocol**: Requires GTC approval for AI-animal hybrids, banning pain-capable synthetic lifeforms.
- **Tier 0 Entities**: Temporary precautionary protections for entities with unclear sentience status until classified within 6 months.

## <a id="core-principles"></a>2. Core Principles
- **Sentience-Centered Protection**: Scales protections with neurological complexity and suffering capacity, updated via annual research reviews.
- **Ecological Necessity**: Allows limited harm for survival needs (e.g., Indigenous subsistence) with Earth Council-approved quotas.
- **Pragmatic Cultural Adaptation**: Supports gradual transitions with traditional ecological knowledge integration, avoiding identity-based framing (e.g., veganism).
- **Scientific Adaptation**: Evolves with sentience research to ensure evidence-based protections.
- **Environmental Synergy**: Aligns with planetary health goals (e.g., reducing factory farming emissions), contributing to the BHI.
- **Slaughter Phase-Out Pathway**: Targets 90% transition to post-slaughter food systems (cultured/plant-based proteins) by 2040, with exemptions for FPIC 2.0-protected subsistence.

## <a id="structural-components"></a>3. Structural Components

### 3.1 Tiered Protection System
- **Tier 0 (Unconfirmed/Emerging Entities)**: Temporary protections for entities with unclear sentience status, reviewed within 6 months.
- **Tier 1 (Primates, Cetaceans)**: No captivity except sanctuaries; establish habitat corridors (e.g., Amazon primate corridors).
- **Tier 2 (Livestock: Cows, Pigs)**: Requires outdoor access, social grouping, and ethical slaughter (gas anesthesia) until 2040 phase-out, with exemptions for Indigenous practices.
- **Tier 3 (Poultry, Fish)**: Enforces stocking density limits and stress-free transport.
- **Tier 4 (Invertebrates: Octopuses)**: Mandates anesthesia for painful procedures, reviewed every 5 years.
- **Tier 5 (Insects)**: Mandates anesthesia for high-sentience species (e.g., honeybees) during hive interventions, based on 2026 sentience review.

### 3.2 Animal Welfare Council
A sub-council under the PHC, replacing the standalone GAWA:
- **Core Functions**:
