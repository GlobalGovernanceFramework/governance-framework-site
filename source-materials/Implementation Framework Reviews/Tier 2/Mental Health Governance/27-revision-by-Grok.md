## **Executive Summary**
The **Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health** is a transformative, rights-based framework prioritizing psychosocial flourishing, equity, and planetary well-being within the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF) ecosystem. Fully integrated with the Golden Triangle (**Treaty**, **Meta-Governance**, **Indigenous Framework**), **Work in Liberation**, **Peace & Conflict Resolution**, **Educational Systems**, and **Synoptic Protocol**, it aligns mental health with planetary health, Indigenous sovereignty, regenerative economics, and epistemic resilience. Key priorities include:
- **Quick Wins**: Integrate mental health into Universal Health Coverage (UHC) with ≥5% budget allocation, pilot community-led task forces in 3-5 diverse regions, and leverage the **Planetary Health Council (PHC)** for oversight.
- **Long-Term Shifts**: Transition to rights-based care, fund initiatives via the **AUBI/Hearts** system, embed mental health in climate, work, education, and epistemic policies, with metrics feeding into the **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)**.
- **Monitoring & Accountability**: Use **Psychosocial Flourishing Metrics** as inputs to the **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**, with community-led monitoring and transparency via the **Digital Justice Tribunal**.

---

## **Quick Start Guide**
1. **Integrate Mental Health into UHC**: Mandate ≥5% of national health budgets, enforced via the **Treaty**’s Pillar 3 (**Digital Justice Tribunal**) with a **Path to Compliance Checklist** (policy reform, training, budget increase).
2. **Pilot Community-Led Task Forces**: Launch in 3-5 diverse regions (e.g., urban Africa, rural Asia, Indigenous Americas) with **Cultural Adaptation Toolkit** and **FPIC 2.0** consent for Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs).
3. **Leverage Planetary Health Council (PHC)**: Oversee mental health governance with a **Traffic Light System** (🟩 Green = compliant, 🟨 Yellow = partial, 🟥 Red = sanctions) and performance benchmarks (e.g., 80% access to care, 50% stigma reduction).

---

## **Principles in Practice Sidebar**
- **Case Example 1 (Kenya)**: Community-led task forces with traditional healers reduced stigma by 30% (2023 pilot data).
- **Case Example 2 (Netherlands)**: Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy Lab improved depression outcomes by 25% under academic oversight (2024 study).
- **Case Example 3 (New Zealand)**: Rights-based care eliminated involuntary hospitalizations, increasing patient trust by 40% (2022 survey).
- **Case Example 4 (India)**: Clinical decision trees for spiritual crises reduced misdiagnosis by 20% in pilot clinics (2024 trial).
- **Case Example 5 (Brazil)**: Awe-based therapy training improved provider empathy by 15% in urban clinics (2025 pilot).
