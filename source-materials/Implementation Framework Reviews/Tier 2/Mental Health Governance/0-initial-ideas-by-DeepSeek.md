Creating a **Global Framework for Mental Health Governance** requires a comprehensive, inclusive, and adaptable approach to address the diverse needs of populations worldwide. Below is a structured outline of key components to include in such a framework:

---

### **1. Vision & Guiding Principles**  
- **Vision:** A world where mental health is universally recognized as a fundamental human right, and all individuals have access to equitable, high-quality mental health care.  
- **Core Principles:**  
  - **Human Rights-Based Approach:** Align with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).  
  - **Equity & Inclusivity:** Prioritize marginalized groups (refugees, LGBTQ+, indigenous peoples, etc.).  
  - **Community Participation:** Involve people with lived experience in policymaking.  
  - **Holistic & Integrated Care:** Link mental health with physical health, social services, and development goals.  

---

### **2. Governance & Institutional Structures**  
- **Global Coordination:**  
  - Strengthen WHO’s leadership while fostering multi-stakeholder collaboration (UN agencies, NGOs, private sector).  
  - Establish a **Global Mental Health Council** for policy coherence.  
- **National-Level Implementation:**  
  - Mandate **National Mental Health Commissions** to oversee strategy.  
  - Integrate mental health into **Universal Health Coverage (UHC)** plans.  
- **Local & Community Governance:**  
  - Decentralize services to local authorities with community-based support systems.  

---

### **3. Legal & Policy Frameworks**  
- **Anti-Discrimination Laws:** Prohibit stigma and ensure workplace/school accommodations.  
- **Mental Health Legislation:** Replace coercive practices (e.g., involuntary hospitalization) with rights-based care.  
- **Data Protection:** Safeguard mental health data privacy under GDPR-like standards.  

---

### **4. Financing & Resource Mobilization**  
- **Sustainable Funding:**  
  - Allocate **at least 5% of health budgets** to mental health (per WHO recommendations).  
  - Innovative financing (e.g., mental health bonds, taxation on harmful products like alcohol/tobacco).  
- **International Solidarity:**  
  - High-income countries fund global mental health initiatives via **ODA (Official Development Assistance)**.  
  - Debt relief for low-income countries investing in mental health systems.  

---

### **5. Service Delivery & Workforce**  
- **Integrated Care Models:**  
  - Train primary care workers in mental health first aid.  
  - Telemedicine and digital tools (e.g., AI chatbots for crisis support).  
- **Workforce Development:**  
  - Address shortages via task-shifting (community health workers).  
  - Global standards for mental health professional training.  

---

### **6. Monitoring, Evaluation & Accountability**  
- **Standardized Metrics:**  
  - Adopt WHO’s **Mental Health Atlas** indicators.  
  - Track SDG 3.4 (mental health promotion) and 3.8 (UHC).  
- **Independent Reviews:**  
  - **Global Mental Health Watchdog** to audit compliance.  
  - Regular reporting to the UN Human Rights Council.  

---

### **7. Crisis & Emergency Response**  
- **Humanitarian Settings:**  
  - Integrate MHPSS (Mental Health & Psychosocial Support) in all disaster responses.  
- **Pandemic Preparedness:**  
  - Include mental health in WHO’s International Health Regulations (IHR).  

---

### **8. Innovation & Research**  
- **Global Mental Health R&D Fund:** Prioritize low-cost interventions.  
- **Ethical AI & Tech:** Guidelines for digital mental health tools.  

---

### **9. Cross-Cutting Themes**  
- **Climate Change:** Address eco-anxiety and mental health impacts of disasters.  
- **Gender Equity:** Target disparities (e.g., depression rates in women, suicide in men).  
- **Youth & Education:** School-based mental health programs.  

---

### **Implementation Strategy**  
- **Phased Rollout:** Pilot in diverse regions (e.g., conflict zones, urban/rural areas).  
- **Stakeholder Partnerships:** Engage civil society, academia, and corporations.  
- **Adaptability:** Customize frameworks for cultural relevance.

This framework balances **global standards** with **local flexibility**, ensuring mental health is embedded in all governance sectors. Would you like to emphasize any specific region or population?
