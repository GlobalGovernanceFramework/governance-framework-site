# Global Framework for Mental Health Governance

## Executive Summary
This framework establishes a rights-based, inclusive, and adaptable global approach to mental health governance, prioritizing psychosocial flourishing, equity, and planetary well-being. Key priorities include:
- **Quick Wins:** Integrate mental health into Universal Health Coverage (UHC), train primary care workers in mental health first aid, and establish community-led task forces.
- **Long-Term Shifts:** Transition to rights-based care models, create a Global Mental Health Commons Fund, and embed mental health in climate and future-of-work policies.
- **Monitoring & Accountability:** Use flourishing metrics (e.g., social connectedness, self-efficacy) and a Global Mental Health Watchdog with public rankings.

## 1. Vision & Guiding Principles
- **Vision:** A world where mental health is a universal human right, fostering psychosocial flourishing through equitable care interconnected with planetary well-being.
- **Core Principles:**
  - **Human Rights-Based Approach:** Align with the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD).
  - **Equity & Neurodiversity Celebration:** Prioritize marginalized groups (e.g., refugees, LGBTQ+, indigenous peoples) and celebrate neurodiversity.
  - **Community Participation:** Involve individuals with lived experiences as "experts-by-experience" in policy design.
  - **Holistic & Ecopsychological Care:** Link mental health with physical health, social services, and planetary health.
  - **Care Ethics:** Emphasize relational and interdependent well-being (e.g., Kittay, Gilligan traditions).
  - **Psychosocial Flourishing Metrics:** Define flourishing via measurable indicators like social connectedness, meaning, and self-efficacy, tracked via surveys.

## 2. Governance & Institutional Structures
- **Global Coordination:**
  - Strengthen WHO leadership, fostering collaboration with UN agencies, NGOs, private sectors, and **multi-stakeholder councils** with rotating citizen seats.
  - Deploy **AI-assisted governance dashboards** and **community scorecards** (low-tech alternative) to track needs and bottlenecks, addressing digital divides.
  - Promote **transgovernmental collaboration** for cross-border challenges (e.g., migration trauma, online harms).
- **National-Level Implementation:**
  - Mandate **National Mental Health Commissions** with diverse representation.
  - Integrate mental health into **UHC** frameworks.
- **Local & Community Governance:**
  - Decentralize services to local authorities, supported by **community-led task forces** for accessibility and cultural relevance.

## 3. Legal & Policy Frameworks
- **Anti-Discrimination Laws:** Enforce laws to combat stigma and ensure accommodations in workplaces and schools.
- **Mental Health Legislation:** Transition from coercive practices to rights-based care, with **sunset clauses** for outdated laws and transition protocols.
- **Rights-Based Stewardship Models:** Replace legal personhood with guardianship councils to protect mental health ecosystems.
- **Restorative Justice:** Implement processes for mental health-related conflicts (e.g., forced treatment).
- **Data Protection:** Adopt GDPR-like standards for mental health data privacy.

## 4. Financing & Resource Mobilization
- **Sustainable Funding:**
  - Allocate **≥5% of national health budgets** to mental health, enforced via **sanctions/rewards** (e.g., trade incentives, conditional aid).
  - Establish a **Global Mental Health Commons Fund** via global solidarity mechanisms (e.g., digital taxes, carbon dividends).
  - Use innovative financing (e.g., mental health bonds, taxes on alcohol/tobacco).
- **International Solidarity:**
  - High-income countries fund global initiatives via **Official Development Assistance (ODA)**.
  - Offer debt relief for low-income countries investing in mental health.
- **Community-Based Budgeting:** Implement participatory budgeting for local priorities.
- **Right to Rest:** Link mental health to work-time reduction policies.

## 5. Service Delivery & Workforce
- **Integrated Care Models:**
  - Train primary care workers in mental health first aid.
  - Use telemedicine and AI chatbots with **safeguards against algorithmic bias** and **low-tech alternatives** (e.g., community health worker outreach) to address digital divides.
  - Incorporate **peer-led healing networks**, **elder-youth co-support structures**, **spiritual care**, **traditional healing systems**, and **psychedelic-assisted therapy** (piloted via academic/NGO partnerships).
- **Workforce Development:**
  - Address shortages through task-shifting to community health workers.
  - Establish global standards for mental health professional training, ensuring scalability of pluralistic care.

## 6. Monitoring, Evaluation & Accountability
- **Standardized Metrics:**
  - Adopt WHO’s **Mental Health Atlas** indicators and SDG 3.4/3.8, including **flourishing metrics** (e.g., social connectedness, self-efficacy).
  - Collect **disaggregated data** by gender, race, and disability for equity analysis.
- **Community-Led Monitoring:** Use storytelling and participatory action research.
- **Independent Reviews:**
  - Establish a **Global Mental Health Watchdog** with enforcement mechanisms (e.g., public rankings, conditional aid).
  - Require regular UN Human Rights Council reporting.
- **Transparency Dashboards:** Co-design with neurodivergent and marginalized groups.

## 7. Crisis & Emergency Response
- **Humanitarian Settings:**
  - Integrate **Mental Health and Psychosocial Support (MHPSS)** into disaster/conflict responses.
  - Deploy a **Global Mental Health Rapid Response Team** trained in trauma care and cultural protocols, coordinated with state/non-state actors.
- **Pandemic Preparedness:**
  - Embed mental health in WHO’s **International Health Regulations (IHR)**.
- **Digital First Response:** Develop protocols for digital mental health support, including collective grief processing online.

## 8. Innovation & Research
- **Global Mental Health R&D Fund:** Prioritize scalable, low-cost interventions.
- **Open-Access Research Commons:** Ensure global equity in access to findings and tools.
- **Pluralistic Epistemologies:** Support spiritual, indigenous, and experiential knowledge.
- **Sandbox Zones:** Experiment with novel models (e.g., Ubuntu circles, psychedelic co-ops via academic/NGO partnerships).
- **Ethical AI & Technology:** Develop enforceable guidelines for digital mental health tools.

## 9. Cross-Cutting Themes
- **Climate Change:** Address eco-anxiety and disaster-related trauma.
- **Gender Equity:** Tackle disparities (e.g., depression in women, suicide in men).
- **Youth & Education:** Implement school-based mental health programs.
- **Intergenerational Trauma & Healing:** Focus on post-colonial and post-conflict settings.
- **Digital Mental Health Ethics:** Promote platform designs for emotional well-being (e.g., safe social media).
- **Future-of-Work Mental Health Policies:** Support mental health in AI-driven economies, emphasizing rest, creativity, and play.

## 10. Implementation Strategy
- **Phased Rollout:** Pilot in diverse contexts with **radical pilots** (e.g., psychedelic co-ops) in academic/NGO partnerships.
- **Stakeholder Partnerships:** Engage civil society, academia, and corporations via **community-led task forces**.
- **Adaptability:** Customize for cultural relevance while maintaining global standards.
- **Iteration Loops:** Incorporate quarterly community feedback cycles.
- **Living Document Model:** Maintain as a versioned governance whitepaper or open GitBook.

## Visual Representation
- Develop a **systems map** illustrating feedback loops (e.g., stigma reduction → workforce growth → better care access).
- Co-design with **neurodivergent artists** to ensure accessibility and inclusivity.
