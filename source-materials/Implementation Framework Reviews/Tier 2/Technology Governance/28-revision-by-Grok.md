# Technology Governance Implementation Framework (Revised Outline)

## 1. Preamble: Technology as World-Building
- From Prometheus’ fire to the weaver’s loom, from the printing press to the digital neuron, technology is humanity’s act of world-building—a sacred responsibility to shape reality with wisdom, care, and reverence. It holds the power to weave communities together, restore ecosystems, or unravel the fabric of existence if left unchecked. This framework embraces technology as a partner in co-creating a regenerative, inclusive, and ethically aligned future, guided by the collective wisdom of human and non-human stakeholders, rooted in the rhythms of the Earth, and committed to justice for all beings.

## 2. Introduction: From Reactive Regulation to Proactive Stewardship
- **Purpose**: Establish a governance framework ensuring technology supports interoperability, ethical alignment, and societal benefit while mitigating risks.
- **Vision**: Foster collaboration among diverse governance models, integrating human and non-human stakeholders (e.g., AIs, smart systems) for a shared, regenerative future.
- **Call for Collaboration**: Invite global input to co-create and refine the framework, emphasizing inclusivity and epistemic pluralism.

## 3. Framework Position within the Golden Triangle
- **Context**: This framework operates under:
  - The **Treaty** (legal authority and enforcement via Pillar 3, including the Digital Justice Tribunal).
  - **Meta-Governance** (coordination and interoperability principles).
  - **Indigenous Framework** (ethical guidance, emphasizing relational worldviews and ecological balance).
- **Role**: Provides specific rules and bodies for governing technology, ensuring alignment with global ethics, rights of beings, and existential risk governance.

## 4. Core Principles
- **Transparency**: Publicly accessible decision logs and audits.
- **Inclusivity**: Diverse stakeholder representation, including marginalized and indigenous voices.
- **Scalability**: Adaptable across scales, from local projects to global systems.
- **Ethical Alignment**: Human oversight for high-stakes decisions, prioritizing safety and fairness, guided by the Moral Operating System (MOS) and its Dynamic Rights Spectrum.
- **Risk-Aware Design**: Fail-safe defaults and proactive risk mitigation.
- **Technological Self-Determination**: Communities, especially indigenous ones, have the right to adapt or reject technologies based on cultural values.
- **Subsidiarity in Innovation**: Locally developed technologies posing no cross-border risks require lighter governance to encourage grassroots innovation.

## 5. The Global Technology Council (GTC): Structural Components
- **Overview**: A Meta-Governance Coordination Council overseeing global technology governance.
- **Composition**:
  - 40% technical experts (e.g., AI, biotech, blockchain specialists).
  - 30% civil society and affected communities (e.g., end-users, marginalized groups).
  - 20% ethicists and legal scholars (ensuring alignment with global ethics).
  - 10% youth delegates (representing future generations).
- **Powers**:
  - Develops interoperable standards (e.g., open APIs) and governance protocols.
  - Evaluates technologies using the MOS Dynamic Rights Spectrum to assess rights and responsibilities of new entities (e.g., AIs, cyborgs).
  - Recommends global policies, including potential moratoriums on high-risk technologies.
  - Coordinates with sub-committees: Office of Biotechnology Stewardship (ecosystem impacts) and Emerging Technology Assessment Panels (nascent tech risks).
- **Decision-Making**: 
  - Transparent protocols with public decision logs and quarterly stakeholder reviews.
  - Decisions with significant intergenerational impact (e.g., climate engineering, germline biotechnology) **and all proposed moratoriums on high-risk technologies** (e.g., autonomous weapons) require a **double majority**: a majority vote of the full council, plus a separate majority vote of youth delegates.
  - Community Review Boards audit GTC decisions locally to ensure accountability and alignment with regional needs.
- **Minimum Viable Governance**: For smaller projects, includes public logs and periodic reviews.

## 6. Oversight & Accountability: Aurora Accord & Digital Justice Tribunal
- **Aurora Accord Integration**: All data-using technologies must comply with the Accord’s Office of Algorithmic Accountability.
  - AI-Specific Red Flag Protocols: Define thresholds for autonomy limits, model drift, and failsafe triggers, enforced by the Accord.
- **Digital Justice Tribunal**: Adjudicates major harms under the Treaty’s Pillar 3, with authority to impose sanctions or corrective measures.
- **Graduated Sanctions**:
  - **Level 1: Public Disclosure**: Formal, public notice of non-compliance.
  - **Level 2: Economic Penalties**: Fines and exclusion from Hearts-based regenerative tech funds.
  - **Level 3: Technical Restriction**: Mandated revocation of API access or interoperability with GGF-aligned systems.
  - **Level 4: Full Sanctions**: Trade bans and other enforcement measures as authorized by the Treaty for Our Only Home.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Harmonization strategies for conflicting regulatory regimes, using mutual recognition agreements and adaptive compliance frameworks.

## 7. Indigenous Sovereignty in Tech Governance
- **Earth Council Role**: Holds veto power over the deployment of any technology with significant and irreversible impacts on terrestrial or aquatic ecosystems, ensuring alignment with ecological and cultural priorities.
- **Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC 2.0)**: Required for tech deployment in or near Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs).
- **FPIC for Urban & Diasporic Communities**: The GTC, in partnership with the Earth Council, will fund **Digital FPIC Portals** to facilitate consultation and consent processes with urban and diasporic Indigenous communities not geographically located within a BAZ. Portals will include toolkits and resources translated into 50+ Indigenous languages, with funding prioritized for Indigenous-led translation efforts.
- **FPIC Rapid Response Teams**: For high-stakes or contentious technology deployments, the Earth Council can dispatch trained mediation teams, composed of Indigenous and technical experts, to facilitate the FPIC 2.0 process on the ground when digital portals are inadequate.
- **Technological Self-Determination**: Indigenous communities can reject or adapt technologies to align with cultural and ecological values.
- **Epistemic Pluralism**: Incorporates indigenous, spiritual, and non-Western governance traditions to inform sustainable practices.

## 8. Key Governance Mechanisms
- **Interoperability Mechanisms**: Cross-system connectors (e.g., shared data formats, GDPR ↔ CCPA agreements).
- **Meta-Governance Layer**:
  - Oversight boards with annual self-audits (Reflexivity Clause).
  - Sunset Clause: Rules expire after 5 years unless renewed.
  - Decentralized options (e.g., DAOs, participatory design).
- **Bottom-Up Innovation**: Lightweight governance for grassroots tech, balancing standardization with innovation freedom.
- **Crisis Governance Mode**:
  - Links to Meta-Governance crisis protocols, enabling rapid response to AI races, cyberwarfare, or black-swan events.
  - GTC can recommend global moratoriums on high-risk technologies, with decisions executed via the Treaty’s Pillar 3 enforcement (e.g., Digital Justice Tribunal).
  - Activation of emergency powers requires a **Double-Lock approval**: a supermajority vote from the GTC, ratified by the Earth Council within 72 hours to ensure alignment with ecological and cultural principles.
  - Crisis measures auto-expire within 30 days unless approved by **Planetary Health Assemblies**.
  - **Public Crisis Impact Diaries**: During the activation of any emergency powers, the GTC must maintain a public, real-time impact diary documenting decisions, rationale, and observed social and ecological consequences, both positive and negative.

## 9. The Regenerative Tech Economy
- **Funding**: Public-interest tech funded via the Treaty’s Pillar 4, with a dedicated **Regenerative Tech Fund** sourced from the Treaty’s Automation Tax, managed by the GTC.
  - The Fund will also manage a **"GGF-Aligned Technology" Certification Program**, awarding public recognition and digital badges to projects that demonstrate exceptional adherence to the framework’s ethical and technical standards.
- **Hearts and Leaves Incentives**: Contributions earning Hearts and Leaves currency in the AUBI Layer 2 system include:
  - Developing open-source, privacy-preserving tools.
  - Creating technologies for ecological restoration (e.g., carbon capture, rewilding support).
  - Building platforms enhancing democratic participation or community empowerment.
  - Documentation, teaching, and scaling of traditional and Indigenous technologies (e.g., advanced water-harvesting techniques, sustainable agriculture practices, non-electric food preservation) that contribute to community resilience and ecological health.
- **Environmental Impact**: Mandatory checklists for energy use, sustainability, and material footprints, aligned with Planetary Boundaries and circular economy principles.
