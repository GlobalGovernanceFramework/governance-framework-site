## **1. Preamble: Technology as World-Building**
From Prometheus’ fire to the weaver’s loom, from the printing press to the digital neuron, technology is humanity’s act of world-building—a sacred responsibility to shape reality with wisdom, care, and reverence. It holds the power to weave communities together, restore ecosystems, or unravel existence if unchecked. This framework embraces technology as a partner in co-creating a regenerative, inclusive, ethically aligned future, guided by human and non-human wisdom, rooted in Earth’s rhythms, and committed to justice for all beings.

---

## **2. Introduction: From Reactive Regulation to Proactive Stewardship**
- **Purpose**: Ensure technology supports interoperability, ethical alignment, and societal benefit while mitigating risks, serving as the GGF’s "constitutional parent" for tech governance.
- **Vision**: Foster collaboration among diverse governance models, integrating human and non-human stakeholders (e.g., AIs, ecosystems) for a regenerative future.
- **Call for Collaboration**: Invite global input via **Public Trust Dashboard**, emphasizing inclusivity and epistemic pluralism.
- **Scope**: Governs all technologies via **TRRT** (Tier 1–4), delegating domain-specific rules to sub-frameworks (e.g., **Aethelred Accord**, **Aurora Accord**).

---

## **3. Framework Position within the Golden Triangle**
- **Context**: Operates under:
  - **Treaty for Our Only Home**: Legal authority, enforcement via **Digital Justice Tribunal**.
  - **Meta-Governance Framework**: Coordination and interoperability.
  - **Indigenous Framework**: Ethical guidance, relational worldviews, ecological balance.
- **Role**: Provides universal principles, bodies, and tools (e.g., **TRRT**, **Tech Governance Starter Kit**, **Ethical Circuit Breaker**) for technology governance, ensuring alignment with global ethics, rights, and specialized frameworks.

---

## **4. Core Principles**
