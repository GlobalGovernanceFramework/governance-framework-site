## **Introduction**
- **Purpose**: Serve as the scientific brain and ecological conscience of the global governance ecosystem, providing standards, metrics (*Ecosystem Health Indicators*, *Dynamic Rights Spectrum*), and ethical technology protocols (*AI Consciousness Assessment Framework*) to guide BAZ-led restoration, Treaty enforcement, and AUBI rewards. Aligns with Paris Agreement, SDGs (13, 15), and Post-2020 Global Biodiversity Framework.
- **Scope**: Operates across local (BAZ), regional, and global (Planetary Health Council) scales, integrating with Treaty, AUBI, Work in Liberation, Meta-Governance, and Indigenous Frameworks.
- **Vision**: By 2050, a regenerative world where ecosystems are rights-holders, BAZs lead restoration, and technologies align with *Right Relationship*, guided by Indigenous wisdom and *Spiral-Aware* ethics.
- **Short-Term Vision (2026–2030)**: Achieve 30% ecosystem restoration in BAZ pilots, 50% AUBI adoption for ecological work, 25 ecosystems with legal personhood.
- **Worst-Case Contingency**: If targets missed (<20% restoration, <40% AUBI), scale 20 BAZ pilots by 2032, redirect $30B from Global Commons Fund, fund 2,000 Indigenous-led microgrants. *See Appendix A: Contingency Plans.*
- **Synergy**: Guides Treaty Ecocide law, AUBI rewards (Hearts/Leaves), Work in Liberation teams, Meta-Governance councils, Indigenous BAZ governance, TGIF’s ethical tech standards, UNFCCC NDCs, and water-energy-food nexus coordination.
- **Public Engagement**: Executive Summary, One-Page Essence, Public Engagement Pack, and 6-episode podcast series available at globalgovernanceframework.org, in 10 languages plus Quechua (2027), per *Accessibility Implementation Matrix*. *See Appendix B: Engagement Materials.*
