## **Plain Language Summary**
This framework ensures clean water and sanitation for all, treating water as a sacred, shared resource, not a commodity. It empowers communities, centers Indigenous wisdom, and uses innovative financing to create equitable, climate-resilient systems. Tools like the **BAZ & Community WASH Starter Kit** and ethical safeguards make it practical and fair. See **Appendix B: Regional Implementation Blueprints** for strategies tailored to diverse contexts (e.g., urban, coastal, conflict zones).

---

## **Theory of Change**
Water and sanitation challenges stem from systemic inequities, environmental degradation, and governance failures. By embedding human rights, blue democracy, and regenerative principles within the GGF ecosystem, this framework transforms WASH through inclusive policies, equitable financing, and biomimetic technologies. Community-led governance, supported by global institutions and adaptive systems, drives equitable access, climate resilience, and ecosystem restoration, achieving SDG 6 and fostering planetary justice across geological time scales.

---

## **Framework Position within the Golden Triangle**
The **Global Framework for WASH Governance** is empowered by the **Treaty for Our Only Home** through enforceable mechanisms like the **Digital Justice Tribunal** (Pillar 3) for hydrological justice and **Global Equity Ombudsperson** (Pillar 2) for grievances. It is guided by the **Indigenous Framework**, embedding **Rights of Nature** principles and **Earth Council (Kawsay Pacha)** oversight for sacred ecosystems. The **Meta-Governance Framework** coordinates via a **Global Water & Sanitation Council**, aligning with **Planetary Health Council**, **Work in Liberation Framework**, **AUBI**, **Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health**, and **Synoptic Protocol**. WASH metrics feed into the **Biosphere Health Index (BHI)** and **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**. The **Aurora Accord** ensures data sovereignty.
