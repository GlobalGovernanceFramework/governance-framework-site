# Global Framework for Water & Sanitation (WASH) Governance

This framework integrates all suggestions from Claude’s final review, elevating the previous iteration into a transformative, holistic, and implementable blueprint for global WASH governance. Aligned with SDG 6 and related SDGs (e.g., SDG 5, SDG 13, SDG 16), it incorporates quantum governance, regenerative principles, cosmic perspectives, and biosophic approaches to ensure universal access, planetary healing, and future-readiness. Advanced financial, technical, and monitoring systems, alongside deep cultural and spiritual integration, position it as the ultimate standard for equitable, sustainable, and resilient water stewardship.

## Theory of Change
Water and sanitation challenges stem from systemic inequities, environmental degradation, and governance failures. By embedding human rights, blue democracy, and regenerative principles, this framework transforms WASH through inclusive policies, innovative financing, and biomimetic technologies. Multi-level, self-evolving institutions, empowered communities, and conscious leadership drive equitable access, climate resilience, and ecosystem restoration, achieving SDG 6 and fostering planetary justice across geological time scales.

## 1. Guiding Principles
- **Human Rights-Based Approach**: Uphold water and sanitation as universal rights (UN A/RES/64/292, A/RES/70/169).
- **Water as a Sacred, Commons, Non-Commodified Public Good and Living Entity**: Recognize water’s spiritual, cultural, ecological, and legal personhood (e.g., Māori *Te Awa Tupua*), rejecting speculative commodification (e.g., water futures trading) and countering neoliberal narratives (e.g., World Bank conditionalities prioritizing profit). Protect communal stewardship (e.g., Andean *ayllu* councils). *Operational Definition*: Non-commodification ensures access as a right, balanced with equitable market tools (e.g., stewardship incentives).
- **Intergenerational Responsibility**: Ensure future access via 50-year impact assessments and temporal justice for past/future generations.
- **Sustainability**: Balance ecological, economic, and social factors within planetary boundaries.
- **Equity & Inclusion**: Prioritize marginalized groups (women, rural, urban poor, Indigenous, migrants, climate refugees, unbanked, LGBTQ+), with gender targets (50% women in governance roles).
- **Transparency & Accountability**: Foster trust through open governance and anti-corruption measures.
- **Climate Resilience**: Integrate adaptive strategies for climate challenges (e.g., droughts, floods).
- **Anti-Privatization Safeguards**: Oppose predatory privatization, supporting ethical public-private partnerships.
- **Trauma-Informed WASH**: Address conflict/disaster survivors’ needs (e.g., gender-sensitive sanitation).
- **Decolonial Lens**: Center Indigenous and local knowledge to undo extractive legacies.
- **Planetary Healing**: Promote restoration through water governance, addressing historical traumas.
- **Principles Hierarchy**: Prioritize human rights and equity in conflicts, guided by participatory processes. *Application Examples*: Equity over profit in drought allocation; Indigenous rights over corporate claims in sacred water disputes.
- **Regenerative Governance**: Embed healing-centered approaches for institutions and communities.
- **Biosophic Wisdom**: Integrate living systems principles (e.g., watershed biomimicry).
- **Cosmic Perspective**: Frame decisions in geological and universal time scales.

## 2. Institutional & Policy Framework
