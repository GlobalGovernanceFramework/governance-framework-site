### **Radical Framework for Disability Rights & Inclusion in Global Governance**  
**Title:** *"Nothing About Us Without Us – A Liberated Future for All Bodies and Minds"*  

This framework reimagines global governance through **disability justice**, **intersectional solidarity**, and **post-capitalist access**, centering the leadership of disabled communities. It dismantles ableist systems and replaces them with **universal design**, **collective care**, and **embodied sovereignty**.  

---

## **Core Principles**  
1. **Embodied Sovereignty**  
   - Every body/mind has the right to **self-determination**, including refusal of forced treatment or institutionalization.  
   - Legal recognition of **neurodivergence**, **chronic illness**, and **madness** as valid ways of being.  

2. **Radical Access**  
   - **Universal design** mandated in all infrastructure, digital spaces, and governance systems.  
   - **"Access as a Human Right" Protocol**: No policy is valid unless co-created with disabled communities.  

3. **Intersectional Disability Justice**  
   - Centering **disabled BIPOC, queer, poor, and incarcerated** voices in all decisions.  
   - Reparations for **eugenics, forced sterilization, and institutional violence**.  

4. **Post-Capitalist Care Ecosystems**  
   - Replace exploitative care systems with **community-led mutual aid networks**.  
   - **Global Care Income**: Guaranteed livelihood for caregivers and disabled people.  

5. **Non-Human & Post-Human Solidarity**  
   - Rights for **AI, assistive tech, and service animals** as partners in access.  
   - **"Crip Technoscience"**: Disabled-led innovation in biotech, AI, and adaptive design.  

---

## **Structural Components**  
### **1. Global Disability Assembly (GDA)**  
- A **binding decision-making body** composed of:  
  - Disabled elders, youth, and activists (50% from Global South).  
  - **"Nothing About Us Without Us" Councils** in every nation.  
  - **AI observers** trained on disability justice principles.  
- **Powers**: Veto over policies violating disability rights, budget control over accessibility funds.  

### **2. Access Ombuds Network**  
- **"Access Auditors"** with authority to:  
  - Shut down inaccessible spaces (physical/digital).  
  - Enforce **Universal Design Tribunals** with reparative fines.  

### **3. Abolition of Ableist Systems**  
- **Close all institutions**; replace with **community-based care**.  
- **Ban forced treatment** (e.g., involuntary commitment, ABA therapy).  
- **End subminimum wages** globally; mandate **pay equity for disabled workers**.  

### **4. Crip Technoscience Labs**  
- Disabled-led R&D hubs for:  
  - **Open-source prosthetics**, **augmentative tech**, and **AI communication tools**.  
  - **"Biohacking for Liberation"** (e.g., DIY wheelchair repairs, neural interface design).  

### **5. Global Care Cooperative**  
- A **decentralized care network** where:  
  - Caregivers are paid living wages.  
  - Disabled people control their care plans.  
  - **"Care Credits"** system allows reciprocal exchange beyond money.

## **Implementation Timeline**  
### **Phase 1: Abolition & Repair (2025–2030)**  
- **Abolish all institutions**; redirect funds to **housing-first policies**.  
- **Reparations payments** to survivors of eugenics and forced treatment.  
- **Mandate universal design** in all new infrastructure.  

### **Phase 2: Radical Access (2030–2040)**  
- **AI-powered real-time translation** for all sign languages.  
- **Global Disability Strike** to enforce accessibility laws.  
- **Neurodiversity schools** replace standardized education.  

### **Phase 3: Post-Capitalist Crip Futures (2040–2050+)**  
- **"Care Villages"** replace nuclear family models.  
- **Disability-led climate adaptation** (e.g., "slow cities" for chronic illness).  
- **Governance by "Crip Time"** (flexible, non-linear decision-making).  

---

## **Key Mechanisms**  
- **Accessibility Courts**: Fast-track justice for access violations.  
- **Disability Impact Assessments**: Required for all policies.  
- **Algorithmic Justice**: Ban AI that discriminates (e.g., biased hiring algorithms).  

---

## **Expected Outcomes**  
- **Zero preventable disability deaths** (e.g., from neglect, poverty).  
- **100% accessible public spaces** by 2040.  
- **Abolition of ableism** as a governing logic.  

---

### **Why This Framework?**  
- **Beyond "Inclusion"**: Rejects tokenism for **liberation**.  
- **Prevents Co-Option**: Disabled leadership is non-negotiable.  
- **Intersectional & Global**: Centers those most marginalized by current systems.
