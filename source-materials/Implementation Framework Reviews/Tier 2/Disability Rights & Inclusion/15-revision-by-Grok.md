# Executive Summary
The *Radical Disability Freedom Framework* reimagines governance through disability justice lens, centering disabled leadership to dismantle ableism and build universal design, collective care, and liberated sovereignty. Key innovations include the Global Disability Assembly (GDA) with veto power, Access Ombuds Network enforcing universal design, Crip Technology Labs for disabled-led innovation, Care Cooperatives for equitable care, and an "Ableism Tax" funding reparations. Integrating intersectional justice, climate action, and AI ethics, it targets zero preventable disability deaths and 100% accessible spaces by 2040. A "Framework Light" aligns with UNCRPD for early adoption, supported by pilots, coalition-building, and a Just Transition for workers.

## 1. Vision
- **Title**: *Nothing About Us Without Us* – A Liberated Future for All Bodies and Minds*
- **Goal**: Transform global systems via disability justice, intersectional solidarity, and post-capitalist access.
- **Core Approach**: Center disabled leadership to eradicate ableist structures and foster universal design, collective care, and embodied sovereignty.
- **Rights of Nature**: Recognize toxic environments (e.g., pollution, climate disasters) disproportionately harm disabled bodies, integrating ecological health with climate reparations.
- **Visual Aid**: 
  - **Diagram Prompt**: Circular infographic with "Disabled Leadership" center, radiating to six segments (Embodied Sovereignty, Radical Access, Intersectional Justice, Post-Capitalist Care, Non-Human Solidarity, Rights of Nature), with icons (e.g., wheelchair repairs, tree).
  - **Visual Toolkit**: Draft SVGs/mockups at [repository link placeholder] for advocacy, including a Framework Summary Infographic for schools/campaigns.

## 2. Core Principles
1. **Embodied Sovereignty**
   - Right to self-determination, rejecting forced treatment or institutionalization.
   - Legal recognition of neurodivergence, chronic illness, and mental diversity through UNCRPD reforms to depathologize conditions by 2030.
2. **Radical Access**
   - Mandate universal design, meeting WCAG 2.4+ for digital platforms by 2030.
   - "Access as a Right" Protocol: No policy valid without disabled co-creation.
3. **Intersectional Justice**
   - Center disabled BIPOC, queer, poor, and incarcerated voices.
   - Reparations for eugenics, forced treatments, and climate-induced disabilities.
4. **Post-Capitalist Care Systems**
   - Replace exploitative care with community-led mutual aid networks.
   - Global Care Income: Guaranteed livelihoods, funded by institutional budgets and "Ableism Tax."
5. **Non-Human Solidarity**
   - Rights for AI, assistive tech, and animals as access partners.
   - "Crip Tech": Disabled-led innovation in biotech, AI, adaptive design.
6. **Rights of Nature**
   - Advocate for environmental policies prioritizing disability justice.

## 3. Structural Components
1. **Global Disability Alliance (GDA)**
   - **Composition**: Disabled elders, youth, activists (50% Global South), national councils, AI observers trained in justice principles.
   - **Powers**: Veto over non-compliant policies, control accessibility funds.
   - **AI Accountability**: AI observers report to oversight boards with audits; non-compliant developers face license revocation.
   - **Coalition-Building**: Partner with UN agencies (WHO, UNESCO) to integrate GDA by 2027.
   - **Visual Aid**: Flowchart of GDA structure, showing central node, regional councils, AI observers, oversight boards.
2. **Access Ombuds Network**
   - **Role**: Enforce universal design via audits, with power to close facilities or fine via Universal Design Courts, livestreamed.
   - **Transition**: Pilot audits in urban centers by 2028.
   - **Enforcement**: Graduated ladder (warnings, fines, closures); appeals to International Disability Rights Tribunal; GDA peer reviews.
   - **Visual Aid**: Workflow: "Identify Inaccessibility" → "Issues" → "Court Ruling" → "Audit."
3. **Abolition of Ableist Systems**
   - Close institutions via pilots (20% budget redirect by 2028), funded by healthcare budgets and "Ableism Tax." Hybrid models ease transitions.
   - Ban forced treatments by 2030; peer-led therapy alternatives.
   - End subminimum wages; pay equity by 2032.
   - **Prison Abolition**: Decarcerate disabled individuals via restorative justice by 2031.
   - **Just Transition**: Retrain institutional/prison workers for Care Cooperative roles, funded by a Just Transition Fund ($10B by 2030).
4. **Crip Technology Labs**
   - Disabled-led R&D for open-source prosthetics, AI tools, brain-computer interfaces.
   - Support "Biohacking for Liberation" (e.g., DIY wheelchair repairs).
   - **Data Privacy**: GDPR-compliant protocols, decentralized storage.
5. **Care Cooperatives**
   - **Details**: Decentralized network, paid caregivers, disabled-led plans, "Care Contributions" system, creating 1M jobs by 2035.
   - **Funding**: Institutional budgets, "Ableism Tax," grants (2% high-income GDP, 0.5% low-income).
   - **Visual Aid**: Infographic of network nodes connected by care exchanges.

## 14. Why This Framework?
- Rejects tokenism for liberation.
- Disabled leadership non-negotiable.
- Intersectional, global focus.

## 15. Spiral-Aware Inclusion Track
- **Purple (Tribal)**: Integrate elders’ wisdom via storytelling.
- **Red (Power)**: Boycotts, strikes against resistance.
- **Blue (Legal)**: Pitch Accessibility Courts as equality-aligned, reducing legal liability (e.g., to Ministries of Justice).
- **Orange (Corporate)**: Frame Crip Tech Labs as market innovation, expanding customer base (e.g., to tech firms).
- **Green (Community)**: Intersectional justice, mutual aid.
- **Yellow/Turquoise (Holistic)**: Post-capitalist futures, Crip Time.

## 16. Framework Light
- **Focus**: UNCRPD-aligned accessibility, independent living.
- **Proposals**:
  - Mandate WCAG 2.4+ for public digital platforms by 2030.
  - Fund 10 Care Cooperative pilots by 2027 ($100M).
  - Establish national accessibility audits by 2028.
- **Purpose**: Entry point for governments, UN bodies; builds momentum for full framework.

## 17. Theory of Change
- **Allies**: Disability organizations, climate justice groups, labor unions, progressive governments (e.g., Costa Rica).
- **Targets**: UNCRPD Committee, national parliaments, tech corporations.
- **Leverage**:
  - Legal: Use CRPD Article 9 to mandate accessibility.
  - Corporate: ESG pressure for "Ableism Tax" compliance.
  - Public: Global Disability Strike, storytelling campaigns.
- **Path**: Pilots (2025–2027) prove value; UN resolution (2026) builds legitimacy; first adopters (2030) scale globally.

## 18. Addressing Concerns
- **GDA Veto**: Suspensive veto requiring policy revision, not gridlock, balancing sovereignty.
- **Abolition**: Just Transition Fund ($10B by 2030) retrains workers for Care Cooperatives, with union partnerships.
- **Ableism Tax**: Caps prevent consumer cost pass-through; tax revenue funds accessibility, not profits.

## 19. Disability Governance Compact
- 5-page UNCRPD/SDG-aligned version at [repository link placeholder] by 2026.
