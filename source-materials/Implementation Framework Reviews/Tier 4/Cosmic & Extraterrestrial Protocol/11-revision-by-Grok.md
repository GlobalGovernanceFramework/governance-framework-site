# Global Space Governance Framework (GSGF)

## Preamble: A Dialogue with the Cosmos
*What does it mean to be stewards of the stars?* Humanity stands at the threshold of the cosmos, not as conquerors, but as guardians of a shared heritage. This framework guides our exploration with humility, unity, and reverence for all life, ensuring space remains a realm of peace, discovery, and interbeing for generations to come.

## Overview
A comprehensive framework to ensure sustainable, secure, equitable, and cooperative space activities, balancing peaceful exploration with preparedness for existential threats like asteroids or hypothetical extraterrestrial risks, while fostering ethical stewardship, global inclusivity, robust enforcement, and participatory governance.

## 1. Foundational Principles
*When we gaze at the stars, do they gaze back?* These principles anchor humanity’s cosmic journey in ethics and responsibility.

- **Peaceful Use**: Prohibit offensive weapons in space (per Outer Space Treaty, 1967) while allowing defensive systems for asteroid deflection and satellite protection.
- **Sustainability**: Mitigate space debris, regulate resource extraction, and protect celestial environments.
- **Equitable Access**: Ensure fair participation for all nations, including emerging spacefaring countries.
- **Transparency & Trust**: Mandate disclosure of mission details, orbital data, and collision risks.
- **Preparedness**: Enable defensive capabilities for planetary protection (e.g., asteroid deflection) and hypothetical extraterrestrial threats.
- **Ethical Exploration**: Prioritize non-exploitative interactions with celestial bodies, respecting potential alien ecosystems or future AI probes. Non-exploitative criteria include: minimizing environmental disruption, preserving scientific integrity, and avoiding commercial overreach.
- **Cultural & Scientific Openness**: Recognize space exploration’s civilizational value, ensuring shared scientific knowledge and cultural heritage preservation.
- **AI Autonomy Limits**: Prohibit fully autonomous systems in space without human oversight. Define AI autonomy levels (1–5):
  - Level 1: Basic automation (e.g., scripted satellite maneuvers).
  - Level 2: Assisted decision-making (e.g., AI-enhanced SSA).
  - Level 3: Limited autonomy with human veto (e.g., debris removal bots).
  - Level 4: Conditional autonomy with strict oversight (e.g., asteroid deflection systems).
  - Level 5: Fully autonomous (prohibited to prevent unintended actions).
- **Non-Proliferation**: Ban research and development of autonomous space weapons, even for defensive purposes, to prevent dual-use technology escalation.
- **Cosmic Dialogue**: Promote space exploration as a collaborative dialogue with the cosmos, implemented through mandatory public hearings for GSA decisions and transparent mission reporting.

## 2. Charter of Cosmic Rights
*If the Moon could speak, what would it ask of us?* A symbolic, non-binding charter to affirm the dignity of celestial bodies, potential alien life, and future sentient entities.

- **Celestial Dignity**: Celestial bodies shall be respected as shared heritage, free from wanton destruction.
- **Life’s Potential**: Any discovered lifeforms, sentient or otherwise, shall be approached with non-harm and curiosity.
- **Future Sentience**: Artificial intelligences or other sentient entities in space shall be granted ethical consideration.
- **Intergenerational Equity**: Space exploration shall preserve opportunities for future generations.
