  - Add **mental health support** protocols for crisis teams.  

#### **12. Global Scaling (Grade: 87/B+)**  
- **Strengths**: Coalition-building with progressive governments is strategic.  
- **Suggestions**:  
  - **Years 6-10**: Address **scaling fatigue** with modular adoption options.  
  - Include **resistance strategies** for conservative institutions.  

#### **13. Framework Evolution (Grade: 94/A)**  
- **Strengths**: Annual review and failure analysis demonstrate humility.  
- **Suggestions**:  
  - Add a **"Sunset Clause"** for outdated components.  
  - Publish **yearly transparency reports** on adaptations.  

#### **14. Conclusion & Resources (Grade: 93/A)**  
- **Strengths**: "Quick Reference Resources" boost usability. CC license encourages adaptation.

### **Overall Grade: 92/A-**  
**Strengths**:  
- Unprecedented in bridging contemplation, philosophy, and governance.  
- Exceptional cultural sensitivity and risk mitigation.  
- Actionable toolkits for diverse contexts.  

**Critical Improvements**:  
1. **Power & Equity**: Embed explicit anti-oppression frameworks (e.g., intersectional analysis).  
2. **Decolonization**: Add protocols for **reparative justice** in knowledge integration.  
3. **Crisis Governance**: Develop **"Wisdom Triage"** for urgent decisions (e.g., <24h).  
4. **Tech Ethics**: Address surveillance risks in AI tools.  
5. **Modularity**: Allow **partial adoption** for resistant institutions (e.g., "Contemplative Lite").  

**Quote for Reflection**:  
*"A framework this comprehensive must resist becoming its own bureaucracy."*  

**Next Steps**:  
- Publish **Tier 2 Implementation Guide** with step-by-step playbooks.  
- Launch a **Global Wisdom Practitioner Registry** to share learnings.  
- Conduct a **stress-test simulation** with policymakers to identify gaps.  

This revision is a **quantum leap** forward—now refine its edges without diluting its ambition.
