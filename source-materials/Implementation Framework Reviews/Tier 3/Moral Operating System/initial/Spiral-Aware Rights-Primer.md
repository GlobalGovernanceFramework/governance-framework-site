# 🌀 **Spiral-Aware Rights Primer**  
*Understanding How Worldviews Shape Ethics, Rights, and Responsibility*

---

### 🌍 Why It Matters  
People and cultures don't see the world in the same way.  
Some prioritize survival. Others, tradition. Others, freedom. Others, systems thinking.  
If we want to create **universal ethics**, we must understand these **worldview layers**.

*A developmental map of worldviews and how they perceive rights*
Each stage is a way of **making sense of the world**.

| 🟡 Yellow      | Systems & Flexibility            | Rights are contextual, adaptive, and network-sensitive           | *“Let’s integrate complexity.”*     |
| ⚪ Turquoise   | Interbeing & Holism              | Rights emerge from unity with all life, planet, cosmos           | *“All is sacred.”*                  |
| 🟧 Coral       | Paradigm Shift & Coherence       | Rights as reality-reshaping contracts—tools for phase transition | *“Let’s evolve what rights mean.”*  |
