- **Improvement**: Add an appendix mapping all acronyms for quick reference.

## Top 5 Recommendations for Improvement:

1. **Visual Frameworks**: Add diagrams showing:
   - Governance structure
   - Conflict resolution pathways
   - Ecosystem integration matrix

2. **Enhanced Digital Strategy**:
   - Blockchain for sacred data
   - AI disinformation protocols
   - Low-tech alternatives

3. **Measurement Framework**:
   - Quantitative KPIs for all objectives
   - Impact assessment methodology

4. **Crisis Preparedness**:
   - Detailed pandemic/conflict protocols
   - Alternative funding scenarios

5. **Expanded Representation**:
   - "Emerging Traditions" category
   - Neurodiversity representation guidelines

## Innovation Highlights (Where This Excels):

- **FPIC 2.0 Integration**: Exceptional respect for Indigenous rights
- **Dynamic Rights Spectrum**: Sophisticated conflict resolution mechanism
- **Sacred Data Protocol**: Cutting-edge approach to digital spirituality
- **Transformative Dialogue Protocol**: Trauma-informed peacebuilding
- **Meta-Governance Coordination**: Brilliant systems integration

This framework sets a new standard for interfaith governance systems. With some refinements in measurement and visual communication, it could serve as a global model. The attention to both ancient wisdom and modern technology is particularly impressive.
