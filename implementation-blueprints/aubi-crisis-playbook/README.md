## 1. Purpose

This toolkit will provide the governing bodies of the AUBI system (e.g., the Social Resilience Council, BAZ leaders) with a detailed, actionable playbook for navigating and mitigating economic, political, and technical crises. Its goal is to ensure the resilience and stability of the AUBI system under stress.

## 2. Intended Audience

* Members of the Social Resilience Council and regional steward councils
* BAZ administrative leaders
* Members of the Treaty's Pillar 3 Humanitarian Stability Corps
* GGF's internal "Governance War Games" simulation teams

## 3. Core Components

This toolkit will be developed from the detailed protocols found in earlier AUBI framework revisions. The final playbook will include:

* **Economic Stress Testing Protocols:** Detailed procedures for managing specific economic shocks, including cryptocurrency volatility, rapid AI-driven productivity acceleration, and global recessions.
* **Failure Cascade Prevention Mechanisms:** Protocols to isolate failing pilot regions and prevent contagion, including emergency resource reallocation plans.
* **Detailed Crisis Response Scenarios:** Step-by-step responses for hyperinflation, capital flight, and political backlash, including trigger thresholds and specific countermeasures like temporary wealth taxes and shifting to baseline-only payouts.
* **Governance Crisis Protocols:** Clear guidelines for emergency authority, succession planning for council members, and managing inter-council coordination during a crisis.
* **Governance War Game Scenarios:** A set of pre-designed simulations for training leaders and stress-testing the framework's resilience against "Central Bank Coups" or "Validator Strikes".
