## 1. Purpose

This toolkit will provide the GGF Catalyst's Ecosystem Lab and its partners with the strategic narratives, media assets, and educational tools required to build broad public understanding, political will, and grassroots support for the AUBI framework.

## 2. Intended Audience

* The GGF's internal communications and ecosystem-building teams
* Partner NGOs and civil society organizations
* Community organizers and BAZ-level facilitators
* Educators and curriculum developers

## 3. Core Components

This toolkit will be developed from the detailed communication strategies and visual concepts found in earlier AUBI framework revisions. The final kit will include:

* **Core Narrative & Messaging Guides:** Including the "AUBI for Humanity" story, framing for different political ideologies (AUBI Patriotism), and the "AUBI Mythology Toolkit" for cultural embedding.
* **Visual Identity & Data Visualization Briefs:** Design briefs for core visual metaphors like the AUBI-LMCI System Flowchart, the Financing Flowchart (Sankey Chart), and the public-facing AI Feedback Dashboard.
* **Public Education Campaign Materials:** Templates for interactive documentaries, social media campaigns (#HeartsEconomy, #AUBIForHumanity), and educational games.
* **Criticism Response Package:** A set of evidence-based talking points and case study summaries to address common criticisms related to work disincentives, complexity, and economic sustainability.
