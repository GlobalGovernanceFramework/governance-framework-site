<p>The <em>Stakeholder Engagement Charter Template</em> is a customizable tool to formalize inclusive collaboration among stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, youth, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local governments, and private sectors—implementing the <em>Food Systems &amp; Agriculture Framework</em>. It establishes a shared commitment to equitable, transparent, and resilient food systems, aligning with the framework’s <a href="/framework/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles">Core Principles</a> of sustainability, equity, resilience, and transparency. Designed for pilot projects or broader initiatives, this charter supports the framework’s <a href="/framework/docs/implementation/food-systems#05-stakeholder-engagement">Stakeholder Engagement</a> goals and is part of the <a href="/framework/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip">Start with the Seed Kit</a>.</p>
