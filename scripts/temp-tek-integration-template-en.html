<p>The <em>TEK Integration Template</em> is a customizable tool to guide stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local governments, and private sectors—in respectfully incorporating Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) into food system initiatives under the <em>Food Systems &amp; Agriculture Framework</em>. TEK, defined as indigenous and local environmental wisdom, is central to achieving sustainable and equitable food systems, as outlined in the framework’s <a href="/framework/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms">Integration of TEK</a>. This template ensures TEK is integrated ethically, aligning with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and the framework’s <a href="/framework/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles">Core Principles</a> of equity and sustainability. It is part of the <a href="/framework/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip">Start with the Seed Kit</a> and supports pilot projects or broader implementation.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The template provides a structured approach to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify relevant TEK sources and practices.</li>
<li>Engage indigenous communities as co-governors and knowledge holders.</li>
<li>Integrate TEK into agricultural or food system practices.</li>
<li>Monitor and evaluate TEK’s impact to ensure cultural and ecological benefits.</li>
<li>Commit to ethical principles respecting indigenous rights.</li>
</ul>
<p>This tool fosters inclusive collaboration, ensuring indigenous voices lead the integration process, and supports the framework’s goal of training 500,000 farmers in TEK by 2030.</p>
<p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: This template helps you work with indigenous communities to use their traditional knowledge, like special farming methods, to make food systems better while respecting their rights.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports UNDRIP, SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), and SDG 15 (Life on Land).</p>

<p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Fill in the blanks for your project, talk with indigenous leaders, write down the plan, share it carefully, and check it every year.</p>
<h2>TEK Integration Template</h2>
<h3>Purpose and Context</h3>
<p><strong>Purpose</strong>: This TEK Integration Plan for [Project Name] aims to incorporate Traditional Ecological Knowledge into [specific goal, e.g., a regenerative farming pilot] in [Region] to enhance sustainability, equity, and resilience in alignment with the <em>Food Systems &amp; Agriculture Framework</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>: [Describe the local context, e.g., drought-prone region with indigenous communities practicing crop rotation]. The plan respects indigenous rights per UNDRIP and seeks to [list outcomes, e.g., improve soil health, preserve local crop varieties].</p>
<p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Explain why and where you’re using indigenous knowledge, like improving farms in a dry area.</p>
<h3>Identifying TEK Sources</h3>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Identify relevant TEK practices and knowledge holders to inform the project.</p>
<p><strong>Steps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Map Knowledge Holders</strong>: Collaborate with [e.g., local indigenous councils, elders] to identify TEK experts, targeting [number, e.g., 5–10] contributors.</li>
<li><strong>Document Practices</strong>: Record TEK practices (e.g., [specific practice, e.g., intercropping, seed saving]) through [method, e.g., interviews, workshops], ensuring cultural sensitivity.</li>
<li><strong>Validate Sources</strong>: Verify TEK with community leaders to ensure accuracy and respect, completing validation by [date, e.g., Q2 2025].</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>In [Region], indigenous elders share knowledge of drought-resistant crop varieties, documented in a community-led workshop.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Find out who knows traditional farming methods, write them down respectfully, and check with community leaders.</p>
<h3>Engaging Indigenous Communities</h3>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Establish respectful, co-governance partnerships with indigenous communities, as outlined in <a href="/framework/docs/implementation/food-systems#05-stakeholder-engagement">Stakeholder Engagement</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Strategies</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Initial Engagement</strong>: Hold [number, e.g., 2–3] co-design workshops with [e.g., indigenous councils, women’s groups] by [date, e.g., Q1 2025] to shape TEK integration.</li>
<li><strong>Co-Governance Roles</strong>: Assign [e.g., 50%] representation to indigenous leaders in [e.g., steering committee], ensuring decision-making authority.</li>
<li><strong>Compensation</strong>: Provide fair compensation (e.g., [amount, e.g., $500 per workshop], knowledge-sharing grants) for TEK contributions, respecting community protocols.</li>
<li><strong>Cultural Protocols</strong>: Follow [e.g., community-specific guidelines, UNDRIP principles] for sharing and using TEK, avoiding appropriation.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A workshop in [Region] engages 20 indigenous farmers to co-design a seed-saving program, with elders leading decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Meet with indigenous groups, let them lead, pay them fairly, and follow their rules for using their knowledge.</p>
<h3>Integrating TEK into Practices</h3>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>: Apply TEK to specific food system practices, aligning with <a href="/framework/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives">Strategic Objectives</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Integration Plan</strong>:</p>
