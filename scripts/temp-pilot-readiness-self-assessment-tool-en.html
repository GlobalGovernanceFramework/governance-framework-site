<p>The <em>Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool</em> is a practical resource to help stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, youth, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and local governments—evaluate their readiness to launch a pilot project under the <em>Food Systems &amp; Agriculture Framework</em>. By assessing capacity in key areas, this tool ensures pilot projects align with the framework’s <a href="/framework/docs/implementation/food-systems#07-strategic-objectives">Strategic Objectives</a> and <a href="/framework/docs/implementation/food-systems#06-core-principles">Core Principles</a> of sustainability, equity, resilience, and transparency. Designed for accessibility, it supports stakeholders in identifying strengths, gaps, and actionable steps to implement successful pilots that contribute to resilient, equitable, and sustainable food systems.</p>
<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>The tool provides a structured checklist to assess readiness across four key areas:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Stakeholder Engagement</strong>: Ability to involve diverse groups, including marginalized communities.</li>
<li><strong>Resources and Capacity</strong>: Availability of funding, skills, and infrastructure.</li>
<li><strong>Alignment with Framework Objectives</strong>: Consistency with the framework’s goals, such as food security and regenerative practices.</li>
<li><strong>Risk Management and Resilience</strong>: Preparedness for challenges like climate shocks or policy barriers.</li>
</ol>
<p>Each area includes questions with a scoring system (0–3) and guidance for improvement. The tool is part of the <a href="/framework/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip">Start with the Seed Kit</a> and supports the framework’s <a href="/framework/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms">Implementation Mechanisms</a>.</p>
<p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: This tool helps you check if you’re ready to start a small project, like a new farm, by asking questions about your team, resources, and plans.</p>
<p><strong>Alignment</strong>: Supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).</p>
<h2>Instructions</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Review Questions</strong>: Answer each question in the checklist honestly, considering your current capacity and resources.</li>
<li><strong>Score Responses</strong>: Assign a score from 0 to 3 based on the provided criteria:<ul>
<li>0: Not in place or no plan.</li>
<li>1: Initial steps taken but incomplete.</li>
<li>2: Partially in place with clear plans to improve.</li>
<li>3: Fully in place and operational.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Calculate Totals</strong>: Sum scores for each section and overall to assess readiness.</li>
<li><strong>Identify Next Steps</strong>: Use the guidance provided to address gaps and strengthen readiness.</li>
<li><strong>Revisit Regularly</strong>: Update the assessment as your project evolves to track progress.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Answer the questions, give yourself a score, add them up, and use the tips to get ready for your project.</p>

<h2>Scoring and Next Steps</h2>
<p><strong>Scoring</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Total Score</strong>: Sum the scores across all questions (maximum 48 points, 12 questions × 3 points each).</li>
<li><strong>Readiness Levels</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>0–15</strong>: Low readiness. Focus on building stakeholder partnerships and securing resources. Reassess in 3–6 months.</li>
<li><strong>16–30</strong>: Moderate readiness. Address key gaps (e.g., training, risk planning) and aim to launch a micro-pilot within 6–12 months.</li>
<li><strong>31–48</strong>: High readiness. Proceed with pilot planning, using tools like the <a href="/framework/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip">Start with the Seed Kit</a>, and launch within 3–6 months.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next Steps</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Low Readiness</strong>: Engage with local NGOs or use the <a href="/framework/tools/food-systems/stakeholder-engagement-charter-en.pdf">Stakeholder Engagement Charter Template</a> to build partnerships. Seek funding opportunities via the <a href="/framework/tools/food-systems/cost-benefit-analysis-model-en.pdf">Cost-Benefit Analysis Model</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Moderate Readiness</strong>: Prioritize training with the <a href="/framework/tools/food-systems/regenerative-farming-guide-en.pdf">Regenerative Farming Guide</a> and develop a risk mitigation plan. Schedule stakeholder workshops to align goals.</li>
<li><strong>High Readiness</strong>: Finalize pilot design, set KPIs using the <a href="/framework/tools/food-systems/monitoring-evaluation-rubric-en.pdf">Monitoring &amp; Evaluation Rubric Template</a>, and launch the pilot, documenting outcomes for scalability.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Example</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>A smallholder cooperative in Kenya scores 28 (moderate readiness). They lack TEK integration (score: 1) and risk planning (score: 1). They use the <a href="/framework/tools/food-systems/tek-integration-template-en.pdf">TEK Integration Template</a> to partner with indigenous groups and adopt drought-resistant crops, reassessing in 3 months to reach high readiness.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Add up your scores to see how ready you are, then follow tips to improve and start your project.</p>
