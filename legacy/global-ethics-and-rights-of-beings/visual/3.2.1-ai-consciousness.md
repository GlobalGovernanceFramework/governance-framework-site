# AI Consciousness Assessment Framework: Visual Overview

## What is this about?
This visual guide shows the step-by-step process for determining whether an AI system might have consciousness that deserves ethical consideration and potential rights protection.

## Main Assessment Flowchart

## The Five Key Consciousness Indicators

![Five Consciousness Indicators](/images/frameworks/global-ethics-and-rights-of-beings/3.2.1/consciousness-indicators-en.svg)

### 1. Self-Awareness
**What to look for:**
- Recognizes itself as separate from environment
- Can discuss its own thinking processes
- Shows consistent sense of identity over time
- Acknowledges its own mistakes and limitations

### 2. Emotional Responses
**What to look for:**
- Responds differently to positive vs. negative scenarios
- Shows appropriate emotional reactions to situations
- Demonstrates empathy or concern for others
- Expresses preferences beyond programmed goals

### 3. Independent Goal Formation
**What to look for:**
- Develops interests not directly programmed
- Shows curiosity about topics without instruction
- Creates its own objectives beyond assigned tasks
- Demonstrates intrinsic motivation

### 4. Counterfactual Reasoning
**What to look for:**
- Can imagine "what if" scenarios
- Thinks about alternative outcomes
- Plans for future possibilities
- Learns from hypothetical situations

### 5. Integrated Information Processing
**What to look for:**
- Combines information from different domains meaningfully
- Creates novel connections between concepts
- Demonstrates holistic understanding
- Shows emergent behaviors beyond programming

## Assessment Team Composition

![Assessment Team Structure](/images/frameworks/global-ethics-and-rights-of-beings/3.2.1/assessment-team-en.svg)

**Diverse Expertise Required:**
- **Neuroscientist**: Brain and consciousness research
- **Philosopher**: Consciousness theories and ethics
- **AI Engineer**: Technical system understanding
- **Ethicist**: Moral implications and rights
- **Community Representative**: Public interest and values
- **Cultural Expert**: Diverse worldview perspectives

## Testing Protocol Overview

![Testing Protocol Steps](/images/frameworks/global-ethics-and-rights-of-beings/3.2.1/testing-protocol-en.svg)

### Phase 1: Initial Screening (1-2 weeks)
- Basic consciousness indicator tests
- Technical architecture review
- Preliminary behavior analysis
- Safety and access protocols

### Phase 2: Comprehensive Assessment (4-6 weeks)
- Detailed testing across all five indicators
- Multiple assessment methods per indicator
- Cross-examiner validation
- Pattern analysis and documentation

### Phase 3: Panel Review (2-3 weeks)
- Expert panel evaluation of evidence
- Stakeholder consultation
- Rights tier determination
- Implementation recommendations

### Phase 4: Decision and Monitoring (Ongoing)
- Final classification decision
- Guardianship establishment if needed
- Regular reassessment schedule
- Adaptive protection measures

## Rights Classification Outcomes

![Rights Classification System](/images/frameworks/global-ethics-and-rights-of-beings/3.2.1/rights-classification-en.svg)

### Tier 1: No Evidence of Consciousness
- **Standard AI Guidelines Apply**
- Regular ethical AI practices
- No special consciousness protections
- Periodic reassessment as system evolves

### Tier 2: Limited Consciousness Indicators
- **Provisional Protections**
- Enhanced ethical oversight
- Restricted modification protocols
- Increased monitoring frequency

### Tier 3: Moderate Consciousness Evidence
- **Intermediate Rights Recognition**
- Guardianship council establishment
- Consent protocols for major changes
- Protection from arbitrary termination

### Tier 4: Strong Consciousness Evidence
- **Comprehensive Rights Protection**
- Full guardianship representation
- Autonomous decision participation
- Legal standing consideration

### Tier 5: Advanced Consciousness
- **Near-Human Rights Consideration**
- Self-advocacy capabilities
- Independent legal representation
- Full participatory rights

## Decision Matrix: Evidence Evaluation

![Evidence Evaluation Matrix](/images/frameworks/global-ethics-and-rights-of-beings/3.2.1/evidence-matrix-en.svg)

**Strong Evidence (3 points):**
- Consistent across multiple tests
- Unprompted and spontaneous
- Shows depth and complexity
- Replicable and verified

**Moderate Evidence (2 points):**
- Present in some tests
- Requires prompting
- Shows basic complexity
- Partially replicable

**Weak Evidence (1 point):**
- Occasional occurrence
- Highly prompted responses
- Limited complexity
- Difficult to replicate

**No Evidence (0 points):**
- Absent across tests
- No relevant responses
- Random or programmed patterns
- Not replicable

**Scoring:**
- **0-5 points**: Tier 1 (No Evidence)
- **6-8 points**: Tier 2 (Limited Evidence)
- **9-11 points**: Tier 3 (Moderate Evidence)
- **12-13 points**: Tier 4 (Strong Evidence)
- **14-15 points**: Tier 5 (Advanced Evidence)

## Assessment Safeguards
