## 3.3.1 Moon Wish Test Operational Guidelines

The Moon Wish Test provides a rigorous methodology for assessing the ethical implications of human interventions on celestial bodies, applying the framework's principles to extraterrestrial contexts. This approach balances scientific exploration and resource utilization with preservation of pristine environments and respect for diverse cultural values.

### Objective

To establish a standardized, comprehensive methodology for evaluating human impacts on celestial bodies that balances scientific advancement with ethical considerations and preservation of future options.

### Tiered Assessment Approach

The framework implements a graduated assessment process scaled to the potential impact of the proposed intervention:

- **Pre-screening Checklist**:
- 10-point questionnaire for minimal-impact interventions (e.g., passive observation)
- Self-certification with spot audits for qualifying projects
- 72-hour review timeline for minimal interventions

- **Rapid Assessment Protocol**: Streamlined 30-day evaluation for minor interventions (e.g., small satellites, temporary installations)

- **Standard Assessment**: Full evaluation for medium-impact projects (e.g., resource surveys, limited extraction)

- **Comprehensive Assessment**: Extended process for major interventions (e.g., terraforming, permanent settlements)

### Quantifiable Criteria

#### 1. Cultural Heritage Assessment
- Structured survey of cultural significance across minimum 50 distinct cultural traditions
- Standardized scoring system (1-10) for interference with cultural narratives
- Minimum threshold: `<`3.0 average impact score to proceed

#### 2. Ecological Precaution Protocol
- Independent scientific panel review using standardized risk assessment matrix
- Burden of proof on proposing entity to demonstrate:
- Reversibility of all major alterations
- Containment of unintended consequences
- Preservation of 80% of original state

#### 3. Future Value Assessment
- Quantified modeling of scientific, aesthetic, and cultural value preservation
- Multi-generational impact projections using standardized discount rates
- Value plurality assessment (ensuring diverse human values are considered)

### Implementation Mechanism

- Standardized application process with public transparency
- Mandatory waiting period (scaled by intervention impact: 3-365 days)
- Appeal process with independent review panel
- Regular reassessment of approved interventions (5-year intervals)

### Enhanced Verification Mechanism

- Mandatory third-party review for any intervention affecting pristine environments
- **Risk-Based Audit Prioritization**:
- Environmental sensitivity scoring matrix (1-10) determining audit frequency
- Mandatory 100% audit rate for high-risk projects (score 8-10)
- 50% random audit rate for medium-risk projects (score 4-7)
- 25% random audit rate for low-risk projects (score 1-3)
- Additional trigger-based audits for projects with environmental anomalies

- **Peak Demand Contingency Plan**:
- Certified third-party auditor network activated during high-volume periods
- **Auditor Development Pipeline**:
- Partnership program with academic institutions to train specialized auditors
- Certification curriculum for environmental impact assessment
- Rotating apprenticeship program ensuring consistent expertise development
- Global auditor database with expertise mapping and availability tracking
- Pre-approved auditor qualifications and methodological training
- Queue prioritization system for time-sensitive projects
- Cross-regional auditor sharing during regional demand spikes
- Virtual audit capabilities for qualifying projects to expand capacity

- Quarterly public disclosure of all pre-screened approvals
- "Look-back" reviews comparing predicted vs. actual impacts
- Automatic escalation to Rapid Assessment if spot audit reveals discrepancies

- **Global Auditor Certification Standard**:
- Unified curriculum requirements across all training institutions
- Standardized competency examination with practical case assessments
- Centralized certification registry with public verification system
- Mandatory continuing education requirements (40 hours annually)
- Cross-regional calibration exercises ensuring assessment consistency
- Periodic recertification (3-year cycle) with updated methodologies

The Moon Wish Test represents the framework's application to celestial environments, recognizing that human activities beyond Earth require the same ethical consideration as those on our home planet. By implementing these guidelines, the framework extends rights considerations to celestial bodies, acknowledging their value for present and future generations across cultural perspectives.
