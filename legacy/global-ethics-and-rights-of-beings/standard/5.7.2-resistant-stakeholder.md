## 5.7.2 Resistant Stakeholder Engagement Strategy

Meaningful implementation of the Global Ethics & Rights of Beings Framework requires effective engagement with stakeholders who may initially resist its principles or applications. This section establishes comprehensive approaches for building productive relationships with resistant stakeholders while maintaining framework integrity.

### Resistance-Type Specific Engagement

*Those who perceive the framework as challenging their fundamental identity or values*

- **Identity Affirmation Approach**: Explicit acknowledgment of positive identity aspects
- **Values-Bridge Construction**: Connection between stakeholder values and framework principles
