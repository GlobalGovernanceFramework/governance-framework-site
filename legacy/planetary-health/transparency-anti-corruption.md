**Framework Position Within the Golden Triangle**: The transparency and anti-corruption framework operates as the accountability bridge between Treaty enforcement mechanisms, Indigenous justice systems, and meta-governance coordination oversight. Operating through the Global Enforcement Mechanism Health Division's prosecution authority and Traditional accountability methods, this framework demonstrates how Indigenous transparency traditions, Treaty institutional power, and coordinated global oversight converge to address corruption in planetary health systems through Traditional Knowledge protection, community sovereignty, and bioregional accountability that serves justice rather than institutional protection.

The Planetary Health Accord recognizes that corruption in healthcare systems diverts resources from Indigenous communities and undermines Traditional Knowledge sovereignty while extracting wealth from the most vulnerable populations. This comprehensive transparency framework combines Traditional accountability methods with Treaty enforcement capabilities and meta-governance oversight to ensure that health resources serve Traditional healing systems, Indigenous sovereignty, and community-controlled development rather than private enrichment or institutional corruption. All anti-corruption mechanisms prioritize Indigenous authority, Traditional Knowledge protection, and community sovereignty while providing protection for those who speak truth about healthcare system failures.

**Revolutionary Accountability Principles**: Indigenous accountability systems demonstrate that effective anti-corruption emerges from Traditional justice methods, Elder wisdom oversight, and community-controlled transparency that prioritizes relationship accountability and Traditional values over bureaucratic compliance. This framework operationalizes Traditional accountability as primary oversight while using Treaty enforcement mechanisms to prosecute corruption that affects Indigenous communities and Traditional Knowledge systems.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Truth and Reconciliation Commission of Canada Health Accountability** demonstrates Traditional accountability methods in health system oversight. The TRC's health-related Calls to Action specifically address accountability for Indigenous health through Traditional justice principles, requiring recognition of Indigenous healing practices and Traditional Knowledge while establishing accountability mechanisms for ongoing colonial health system failures. The Commission's approach integrates Traditional justice methods with modern accountability while maintaining Indigenous authority over evaluation and cultural safety protocols.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Pacific Islands Traditional Accountability Health Network** (2027-2032) successfully integrated Traditional accountability methods with modern transparency systems across 15 Pacific Island nations. Traditional consensus methods guided health system accountability while Global Enforcement Mechanism Health Division prosecuted pharmaceutical biopiracy affecting Traditional medicine. Indigenous accountability ceremonies replaced bureaucratic audits, achieving 95% community satisfaction with health system transparency while strengthening Traditional governance and preserving Traditional Knowledge sovereignty. The network demonstrated how Traditional accountability methods could provide more effective oversight than colonial audit systems while maintaining cultural protocol compliance and community authority.
