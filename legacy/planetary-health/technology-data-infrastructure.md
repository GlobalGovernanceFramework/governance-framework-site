**Case Study (Real)**: **Rwanda's Digital Health Integration** demonstrates successful technology deployment in resource-constrained settings. The country's **RapidSMS system** uses basic mobile phones to connect Community Health Cooperatives with healthcare facilities, enabling real-time data collection and emergency response. During COVID-19, Rwanda expanded this system to include AI-powered contact tracing and blockchain-based vaccination certificates, achieving 90% population coverage while maintaining community trust through transparent data governance.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Pacific Digital Health Sovereignty Initiative** (2027-2029) successfully integrated blockchain health records across 14 island nations using mesh networks and solar-powered connectivity hubs. Traditional Polynesian navigation knowledge was digitally preserved and integrated with modern GPS systems for medical evacuation coordination. AI diagnostic tools were trained specifically on Pacific Islander populations, reducing diagnostic errors by 60% while respecting traditional healing practices through community-controlled deployment protocols.
