# Contributing to the Global Governance Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Global Governance Framework project! This document outlines how to contribute effectively, including general guidelines and specific recommendations for leveraging AI tools to enhance your work.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a Feature Branch**: Use a descriptive branch name, e.g., `git checkout -b feature/add-new-component`.
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your feature or fix, adhering to the project’s coding style and structure (see [README.md](README.md) for details on the tech stack).
4. **Test Locally**: Run `npm run dev` to test your changes in the development environment.
5. **Commit Changes**: Write clear, concise commit messages, e.g., `git commit -m 'Add support for new language in i18n'`.
6. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your branch to your fork, e.g., `git push origin feature/add-new-component`.
7. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a PR against the main repository, describing your changes and their purpose.

## Using AI Tools in Contributions

AI can be a powerful ally in developing and refining the Global Governance Framework. Below are some recommendations for using specific AI tools, based on their observed strengths. Note that these suggestions are based on general observations and not on human developer experience within this project—use them as inspiration, but validate outputs against project needs and real-world testing.

### Claude
- **Strength**: Reliable and precise for translations, especially for technical content, and serves as an excellent main workhorse for development tasks.
- **Recommended Use**: Leverage Claude for updating or expanding the internationalization files in `src/lib/i18n/[language-code]/`, where its precision ensures consistency across languages. Additionally, the professional version’s project feature makes it ideal for maintaining a comprehensive knowledge base—keeping all frameworks, website content, and related materials in one place. This enables Claude to stay optimally context-aware when developing new ideas, revising website content, or refining governance frameworks.
- **Best Practice**: Cross-check translations with native speakers where possible, and commit changes with clear notes (e.g., "Translated via Claude, awaiting review"). For project feature users, regularly update the knowledge base with new framework drafts or content revisions to maximize Claude’s contextual understanding. Iterate using reviews by DeepSeek, ChatGPT and Grok and implement the suggestions with Claude.

### DeepSeek
- **Strength**: Highly creative at reviewing governance frameworks and suggesting complementary ideas, tools, and enhancements.
- **Recommended Use**: Use DeepSeek to brainstorm additional features, patterns, or interoperability mechanisms. For example, ask it to propose new tools or frameworks that could integrate with the project’s vision.
- **Best Practice**: Document all DeepSeek responses in the `/docs` folder (e.g., `/docs/ai-suggestions/deepseek-ideas.md`) for future reference, even if not immediately implemented. This builds a knowledge base for the community. 

### ChatGPT
- **Strength**: Versatile and good at providing complementary translations or rephrasing content for clarity.
- **Recommended Use**: Use ChatGPT to refine language in documentation, UI text, or as a secondary tool for translations when Claude isn’t available. It can also assist with generating draft content for blog posts or framework descriptions.
- **Best Practice**: Pair its outputs with Claude for technical accuracy or human review for tone and style.

### Grok (xAI)
- **Strength**: Excels at analyzing and summarizing complex information from diverse sources, such as web content, uploaded documents, or community discussions.
- **Recommended Use**: Use Grok to research governance models, distill insights from academic papers or online resources, or summarize project-related content to inform framework development. It’s also useful for reviewing project documentation and suggesting improvements.
- **Best Practice**: When using Grok for research, cite the original sources it draws from and store summaries in `/docs/research/`.

### General AI Usage Tips
- **Experimentation**: Feel free to experiment with other AI tools and share your findings in PRs or issues—new insights are valuable!
- **Caution**: AI outputs are suggestions, not authoritative solutions. Always review and adapt them to fit the project’s goals, codebase, and community standards.
- **Documentation**: If AI generates significant content (e.g., code, text, or ideas), note its origin in comments or commit messages (e.g., "Generated by DeepSeek, adapted by [your-name]").

## How the initial frameworks have been developed, an instruction manual

- Start with a request to Grok to draft an outline for the framework.
- Follow up with iterating between ChatGPT, DeepSeek and Claude, prompting something like this:
  "Hi ChatGPT/DeepSeek/Claude! Can you review and grade our framework outline (1-100/F-A++) over various areas and overall, as well as come with suggestions for enhancements?"
- Include the latest outline from Grok.
- After each iteration, prompt Grok with the reply from the other A.Is like this:
  "We have received a review from ChatGPT/DeepSeek/Claude. Can you enhance our outline by implementing all the suggestions?"
- Include a file or paste the suggestions from the review along with the prompt.
- As the framework outline matures, an index file can be created along with the framework outline, with the framework purpose, index and tools.
- When reaching 100/100 (A++) in one or several of the reviews, the frameworks can begin to be drafted fully, section by section, by either Claude or Grok. Grok have been observed to skip details in the framework outline, so be careful. The drafted sections can also be reviewed for improvements by the A.I. models.

Examples of this iterative method can be seens in '/docs/Implementation Framework Reviews'

## Code Style and Standards
- Follow the existing structure in `src/` (e.g., components in `lib/components/`, routes in `routes/`).
- Use Tailwind CSS classes consistently with the setup in `tailwind.config.js`.
- Ensure all translation keys are updated across all languages in `src/lib/i18n/`.

## Documentation Style Guide
All framework documentation should follow our [STYLE_GUIDE.md](STYLE_GUIDE.md) to ensure consistency across the project. This includes guidelines for:
- Document structure and organization
- Content formatting and terminology
- Visual elements and diagrams
- Multilingual support

Please review this guide before contributing new documentation or updating existing frameworks.
