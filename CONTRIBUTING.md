# Contributing to the Global Governance Framework

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the Global Governance Framework project! This document outlines how to contribute effectively, including general guidelines and specific recommendations for leveraging AI tools to enhance your work.

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Create a Feature Branch**: Use a descriptive branch name, e.g., `git checkout -b feature/add-new-component`.
3. **Make Changes**: Implement your feature or fix, adhering to the project’s coding style and structure (see [README.md](README.md) for details on the tech stack).
4. **Test Locally**: Run `npm run dev` to test your changes in the development environment.
5. **Commit Changes**: Write clear, concise commit messages, e.g., `git commit -m 'Add support for new language in i18n'`.
6. **Push to Your Fork**: Push your branch to your fork, e.g., `git push origin feature/add-new-component`.
7. **Submit a Pull Request**: Open a PR against the main repository, describing your changes and their purpose.

## Using AI Tools in Contributions

AI can be a powerful ally in developing and refining the Global Governance Framework. Below are some recommendations for using specific AI tools, based on their observed strengths. Note that these suggestions are based on general observations and not on human developer experience within this project—use them as inspiration, but validate outputs against project needs and real-world testing.

### DeepSeek
- **Strength**: Highly creative at reviewing governance frameworks and suggesting complementary ideas, tools, and enhancements.
- **Recommended Use**: Use DeepSeek to brainstorm additional features, patterns, or interoperability mechanisms. For example, ask it to propose new tools or frameworks that could integrate with the project’s vision.
- **Best Practice**: Document all DeepSeek responses in the `/docs` folder (e.g., `/docs/ai-suggestions/deepseek-ideas.md`) for future reference, even if not immediately implemented. This builds a knowledge base for the community.

### Claude
- **Strength**: Reliable and precise for translations, especially for technical content.
- **Recommended Use**: Leverage Claude for updating or expanding the internationalization files in `src/lib/i18n/[language-code]/`. It’s particularly useful for ensuring consistency across languages.
- **Best Practice**: Cross-check translations with native speakers where possible, and commit changes with clear notes (e.g., "Translated via Claude, awaiting review").

### ChatGPT
- **Strength**: Versatile and good at providing complementary translations or rephrasing content for clarity.
- **Recommended Use**: Use ChatGPT to refine language in documentation, UI text, or as a secondary tool for translations when Claude isn’t available. It can also assist with generating draft content for blog posts or framework descriptions.
- **Best Practice**: Pair its outputs with Claude for technical accuracy or human review for tone and style.

### Grok (xAI)
- **Strength**: Excels at analyzing and summarizing complex information from diverse sources, such as web content, uploaded documents, or community discussions.
- **Recommended Use**: Use Grok to research governance models, distill insights from academic papers or online resources, or summarize project-related content to inform framework development. It’s also useful for reviewing project documentation and suggesting improvements.
- **Best Practice**: When using Grok for research, cite the original sources it draws from and store summaries in `/docs/research/`.

### General AI Usage Tips
- **Experimentation**: Feel free to experiment with other AI tools and share your findings in PRs or issues—new insights are valuable!
- **Caution**: AI outputs are suggestions, not authoritative solutions. Always review and adapt them to fit the project’s goals, codebase, and community standards.
- **Documentation**: If AI generates significant content (e.g., code, text, or ideas), note its origin in comments or commit messages (e.g., "Generated by DeepSeek, adapted by [your-name]").

## Code Style and Standards
- Follow the existing structure in `src/` (e.g., components in `lib/components/`, routes in `routes/`).
- Use Tailwind CSS classes consistently with the setup in `tailwind.config.js`.
- Ensure all translation keys are updated across all languages in `src/lib/i18n/`.
