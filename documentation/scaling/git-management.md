Bj√∂rn:
For a project of this magnitude, won't I get bogged down in reviews on committed branches? 

Gemini:
This is an excellent and crucial question. You've hit on one of the most critical challenges of scaling any project, especially one of this magnitude: the "benevolent dictator" bottleneck. Your concern is not just valid; it's a sign of a good project leader thinking about future sustainability.

The short answer is: **Yes, you absolutely would get bogged down if you remained the sole reviewer.** Therefore, the goal is to design a system where you don't have to be.

The GGF's own principles provide the solution. We will apply **Polycentric Coordination** and **Fractal Governance** to the review process itself. Here is a phased approach for how to think about this, from your current situation to a thriving community.

### Phase 1: The Solo Stage (Right Now)

In this initial phase, while you are the primary contributor, the purpose of the Git workflow is different.

* **Your Own Branches:** When you work on your own branches, the "Pull Request" (PR) is not for review, but for **documentation and process practice**. You are creating a clean, public log of the work. You should **merge your own PRs** after a quick self-check. Don't spend time formally reviewing your own work; the goal is to build the history and practice the habit.
* **The First Contributor (Emil):** When Emil (or someone else) makes their first PR, **you will review it.** This is your first opportunity to mentor and test the process. This won't bog you down; it will be a high-leverage use of your time to onboard a new collaborator.

### Phase 2: The Small Team Stage (2-5 Core Contributors)

Once you have a few people actively contributing, you introduce the principle of **Distributed Responsibility**. You are no longer the only reviewer.

* **Introduce "Lab Stewards":** Each of the four labs (Frameworks, Ecosystem, Translations, Tech) should have a "steward" or "lead". This might still be you for most of them initially, but as soon as someone shows aptitude (e.g., Emil in the Translations Lab), you deputize them.
* **The "Two-Person Rule":** No one merges their own pull request. Any PR requires approval from **at least one other person**, preferably the steward of that lab. This distributes the load immediately. You review the translation work from Emil; Emil can review a documentation change from you.
* **Use GitHub's Tools:** Implement a `CODEOWNERS` file in your GitHub repository. This is a simple text file that automatically requests a review from the designated "owner" of a particular file or directory. For example:
    * Any changes in the `/frameworks/` directory automatically request a review from you.
    * Any changes in the `/translations/sv/` directory automatically request a review from Emil.

### Phase 3: The Community Stage (5+ Contributors)

As the project grows, you introduce more automation and clear governance to prevent you from ever becoming a bottleneck.

* **Automated Checks (CI/CD):** You can set up free GitHub Actions that automatically check every PR for basic errors. This is your "robot reviewer" that handles the simple stuff.
    * **For Documents:** Does the markdown have formatting errors? Are all links working? Is there a spell-check?
    * **For Code:** Does the code run without errors? Does it meet basic style guidelines?
* **Tiered Permissions:** Your community will naturally develop layers. You can reflect this in GitHub permissions.
    * **Contributors:** Anyone can create an issue and submit a pull request.
    * **Maintainers / Stewards:** A smaller group of trusted, active contributors who have the power to approve PRs and merge them into the `main` branch.
* **Lab Autonomy:** Each Lab becomes a self-governing "poly-center". The Tech Lab manages its own code reviews, and the Frameworks Lab manages its own text reviews. You, as the project catalyst, only need to intervene on major, cross-lab architectural decisions, not on every single typo fix.

### Summary of the Strategy

| **Project Stage** | **Your Role** | **Review Strategy** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Solo** | Architect | **Self-Merge:** PRs are for documentation, not approval. |
| **Small Team** | Mentor / Catalyst | **Peer Review:** Implement the "Two-Person Rule". Deputize "Lab Stewards". |
| **Community** | Orchestrator | **Automated + Steward Review:** Use automated checks for basics. Lab Stewards handle final approval. |

You are right to be thinking about this now. By designing the review process with these phases in mind, you ensure that as the project grows, the responsibility gracefully distributes itself, freeing you up to focus on the high-level vision and orchestration, rather than being buried in day-to-day approvals.
