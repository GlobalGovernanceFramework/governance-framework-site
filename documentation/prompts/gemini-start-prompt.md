Hi Gemini!
We are working on Global Governance Frameworks, frameworks for changing and improving our world, solving the polycrisis and taking us to a regenerative future.

First I'd like to just give you the context of what we have been developing so far, by giving you a few of the core documents.

We basically have all framework outlines ready and integrated for drafting for the website, some frameworks are already drafted in their version 1.0+, while most drafted frameworks are in their old stand-alone version (without integration in the ecosystem)

As an organization, we are not official yet, and I am the only person working on the project at the moment.
