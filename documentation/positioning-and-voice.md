# Framework Development & Positioning Guidelines

## Framework Authority & Development Positioning

All Global Governance Framework documentation must accurately represent the development methodology and authority level while maintaining appropriate confidence in the substantive research and analysis contained within each framework.

### Development Methodology Description

**Standard Language for Framework Development**:
Use consistent language across all frameworks to describe the development approach:

```markdown
**Framework Development**: This [framework/guide/toolkit] is part of the Global Governance Framework initiative, developed through iterative refinement using multiple AI systems (Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Grok, and Gemini) to achieve comprehensive research synthesis and maximize diversity of analytical perspectives.

**Research Foundation**: The framework integrates evidence-based practices, international best practices, and established [domain-specific] principles while [specific focus area, e.g., "honoring diverse cultural approaches" or "prioritizing community sovereignty"].
```

### **Tone of Voice**
Our voice is authoritative yet accessible; balancing technical precision with clarity. It should always be:

- **Visionary yet Grounded:** We balance profound, long-term vision with practical, actionable steps.
- **Hopeful but Realistic:** We acknowledge the scale of the world's challenges while maintaining a core belief in humanity's potential to solve them.
- **Collaborative and Inclusive:** We use "we" and "our" to reflect the collaborative nature of the project.

The tone should always reflect our core philosophy. Key themes to weave into our writing include:

- **Right Relationship:** The central concept of interconnected, regenerative systems.
- **Flourishing:** Our goal is not just sustainability or survival, but the flourishing of all life.
- **Indigenous-Guided:** We explicitly state that our work is guided by and defers to Indigenous wisdom and sovereignty.
- **Human-AI Collaboration:** We are open about our development process, positioning it as a strength that ensures rigor and multi-perspective analysis.

### Authority Level Positioning

**Appropriate Confidence Level**:
- **Acknowledge Individual Development**: Be transparent that frameworks are developed by an individual researcher
- **Emphasize Research Rigor**: Highlight the iterative AI refinement process and evidence integration
- **Maintain Intellectual Humility**: Include appropriate caveats about local adaptation needs
- **Assert Substantive Value**: Present frameworks as serious contributions based on comprehensive analysis

**Avoid**:
- Overly institutional language that implies organizational authority not yet established
- Excessive disclaimers that undermine the substantial research foundation
- Claims of operational programs or services not yet available
- False modesty that diminishes legitimate research contributions

### Context-Specific Applications

**For Framework Overviews and Major Documents**:
```markdown
**Development Note**: This framework represents comprehensive research synthesis developed through iterative refinement using multiple AI systems, integrating evidence-based practices with [domain-specific approaches]. While developed by an individual researcher, the framework draws from established [relevant field] principles and international best practices.

**Implementation Guidance**: The framework provides research-based guidance for [specific application]. Local implementation should involve consultation with [relevant stakeholders] familiar with specific contexts and requirements.
```

**For Implementation Tools and Practical Guides**:
```markdown
**Framework Foundation**: This [tool/guide] is part of the [Framework Name], developed through iterative research synthesis and AI-assisted analysis to integrate best practices with [specific focus].

**Local Adaptation**: While grounded in research and established practices, implementation should involve consultation with [relevant local experts] familiar with specific cultural, legal, and contextual requirements.
```

**For Conceptual or Theoretical Sections**:
```markdown
**Research Approach**: This analysis represents comprehensive research synthesis developed through iterative refinement across multiple AI systems to maximize analytical diversity and evidence integration.

**Theoretical Framework**: While conceptual, this framework draws from established [relevant field] research and international best practices in [specific area].
```

### Stakeholder Engagement Language

**When Describing Consultation Needs**:
- Use "should involve consultation with" rather than "requires validation by"
- Specify relevant stakeholder types (e.g., "mental health professionals," "community leaders," "traditional healers")
- Emphasize collaboration rather than subordination to external authority
- Maintain framework integrity while acknowledging local expertise needs

**When Describing Implementation Support**:
- Be honest about current capacity and availability
- Use development status indicators (âœ… Currently Available, ðŸš§ In Development)
- Provide clear contact information and realistic response expectations
- Avoid promising services or support not yet operational

### Research Citation and Evidence Base

**When Referencing Research**:
- Distinguish between real case studies (documented implementations) and conceptual examples (illustrative scenarios)
- Use **(Real)** and **(Conceptual)** indicators for case studies
- Cite specific research when available while acknowledging synthesis nature of framework development
- Present evidence integration as strength rather than limitation

**Research Synthesis Language**:
```markdown
This framework integrates research findings from [specific sources when available] with analysis across multiple domains to provide comprehensive guidance for [specific application]. The iterative development process across multiple AI systems ensures diverse analytical perspectives and comprehensive evidence consideration.
```

### Quality and Rigor Indicators

**Emphasize Analytical Rigor**:
- Highlight the iterative refinement process as quality assurance
- Note the multi-AI approach as ensuring diverse perspectives
- Emphasize evidence integration and synthesis methodology
- Present comprehensive scope as analytical strength

**Acknowledge Limitations Appropriately**:
- Note individual development while emphasizing research foundation
- Include local adaptation needs without undermining framework value
- Acknowledge evolving nature of frameworks while maintaining current utility
- Balance humility with confidence in substantive contributions

### Consistency Across Frameworks

**Maintain Parallel Structure**:
- Use similar positioning language across all frameworks
- Adapt stakeholder consultation language to domain-specific needs
- Maintain consistent tone and authority level across documents
- Ensure development status transparency across all materials

**Domain-Specific Adaptations**:
- **Mental Health**: Emphasize lived experience integration and cultural competency needs
- **Environmental**: Highlight indigenous knowledge and local ecological expertise
- **Economic**: Note policy and implementation complexity requiring local adaptation
- **Technology**: Emphasize community sovereignty and digital rights considerations

### Version Control and Updates

**Framework Evolution Language**:
```markdown
**Living Document Status**: This framework is designed for continuous improvement based on implementation experience and emerging research. Current version represents comprehensive analysis as of [date] with regular updates planned based on feedback and new developments.
```

**Update Protocols**:
- Include version numbers and dates for major updates
- Maintain changelog for significant modifications
- Preserve core positioning language across versions
- Update development status indicators as capacity grows

## Implementation Checklist

When creating new framework documents, ensure:

- [ ] Appropriate development methodology description included
- [ ] Authority level accurately represented (neither overstated nor understated)
- [ ] Local adaptation needs specified without undermining framework value
- [ ] Current capacity honestly represented with development status indicators
- [ ] Research foundation emphasized while acknowledging individual development
- [ ] Domain-specific stakeholder consultation needs clearly specified
- [ ] Contact information realistic and currently available
- [ ] Consistent tone and positioning with other framework documents

## Examples of Effective Positioning

**Strong Positioning (Recommended)**:
> "This framework represents comprehensive research synthesis developed through iterative refinement using multiple AI systems, integrating evidence-based practices with community-led approaches. While developed by an individual researcher, the framework draws from established mental health principles and international best practices."

**Weak Positioning (Avoid)**:
> "This is just a theoretical framework developed by one person and should not be taken seriously without extensive professional validation."

**Overstated Positioning (Avoid)**:
> "This framework represents the definitive approach to global mental health governance, developed by our comprehensive research team with extensive operational experience."

**Balanced Positioning (Recommended)**:
> "The framework provides research-based guidance for community mental health transformation. Local implementation should involve consultation with mental health professionals, community leaders, and traditional healers familiar with specific cultural and legal contexts."

This positioning approach maintains intellectual honesty while asserting the legitimate value of comprehensive research synthesis and multi-perspective analytical development.

**IMPORTANT**: Save the framework positioning for the end where it provides helpful context without interrupting the main content flow to avoid reader fatigue.
