### üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Notes (should only be changed if extremely necessary)

* **SvelteKit routing** for modular page sections or subroutes
* **Markdown** for values, practices, rituals, and glossary (easy content updates)
* **LocalStorage** for saved rituals, story drafts, assessment scores
* **SVG or Canvas animations** for ripple/movement/globe
* **Translation-ready** (start with English/Swedish via JSON)
* **Accessibility focus**: tabbing, alt text, readable contrast

---

### üéØ First Review Round Goals

Each AI reviewer (Grok, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, me) can now:

* **Grade** this v0 architecture (1‚Äì100 or F‚ÄìA++)
* **Suggest** refinements in structure, naming, flow, or components
* **Highlight** missing features or alignment mismatches with your broader vision

---

### üåÄ Optional Names for the New Experience

* **The Global Citizenship Journey**
* **Awaken the Citizen Within**
* **We Are One: Live It**
* **The Ripple Begins With You**
* **From Local to Planetary**

---

Would you like me to now write the **hero section draft** in Markdown + Svelte component format, or do you want to let Grok take this architecture draft and begin implementation first?
