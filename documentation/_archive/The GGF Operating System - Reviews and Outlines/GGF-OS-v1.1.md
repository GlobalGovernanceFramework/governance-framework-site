# GGF Operating System (GGF-OS v1.1)

This document is the constitution, manifesto, and operational guide for the Global Governance Framework (GGF). It is a public, living document, hosted on a Git repository, and subject to participatory revision processes. The GGF-OS embodies the principles it promotes, acting as a prototype for resilient, participatory governance.

## 0. Preamble: The Call & The Commitment

### The Polycrisis Imperative
Humanity faces interconnected global crises—climate change, inequality, conflict, and technological disruption—that demand coordinated, systemic responses. These challenges threaten the well-being of our planet and its inhabitants, requiring adaptive, inclusive governance grounded in shared stewardship.

### Our Response: A Guild of Stewards
The GGF exists to co-create, curate, and disseminate open-source governance frameworks for planetary well-being. We are a global network of contributors collaboratively designing systems that foster resilience, equity, and sustainability.

### Our Compass: Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI)
GGF’s success is measured by the flourishing of its members and the communities it serves, assessed through a holistic index: Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI).

### Our Foundation: Integrated Consciousness
Our work integrates healthy expressions of developmental stages, inspired by Spiral Dynamics:
- **Beige:** Ensuring physical security and survival needs.
- **Purple:** Fostering community belonging and cultural cohesion.
- **Red:** Encouraging bold action and individual agency.
- **Blue:** Upholding shared values and disciplined execution.
- **Orange:** Driving innovation and strategic effectiveness.
- **Green:** Promoting inclusivity and empathy.
- **Yellow/Turquoise:** Embracing systemic, holistic integration.

## 1. Core Principles

These principles guide GGF’s internal operations.

### Radical Transparency
All non-private operational data—finances, decision logs, and project roadmaps—are publicly accessible via platforms like OpenCollective.

### Subsidiarity & Polycentrism
GGF is a modular network of autonomous Working Groups (Labs). Decision-making is localized to Labs for their domains, with a Stewards Circle coordinating essential network-wide functions.

### Direct & Deliberative Participation
All members have a voice. Decision-making uses a tiered model:
- **Consensus** for charter amendments.
- **Consent** for operational decisions.
- **Individual autonomy** for personal tasks.
Digital tools like Loomio and Pol.is enable scalable deliberation.

### Epistemic Humility & Open Inquiry
We foster curiosity over certainty. An internal “Office of the Adversary” challenges assumptions, and all work is versioned (e.g., v1.1) to encourage iteration.

### Ethical Tooling
We prioritize open-source, privacy-respecting, and decentralized tools. Proprietary tools are used consciously, with clear exit strategies.

### Graceful Obsolescence
GGF is a scaffold, not a monument. A “Sunset Protocol” defines conditions for dissolving or transitioning the organization when its mission is fulfilled.

## 2. Organizational Structure

GGF operates as a holarchy—a system of nested, autonomous units.

### A. Working Groups (Labs)
- **Purpose:** Core operational units aligned with GGF domains (e.g., Climate & Energy Lab, Peace & Conflict Lab, Digital Commons Lab).
- **Autonomy:** Labs manage their projects, budgets, and teams, adhering to the GGF-OS.
- **Operation:** Each Lab defines its internal processes but aligns with the Charter’s principles.

### B. Roles
- **Contributors:** Individuals contributing code, content, facilitation, or resources.
- **Lab Stewards:** One or two rotating coordinators per Lab, responsible for communication, Charter adherence, and project oversight.
- **Stewards Circle:** A small, rotating body of one steward per Lab, tasked with:
  1. Resource allocation.
  2. Cross-Lab coordination.
  3. Charter guardianship.
  4. External communications.
- **Support Guild:** A specialized Lab providing tools, infrastructure, and administrative support (e.g., legal, financial) to all Labs.
- **Founding Guardian:** The initial custodian of GGF’s principles, with a defined transition protocol (see Section 5).

---

## 3. Operational Protocols

### Code & Content Protocol
- **Repository:** All work is stored in a public Git repository (e.g., GitHub, GitLab).
- **Licensing:** Code uses permissive open-source licenses (e.g., MIT, Apache 2.0). Content uses Creative Commons (e.g., CC-BY-SA).
- **Versioning:** Frameworks and documents use semantic versioning (e.g., v1.1.0).

### Communication Protocol
- **Asynchronous-First:** Primary communication is text-based and asynchronous via platforms like Mattermost or Matrix.
- **Synchronous Gatherings:** Optional video calls for high-bandwidth discussions and in-person retreats in nature for strategic alignment.
- **Public Outreach:** GGF shares work through accessible media (e.g., YouTube, podcasts, interactive models).

### Financial Protocol
- **Funding:** Secured through grants, donations, and mechanisms like Reform Impact Bonds.
- **Treasury:** Funds are held in a transparent treasury (e.g., OpenCollective).
- **Allocation:** The Stewards Circle allocates budgets to Labs based on participatory proposals.

### Decision-Making Protocol
- **Tools:** Platforms like Loomio facilitate proposals and voting.
- **Process:** Proposals move from idea to discussion, vote, and implementation, inspired by sociocratic models.
- **Conflict Resolution:** Uses the “Spiral Peacecraft” model for internal disputes.

## 4. Dissolution (Sunset) Protocol

### Review Cycle
Every 3-5 years, GGF conducts a “Purpose Review” to assess its relevance.

### Sunset Criteria
The review evaluates:
- Have global systems integrated resilient, participatory governance, rendering GGF’s role non-essential?
- Are other networks more effectively advancing this mission?

### Dissolution Process
If dissolution is agreed upon:
- Financial assets are donated to an aligned foundation.
- Intellectual assets are archived in a decentralized public commons (e.g., Arweave).

## 5. Foundational Roles & Transition Protocols

### 5.1 Philosophy of Stewardship
GGF is a resilient, self-evolving ecosystem. All roles, including that of the original creator, are temporary and serve the organization’s principles and mission. The goal is to evolve from catalysis to custodianship, ensuring the organization thrives independently of any individual.

### 5.2 The Role of the Founding Guardian
The Founding Guardian is the initial custodian of GGF’s core principles, inspired by the “Council of Guardians” model.

- **Mandate:** To uphold the integrity of GGF’s principles without executive authority, acting as a guide and reflective voice.
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Pose questions during key decisions to ensure alignment with the GGF-OS (e.g., “Does this align with radical transparency?”).
  - Serve as a “living historian,” providing context on the original intent of principles when requested.
  - Champion mechanisms like the Office of the Adversary to challenge groupthink.
- **Limitations:** The Founding Guardian cannot veto decisions by the Stewards Circle or Labs, allocate resources unilaterally, or direct projects.

### 5.3 Founder Transition Protocol
This protocol ensures the organization’s independence through a phased transition.

- **Phase 1: Catalyst (Years 1-2)**  
  The Founding Guardian plays a high-involvement role in establishing the organization, frameworks, and community, while actively building structures for decentralization.
- **Phase 2: Stewardship & Mentorship (Years 3-5)**  
  The Founding Guardian mentors other stewards, delegates all executive responsibilities, and reduces operational involvement. At least one extended sabbatical is taken to test organizational resilience.
- **Phase 3: Guardian Emeritus (Year 6+)**  
  The role becomes purely advisory, with no formal responsibilities. The community may consult the Guardian Emeritus, but GGF operates independently. This phase includes a clause for its eventual sunsetting, transferring full stewardship to the community.

## 6. Supporting Resources

### Culture Deck
A narrative-driven document illustrating the GGF experience, emphasizing LMCI and integrated consciousness in an accessible format.

### Onboarding Journey
An automated process introducing new contributors to the Charter, tools, and a Lab “buddy” for integration.

### Tools & Tech Stack
A living document detailing selected tools, their rationale, and alternatives, ensuring alignment with the Ethical Tooling principle.

This GGF Operating System is a pilot of the governance models we advocate. By embodying our principles and codifying the transition of foundational roles, GGF becomes a living demonstration of a regenerative, participatory future.
