# Technical Specification: Love Ledger & Community Consent App (v1.1 - Enhanced)

**Document Status:** Draft v1.1  
**Date:** July 14, 2025  
**Author:** GGF Catalyst - Frameworks Lab  
**Purpose:** This document provides the detailed technical and functional specifications for the GGF's first pilot application. It is intended for project stakeholders and the future development team, and it outlines a phased development roadmap.

---

## 1. Introduction & Vision

### 1.1. Project Goal

The "Love Ledger & Community Consent" application is the first Minimum Viable Product (MVP) of the Global Governance Frameworks' technical infrastructure. Its purpose is twofold:

1. **To be the engine for the GGF Catalyst's internal Hearts-based economy:** It will allow founding members to log contributions and validate the "Proof of Care" protocol, making our own organizational structure a living prototype of the systems we advocate for.

2. **To provide a tangible tool for community partners:** It will offer a practical, secure, and culturally sensitive way to implement **Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC 2.0)**, a cornerstone of the Indigenous Governance Framework.

This application is the first step in translating the GGF's core economic and ethical logic into a functional, real-world tool.

### 1.2. Target Users

The application will be designed for the following user roles:

- **Community Member:** Any individual participating in a community (or the GGF Catalyst itself) who wishes to log contributions or participate in consent decisions.
- **Community Weaver (Validator):** A trusted, trained facilitator responsible for validating contributions ("Proof of Care") and guiding consent processes.
- **Project Facilitator:** An individual (internal or external) who initiates a proposal that requires community consent.
- **BAZ/Community Admin:** An administrator for a specific Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) or community, responsible for managing members and local settings.
- **GGF Super Admin:** The GGF Catalyst team, responsible for overall system administration and managing the Heart-to-Fiat conversion bridge.

### 1.3. Core Concepts

- **Love Ledger:** A decentralized, transparent log of valuable contributions that are often invisible in the traditional economy (e.g., care work, ecological stewardship, knowledge sharing).
- **Hearts (♥):** The internal unit of account for recognizing social and cultural contributions logged on the Love Ledger.
- **Leaves (🍃):** A distinct unit for recognizing verified ecological contributions.
- **Proof of Care:** The protocol for validating contributions. In the MVP, this is based on peer attestation and validation by a designated Community Weaver.
- **FPIC 2.0 (Community Consent):** A process for seeking consent from a community for a proposed action, which respects the community's right to grant, withhold, or place conditions on their consent, including the right to veto.

### 1.4. Versioning & Feature Roadmap

This is a living document. The application will be developed in phases to manage complexity and ensure alignment with community needs.

- **v1.0 (MVP - Internal Pilot):** Focus on core Love Ledger functionality for the GGF Catalyst's internal economy. Simple consent module.
- **v1.5 (Partner Pilot):** Introduce enhanced FPIC 2.0 features, Leaves for ecological work, offline capabilities, and advanced Community Weaver tools.
- **v2.0 (Public Release):** Incorporate blockchain integration hooks, Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy, and deeper integration with other GGF frameworks like AUBI.

### 1.5. Guiding Design Principles

This application is a living embodiment of the GGF's core principles. Its design is guided by:

* **Radical Autonomy & Trust:** The self-attestation of contributions and peer-to-peer validation are built on a foundation of high trust, replacing hierarchical oversight.
* **Indigenous Sovereignty:** The FPIC 2.0 module is designed from the ground up to respect and empower community-led decision-making and the right to veto, as defined in the Indigenous Governance Framework.
* **Radical Transparency:** The public nature of the Love Ledger (within a community) ensures accountability and fosters a culture of shared understanding.
* **Liberatory Impermanence:** The phased rollout and modular design allow the tool to evolve, adapt, and even be gracefully retired if a community develops more natural coordination methods.

## 2. Functional Requirements (User Stories)

### 2.1. Core MVP (v1.0)

- **As a BAZ Admin, I want to** invite new members to our community hub via email or a secure link.
- **As a new Community Member, I want to** create a simple profile with my name and role.
- **As a Community Member, I want to** log a contribution via text, voice note, or photo, including a description, time spent, and type (e.g., "Care Work," "Knowledge Sharing").
- **As a Community Weaver, I want to** see a queue of pending contributions and approve or reject them with a comment.
- **As a Project Facilitator, I want to** create a simple "Consent Proposal" with a title, description, and a clear question.
- **As a Community Member, I want to** view a proposal and respond with "Consent," "Do Not Consent (Veto)," or "Consent with Conditions" (using a simple text field).

### 2.2. Future Versions (v1.5+)

- **As a Community Member, I want to** log an "Ecological Stewardship" contribution and have it be recognized with Leaves.
- **As a Community Weaver, I want to** use my dashboard to see community health metrics (e.g., participation rates).
- **As a Project Facilitator, I want to** create a consent proposal with a specific duration (e.g., "5-year permit") and track structured conditions.
- **As a Community Member, I want to** be able to formally withdraw my previously given consent for a project.
- **As a Community Member, I want to** access and use the application even when I am offline, with my contributions syncing automatically when I reconnect.

---

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1. Security & Data Sovereignty

- **v1.0:** All user data must be encrypted at rest and in transit.
- **v1.5+:** Implement community-controlled encryption keys and data residency options for Indigenous Data Sovereignty.
- **v2.0:** Explore Zero-Knowledge Proofs for privacy-preserving validation.

### 3.2. Accessibility & Localization

- **v1.0:** The interface must be simple and intuitive. It must support low-tech pathways (e.g., a Community Weaver logging on behalf of a member). The initial build will be in English and Swedish.
- **v1.5+:** Full ARIA support for screen readers, voice navigation, and specific accommodations for neurodiversity (e.g., high-contrast modes, reduced motion).

> **Design Principle: Servant to the Process**
> 
> The application must be a **servant to a community's governance process, not a replacement for it.** The primary function of the app is to *record* the outcome of a community's consent process, which may happen offline or ceremonially. The Community Weaver role is the crucial human bridge, and the app's features (multimedia uploads, flexible inputs, cultural protocol flags) must be designed to empower them to accurately log the results of these real-world processes.
> 
> **Implementation Notes:**
> - Prioritize **flexibility over rigidity** in UI design
> - Focus on **robust data capture** rather than prescriptive workflows
> - Build powerful tools for Community Weavers as the primary "API" between cultural processes and digital records
> - Avoid over-engineering attempts to digitize sacred ceremonies

### 3.3. Performance

- **v1.0:** The system must be responsive in low-bandwidth environments.
- **v1.5+:** Implement an "offline-first" architecture using Service Workers and local storage (IndexedDB) to ensure functionality without a constant internet connection.

## Conclusion

The Love Ledger & Community Consent App represents a crucial first step in making the GGF's vision tangible and actionable. By starting with our own internal economy and gradually expanding to partner communities, we can ensure the technology truly serves the values it's meant to embody.

The phased approach allows us to learn, adapt, and build trust while maintaining our commitment to Indigenous sovereignty, community self-determination, and regenerative relationships. Through careful attention to accessibility, security, and cultural sensitivity, this application can become a powerful tool for demonstrating that another way of organizing economic and social relationships is not only possible but practical.

**Next Steps:**

1. **Finalize v1.0 Spec for Technical Partnership:** Use this document to create a compelling "Call for a Technical Co-Founder/Partner" and to inform grant proposals for seed funding, as outlined in the Ecosystem Lab's strategic goals.
2. **Prototype the Internal Hearts Economy:** Begin the Phase 1 internal pilot using a simplified version of the v1.0 data model (e.g., a secure spreadsheet) to immediately start logging contributions and testing the Hearts-to-Fiat conversion process for the founding team.
3. **Initiate Community Weaver Program Design:** Begin drafting the training modules for Community Weavers, focusing on the skills needed for the v1.5 pilot (FPIC facilitation, cultural sensitivity).
4. **Identify Pilot Partners:** Based on the "First Partner Pilot" criteria, begin identifying and building relationships with potential BAZs or community organizations for the v1.5 rollout.
5. **Establish Oversight Protocols:** Formalize the community oversight and feedback mechanisms that will guide the app's evolution from v1.0 to v1.5 and beyond.
