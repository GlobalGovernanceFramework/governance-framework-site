### Guiding Principle: Quality Over Quantity

Your rule should be: **Post only when you have something substantial to say.** A sparse blog with thoughtful, significant posts is far more impressive than a busy blog with minor, rushed updates.

### Posting Frequency:

Aim for **once or twice a month, at most.**

Sometimes you might go six weeks without a post because you're deep in development, and that is perfectly fine. It's better to post nothing than to post fluff.

### What to Post: The 4 Pillars of Content

Think of your blog posts as announcements of significant milestones, not a daily diary. Here are the four types of posts you should focus on.

**1. Milestone Updates (Your idea is perfect here)**
This is for when a major chunk of work is completed.
* **Example Titles:**
    * "New Draft Available: A Framework for AI Futures Governance"
    * "Completed: The 2025 Frameworks Audit and Revision"
    * "Announcing New Interactive Tools for Economic Modeling"

**2. Strategic Updates & Calls to Action**
This is the most important category for you right now. Use the blog to amplify your most critical needs.
* **Example Titles:**
    * "Our Path to Formalization: Seeking Founding Board Members" (You can adapt the content from your static page into a more personal blog post).
    * "The Next Step: Why We're Registering as a Swedish 'Ideell FÃ¶rening'"
    * "Seeking Expertise: A Call for Advisors in Non-Profit Law"

**3. Founder's Insights (The "Why")**
These are shorter, more reflective posts where you explain the philosophy behind a key concept. This builds a personal connection and shows the depth of the project.
* **Example Titles:**
    * "Why 'Sovereignty Bargains' Are a Cornerstone of the Treaty"
    * "Beyond Bullet Points: My Approach to Refining the Frameworks"
    * "The Role of AI in an Ethical Governance Project"

**4. Progress Reports (Quarterly)**
A simple, high-level summary of what you've accomplished every 3 months. This is great for showing consistent momentum.
* **Example Title:**
    * "Project Update: Q3 2025 Progress Report"
    * *(Body: "This quarter, we fixed over 100 broken links, completed the audit of three core frameworks, and began the legal paperwork for our non-profit status...")*

By sticking to these four types of posts, you ensure that every blog entry is meaningful, supports your primary goals, and respects your limited time.
