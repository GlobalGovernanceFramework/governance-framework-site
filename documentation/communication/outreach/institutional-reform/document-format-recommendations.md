Bj√∂rn:
My question was related to the outreach. What format should I have the documents (md, odt, pdf?) 

Gemini:
My apologies, you are absolutely right. I misunderstood your question and focused on the content of the documents rather than the practical question of format for outreach. Thank you for the clarification.

Let's address the format question directly, keeping in mind your context: you are a solo founder preparing for initial, strategic outreach. The format you choose should match the audience and the goal of the communication.

Here is a clear recommendation for which formats to use for your documents:

### **1. For Initial "Friendly Expert" & Advisor Outreach:**

Your goal here is to get feedback, build allies, and make it easy for busy people to engage.

* **Primary Document:** **Executive Summary**
    * **Format:** **PDF (`.pdf`)**
    * **Why:** A PDF is professional, universal, and non-editable. It preserves your formatting perfectly across all devices and signals that this is a polished, well-considered document. It's the standard for formal attachments.

* **Supporting Documents:** **Seed Track MVP** & **Stakeholder Mapping Exercise**
    * **Format:** **PDF (`.pdf`)** for both.
    * **Why:** Attach these as separate, clean PDFs. This allows the reviewer to engage with the material they find most interesting without being overwhelmed by a single massive file. The HTML for the mapping exercise should be saved or printed as a PDF to ensure it's easily viewable.

* **How to Share:** In your email, attach the **Executive Summary PDF directly**. Then, provide links (e.g., via Google Drive, Dropbox) to the other two PDFs, saying "For deeper context, I've also included our streamlined 'Seed Track' proposal and an example of our practical tools." This respects their time while making more detail available.

### **2. For Internal Collaboration (Once you have a founding team):**

Your goal is co-creation and editing.

* **All Documents:** **Markdown (`.md`)** or **ODT (`.odt`) / Google Docs**
    * **Why:** These formats are designed for collaboration.
        * **Markdown** is excellent if your team is comfortable with it (e.g., using a shared Git repository). It's clean and version-controllable.
        * **ODT / Google Docs** are more universally accessible for non-technical collaborators. They allow for easy commenting, track changes, and simultaneous editing.

### **3. For Formal Applications (Grants, Partnerships):**

Your goal is to present a formal, official package.

* **All Documents:** **PDF (`.pdf`)**
    * **Why:** This is the only acceptable format for formal submissions. It ensures your application looks professional and cannot be accidentally altered. You would combine the Executive Summary, a project budget, and other required documents into a single, cohesive PDF package.

### **Summary Table: Format by Use Case**

| Use Case                                  | Document(s) to Share        | **Recommended Format** | Rationale                                          |
| ----------------------------------------- | --------------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Initial Outreach to Advisors/Experts** | Executive Summary           | **PDF** | Professional, universal, easy to read.             |
|                                           | Seed Track, Mapping Tool    | PDF (via link)         | Provides optional depth without overwhelming.      |
| **Internal Team Collaboration** | All working documents       | **ODT or Google Docs** | Best for co-editing, commenting, track changes.    |
| **Formal Grant/Funder Applications** | Full Proposal Package       | **PDF** | Formal, secure, standard for official submissions. |
| **Public Website (Future Goal)** | All public-facing content   | **HTML / Web Pages** | Accessible, interactive, and searchable.           |

**My immediate recommendation:** For the outreach you need to do now, convert your key documents (`Executive Summary`, `Seed Track MVP`, `Stakeholder Mapping Exercise`) into clean, well-formatted **PDFs**. This is the most professional and effective way to make a strong first impression.
