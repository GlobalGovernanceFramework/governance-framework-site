# General Communication Strategy

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Date:** 2025-06-25

## 1. Introduction

The purpose of this document is to ensure that all communications from the Global Governance Frameworks (GGF) initiative are consistent, professional, impactful, and aligned with our core mission and principles. This strategy guides our engagement across all platforms and with all audiences.

## 2. Core Messaging & Tone

* **Mission Statement:** To provide a pragmatic, ready-to-implement framework for upgrading global governance, transforming our systems from generating crises to generating resilience.
* **Elevator Pitch:** "Our 20th-century global systems are failing, creating unacceptable risks from climate change to pandemics. The 'Treaty for Our Only Home' offers a practical blueprint for upgrading this global operating system. It's not about world government, but about creating smarter, more resilient, and more democratic cooperation to ensure a stable and prosperous future."
* **Tone of Voice:** Our voice should always be:
    * **Pragmatic & Grounded:** We are serious, evidence-based, and focused on achievable solutions.
    * **Visionary & Hopeful:** We present a compelling and credible vision for a better future, inspiring action rather than despair.
    * **Principled & Confident:** We are confident in our analysis and grounded in a clear ethical framework.
    * **Non-Partisan & Inclusive:** We speak a universal language that transcends political tribes and national borders.

## 3. Audience Segments

* **Policymakers & Diplomats:**
    * **Goal:** Present the framework as a credible, low-risk, and strategically advantageous solution to their most pressing national and international challenges.
    * **Language:** Focus on risk mitigation, economic stability, and security benefits. Use documents like the "Executive Summary for the Skeptic."
* **Academics & Researchers:**
    * **Goal:** Engage with the theoretical rigor and evidence base of our framework, inviting critique and collaboration.
    * **Language:** Focus on the detailed framework documents, systems thinking, and specific mechanisms.
* **Civil Society & Activists:**
    * **Goal:** Offer a comprehensive, systemic vision that can unite disparate movements around a shared architectural blueprint for change.
    * **Language:** Focus on the principles of justice, equity, inclusion, and the power of citizen-led initiatives.
* **The General Public:**
    * **Goal:** Build broad understanding and political will by making the complex topic of global governance accessible and relevant.
    * **Language:** Use clear, compelling narratives, metaphors (like the "operating system upgrade"), and blog posts that connect the framework to people's daily lives.

## 4. Policy on Political Engagement

All GGF communications must strictly adhere to our **[Official Policy on Political and Partisan Engagement](/docs/communication/policy-on-politics.md)**. All contributors representing the GGF must read and understand this policy before engaging in public discourse.

## 5. Channel-Specific Guidelines

* **Website & Blog (`governanceframeworks.org`):** This is our primary source of truth. The content must be well-researched, professional, and comprehensive. The blog is our space for making our work accessible and sharing our perspective on current events through the lens of our principles.
* **Social Media:** The primary goal is to drive traffic to our website and build awareness.
    * Share key quotes, statistics, and visuals from our work.
    * Remain strictly professional and non-confrontational.
    * **Do not engage in arguments or partisan debates.** Use social media to broadcast our principled stance, not to battle opposing views.
* **Direct Engagement (Meetings, Conferences):** The focus should be on listening and principled advocacy. Present our framework as a potential solution and invite feedback, rather than trying to "win" a debate.

## 6. Crisis Communication Protocol

* **Scenario: Our work is misrepresented** (e.g., "The GGF is calling for an authoritarian world government").
    * **Protocol:**
        1.  Do not engage the source of the misrepresentation directly on social media.
        2.  Draft and publish a clear, calm, and concise blog post titled "Clarifying Our Position on [Topic]."
        3.  In the post, state the misrepresentation and calmly correct it by citing specific sections and principles from our framework (e.g., "Our commitment to the principle of Subsidiarity is fundamental...").
        4.  Share the link to this blog post on social media as our official response.
* **Scenario: A political group co-opts our work for partisan ends.**
    * **Protocol:**
        1.  Issue a public statement on our blog and social media.
        2.  The statement will not attack the group but will re-state our commitment to non-partisanship as outlined in our official policy.
        3.  It will clarify that "we do not endorse any political party" and that our framework is offered as a tool for all to consider.

## 7. Spokesperson Policy

* Official statements on behalf of the Global Governance Frameworks initiative may only be made by the Founding Director and designated members of the future Founding Board.
* Contributors and community members are encouraged to share and discuss the work but should make it clear they are speaking in a personal capacity unless explicitly authorized.

---
*This document should be reviewed annually or as needed by the GGF leadership.*
