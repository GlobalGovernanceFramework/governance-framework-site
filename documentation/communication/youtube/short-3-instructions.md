### **Phase 1: Preparation & Scripting**

1.  **Refine Your Script (Crucial for Shorts):**
    * **Draft:** Write a very tight script, aiming for about 100-120 words for a 30-45 second video.
    * **Key Points to Include:**
        * Hook: Refer back to the polycrisis and the human cost previously discussed.
        * The Answer: Introduce the "Treaty for Our Only Home" as the solution.
        * What it is: Describe it as a "blueprint for civilizational evolution".
        * The Transformation: Emphasize its goal to shift from "crisis-generating to resilience-generating governance systems".
        * The Big Idea: Mention "upgrading our global operating system".
        * The Possibility: Reinforce that we have the technology and knowledge to do this.
        * Call to Action: Direct to your website for more details.
    * **Example Script (feel free to adapt):**
        > "We've seen the polycrisis, and its immense human cost. But what if we had a way forward?
        > Introducing **The Treaty for Our Only Home** – a blueprint for civilizational evolution.
        > This isn't just about reform; it's about transforming our governance from generating crises to building planetary resilience.
        > It’s an urgent upgrade to our global operating system, leveraging technology and knowledge we already possess.
        > Discover how we can co-create a future of shared flourishing.

2.  **Gather Your Assets:**
    * **Voiceover Audio:**
        * **Option A (Your Voice):** Record yourself reading the script clearly. Focus on a confident, hopeful, and inspiring tone.
        * **Option B (AI Text-to-Speech):** Generate the audio using your chosen AI voice.
    * **Background Music:** Select an uplifting, inspiring, and slightly grand royalty-free background track that conveys hope and progress.
    * **Visuals (Stock Footage/Images):**
        * **Source:** Free stock video sites like Pexels, Pixabay, Unsplash (for images).
        * **Ideas for this video:**
            * Opening: A quick visual reminder of the previous video's theme (e.g., abstract representation of chaos or a fleeting image of struggle).
            * The Treaty: The most important visual is **your created Facebook header image concept** (Earth cradled by hands, with the Treaty title). You could make this a central, prominent visual for several seconds.
            * Evolution/Upgrade: Imagery of progress, growth, interconnectedness (e.g., time-lapses of cities, abstract network visuals, global cooperation).
            * Resilience/Hope: Scenes of thriving nature, diverse people collaborating, hands building something together, light spreading.
        * **Quantity:** Aim for 5-10 short (2-5 second) clips/images that visually represent points in your script.
    * **Your Logo Watermark:** Ensure your Global Governance Framework logo PNG with a transparent background is ready. This will be your video watermark.
