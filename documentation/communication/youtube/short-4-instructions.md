**Target Length:** 30-45 seconds.

### **Phase 1: Preparation & Scripting**

1.  **Refine Your Script (Crucial for Shorts):**
    * **Draft:** Write a very tight script, aiming for about 100-120 words for a 30-45 second video.
    * **Key Points to Include:**
        * Hook: Briefly reference the challenges (polycrisis) but immediately pivot to the possibility of a better future.
        * The Transformation: Explain that the Treaty's ultimate goal is a shift from "crisis-generating to resilience-generating systems".
        * What Resilience Means: Briefly touch upon characteristics of resilient systems (e.g., adaptability, learning from mistakes).
        * The Opportunity: Emphasize that systems that amplify failure *can be redesigned* to amplify success.
        * Call to Action: Direct to your website for the "roadmap for conscious evolution".
    * **Example Script (feel free to adapt):**
        > "We're facing unprecedented global challenges. But what if our response wasn't just survival, but true transformation?
        > The Treaty for Our Only Home envisions a fundamental shift: from systems that generate crisis to systems that generate **resilience**.
        > Imagine governance that learns, adapts, and builds in diversity. Systems designed to amplify success, not just spread failure.
        > This is about more than fixing problems; it's about conscious evolution towards a thriving future for our planet.
        > Discover this roadmap to resilience at GlobalGovernanceFramework.org. Subscribe and be part of the change!"

2.  **Gather Your Assets:**
    * **Voiceover Audio:**
        * **Option A (Your Voice):** Record yourself reading the script. Maintain an inspiring, hopeful, and slightly urgent tone.
        * **Option B (AI Text-to-Speech):** Generate the audio using your chosen AI voice.
    * **Background Music:** Select an uplifting, dynamic, and forward-looking royalty-free background track that conveys hope and positive change.
    * **Visuals (Stock Footage/Images):**
        * **Source:** Free stock video sites like Pexels, Pixabay, Unsplash (for images).
        * **Ideas for this video:**
            * Opening: A very brief, abstract hint of struggle or chaos.
            * Transition: A visual metaphor for change/transformation (e.g., gears turning, abstract lines resolving into order, a sunrise, a blooming plant).
            * Resilience: Imagery of strong, adaptable natural systems (e.g., thriving forests, diverse ecosystems), or communities collaborating and adapting.
            * Success Amplified: Visuals of widespread positive impact (e.g., renewable energy, restored landscapes, happy, diverse people collaborating globally).
            * Conscious Evolution: Imagery suggesting growth, progress, or looking to the future.
        * **Quantity:** Aim for 5-10 short (2-5 second) clips/images that visually represent points in your script.
    * **Your Logo Watermark:** Ensure your Global Governance Framework logo PNG with a transparent background is ready. This will be your video watermark.
