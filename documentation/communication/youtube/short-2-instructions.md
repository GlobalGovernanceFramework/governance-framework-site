### **Phase 1: Preparation & Scripting**

1.  **Refine Your Script (Crucial for Shorts):**
    * **Draft:** Write a very tight script, aiming for about 100-120 words for a 30-45 second video.
    * **Key Points to Include:**
        * Hook: Start with a poignant question or statement about the real-world impact of abstract policy failures.
        * Specific Examples: Use concrete examples from the Treaty's introduction about human costs.
            * Climate displacement (21.5 million people annually since 2008).
            * Economic inequality (richest 1% own more than bottom 50%).
            * Healthcare system failures (e.g., insulin rationing).
        * Reinforce the "polycrisis" idea: these are interconnected, not isolated.
        * Consequence: Our current systems are failing real people.
        * Tease Solution: Briefly hint that a solution (the Treaty) exists to address these.
        * Call to Action: Direct to your website.
    * **Example Script (feel free to adapt):**
        > "When global systems fail, real people pay the price. It’s not abstract policy.
        > Since 2008, climate disruption has displaced 21.5 million annually. Economic inequality means the richest 1% own more than the bottom 50%. And patients, like those needing insulin, face systems prioritizing profit over survival.
        > These are the devastating human costs of our current governance failures. They are interconnected threads of the polycrisis.
        > But there’s a blueprint for change, a way to put people first.

2.  **Gather Your Assets:**
    * **Voiceover Audio:**
        * **Option A (Your Voice):** Record yourself reading the script clearly. Use a good microphone if you have one, or your phone's voice recorder in a quiet room. Aim for clear articulation and consistent volume.
        * **Option B (AI Text-to-Speech):** Use an online text-to-speech generator for your script. Download the audio file.
    * **Background Music:** Choose a royalty-free, perhaps slightly more somber or urgent, but ultimately hopeful background track. Ensure it complements the emotional tone of the script.
    * **Visuals (Stock Footage/Images):**
        * **Source:** Free stock video sites like Pexels, Pixabay, Unsplash (for images).
        * **Ideas for this video:**
            * Opening: Imagery depicting concern or struggle, but not overly graphic.
            * Climate Disruption: Clips of flooded homes, displaced families, or abstract climate change impacts.
            * Economic Inequality: Visuals of stark contrast (e.g., simple living vs. opulence, abstract graphs showing disparity).
            * Healthcare: Images of medical care, people receiving support (avoid anything overly clinical or distressing for brevity).
            * Interconnectedness: Subtle visual cues of connections or global issues.
            * Solution Hint: Transition to hopeful imagery – people connecting, looking towards a horizon, collaborative action.
        * **Quantity:** Aim for 5-10 short (2-5 second) clips/images that visually represent points in your script.
    * **Your Logo Watermark:** Ensure you have your Global Governance Framework logo as a high-resolution PNG with a transparent background ready. This will be your video watermark.
