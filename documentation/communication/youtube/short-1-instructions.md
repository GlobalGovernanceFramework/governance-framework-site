## Step-by-Step Guide: Creating Your First YouTube Short ("What is the Polycrisis?")

**Video Topic:** What is the Polycrisis?
**Goal:** To introduce the concept of the "polycrisis" as interconnected global failures, establish the urgency, and hint at the need for a new approach (the Treaty).
**Target Length:** 30-45 seconds.

---

### **Phase 1: Preparation & Scripting**

1.  **Refine Your Script (Crucial for Shorts):**
    * **Draft:** Write a very tight script, aiming for about 100-120 words for a 30-45 second video.
    * **Key Points to Include:**
        * Hook: Acknowledge the feeling of overwhelming global problems.
        * Definition: Introduce "polycrisis" as interconnected failures.
        * Examples: Briefly mention climate, economic, political failures amplifying each other.
        * Urgency: Emphasize that current systems are inadequate.
        * Tease Solution: Hint that a new approach is needed.
        * Call to Action: Direct to your website.
    * **Example Script (feel free to adapt):**
        > "Feeling swamped by global crises? Wildfires, economic jitters, political polarization... It's not just one problem.
        > We're in a **polycrisis** â€“ interconnected failures in our climate, economy, and political systems, amplifying each other in dangerous ways. Think climate change fueling migration, or inequality eroding trust.
        > Our old governance systems can't keep up. The human cost is immense.
        > But what if we could upgrade our global operating system? Discover the blueprint for planetary resilience.

2.  **Gather Your Assets:**
    * **Voiceover Audio:**
        * **Option A (Your Voice):** Record yourself reading the script clearly. Use a good microphone if you have one, or even your phone's voice recorder in a quiet room. Aim for clear articulation and consistent volume.
        * **Option B (AI Text-to-Speech):** If you prefer, use a free online text-to-speech generator (e.g., Google Text-to-Speech via various online tools, or some free trials of paid services). Input your script and download the audio file.
    * **Background Music:** Find some royalty-free, subtle, impactful background music. Sites like Pixabay, Bensound, or YouTube's Audio Library offer free options. Choose something that enhances the tone but doesn't distract from your voiceover.
    * **Visuals (Stock Footage/Images):**
        * **Source:** Free stock video sites like Pexels, Pixabay, Unsplash (for images).
        * **Ideas for this video:**
            * Opening: Abstract "noise" or quick cuts of diverse global scenes.
            * Polycrisis: Imagery suggesting chaos, interconnectedness (e.g., global networks, breaking patterns).
            * Specific Crises: Brief clips or images related to climate (e.g., droughts, storms), economics (e.g., market graphs, poverty), politics (e.g., protests, blurred news screens).
            * Shift/Solution Hint: Imagery of people collaborating, positive global views, hands working together.
        * **Quantity:** Aim for 5-10 short (2-5 second) clips/images that visually represent points in your script.
    * **Your Logo Watermark:** Ensure you have your Global Governance Framework logo as a high-resolution PNG with a transparent background ready. This will be your video watermark.

### **Phase 2: Kdenlive Workflow**

1.  **Set up Your Kdenlive Project:**
    * Open Kdenlive.
    * Go to `File > New`.
    * In the "Project Settings" window:
        * **Profile:** Select a vertical resolution suitable for Shorts. Look for profiles like `HD 1080p 30 fps (1080x1920) - vertical`. If not available, manually set `Width: 1080` and `Height: 1920` (and `Frame rate: 30` or `25` depending on your region). This is crucial for Shorts.
        * **Project Folder:** Choose a dedicated folder on your computer to save your project and all associated files.
    * Click `OK`.

2.  **Import Your Assets:**
    * In the "Project Bin" (top-left window), right-click and choose `Add Clip or Folder`.
    * Navigate to your prepared voiceover audio, background music, visual clips/images, and your logo PNG. Select them all and click `Open`.

3.  **Assemble the Rough Cut (Voiceover First):**
    * **Voiceover:** Drag your voiceover audio clip from the "Project Bin" onto an audio track (e.g., `Audio 1`) in the Timeline (bottom section).
    * **Background Music:** Drag your background music clip to a separate audio track (e.g., `Audio 2`).
    * **Visuals:** Drag your visual clips/images onto the video tracks (`Video 1`, `Video 2`, etc.) above your audio. Arrange them roughly to match what you're talking about in your voiceover. Make sure they are *full screen* (fill the vertical frame). If horizontal, you'll need to zoom/pan.
    * **Logo Watermark:** Drag your logo PNG onto the highest video track (e.g., `Video 3`). Stretch its duration to cover the *entire length* of your video.

4.  **Refine & Polish Visuals:**
    * **Trim Clips:** Use the razor tool (or `Shift+R`) to cut your video clips and images to fit the timing of your voiceover. Delete unwanted parts.
    * **Adjust Clip Lengths:** Drag the ends of clips on the timeline to shorten or lengthen them.
    * **Simple Transitions:** For a smooth flow, add simple transitions between video clips. Drag from the edge of one clip to overlap the next, and Kdenlive will often suggest a dissolve. You can also drag effects from the "Effects" tab (`F2`) onto the clip transitions. Keep it simple for now (e.g., `Dissolve`).
    * **Positioning/Zoom (if needed):** If your stock footage is horizontal, right-click the clip on the timeline, choose `Add Effect > Transform > Position and Zoom`. Use the properties window (usually bottom-left) to zoom in and position the relevant part of the horizontal video to fill your vertical frame.

5.  **Refine & Polish Audio:**
    * **Volume Levels:** The most common mistake for newbies! Your voiceover MUST be clearly audible over the background music.
        * Right-click your background music clip on the timeline, choose `Add Effect > Audio Correction > Volume (Keyframable)`.
        * In the properties window, reduce the overall volume of the music drastically (e.g., -15dB to -25dB) so it's very subtle. You can also add "keyframe" points to reduce music volume even further when you're speaking, and raise it slightly in silent gaps.
    * **Fade In/Out:** Add a simple fade-in to your music at the start and a fade-out at the end. Right-click the audio clip, choose `Add Effect > Audio Correction > Fade In` and `Fade Out`.

6.  **Add Text Overlays / Titles:**
    * Go to `Project > Add Title Clip` (or click the 'T' icon in the toolbar).
    * Choose `Default Title`.
    * Type your key phrases (e.g., "Polycrisis," "Interconnected Failures," "Planetary Resilience").
    * Choose a clear, readable font. Adjust size, color, and position to be highly visible. Avoid putting text too close to the very top or bottom edges, as these can be obscured by YouTube's interface.
    * Click `OK`.
    * Drag your new "Title Clip" from the "Project Bin" onto a video track *above* your main video clips (e.g., `Video 2` or `Video 3` if your logo is on `Video 4`). Adjust its duration to appear only when needed.

7.  **Position Your Logo Watermark:**
    * Select your logo PNG clip on the timeline.
    * Right-click and choose `Add Effect > Transform > Position and Zoom`.
    * In the properties window, adjust the `X` and `Y` values to place it in a corner (e.g., top-right or bottom-left).
    * Adjust `Size` to make it visible but not distracting.
    * Add `Add Effect > Alpha Manipulation > Opacity`. Reduce the `Opacity` value (e.g., to 30-50%) to make it semi-transparent.

8.  **Add Captions (VERY Important for Shorts):**
    * **Option A (Manual - Recommended for precision):**
        * Go to `Project > Subtitles`.
        * Click the `+` button to add a new subtitle.
        * Type a short phrase of your script.
        * Adjust the start and end time of the subtitle to match your voiceover precisely.
        * Repeat for each phrase.
        * Kdenlive's subtitle tool is excellent for this.
    * **Option B (Generate from Speech):** Kdenlive also has experimental features to generate subtitles from speech, but manual tweaking is almost always needed for accuracy.
    * **Styling:** Ensure your captions are a good size, clear font, and have good contrast (e.g., white text with a black outline or shadow) so they are readable on any background.

### **Phase 3: Exporting & Uploading**

1.  **Export Your Video from Kdenlive:**
    * Go to `Project > Render` (or click the Render icon in the toolbar).
    * **Render Profile:**
        * Choose `MP4`.
        * Look for a profile like `HD 1080p` or `h.264`.
        * **Crucially, double-check that the `Resolution` is set to `1080x1920` (vertical) or `1080x1920 (Shorts)` if Kdenlive offers it explicitly.** If not, manually enter `1080` for Width and `1920` for Height.
        * **Frame rate:** Match your project settings (30 or 25 fps).
    * **Output File:** Choose a descriptive filename (e.g., `GGF_Polycrisis_Short.mp4`) and location.
    * Click `Render to File`. This process might take some time depending on your computer's power and video length.

2.  **Upload to YouTube:**
    * Go to YouTube.com and log into your Global Governance Framework channel.
    * Click the "Create" button (camera icon) in the top right, then `Upload Video`.
    * Select your exported MP4 file.
    * **Details:**
        * **Title:** "What is the Polycrisis? | Global Governance Framework" (or similar).
        * **Description:** A short version of your channel description, plus a direct link to the relevant section of your blog post or the main Treaty page (globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/docs/implementation/treaty-for-our-only-home).
        * **Visibility:** Set to `Public`.
        * **Audience:** Select `No, it's not made for kids.`
        * **Tags:** Add your relevant tags (e.g., #Polycrisis #GlobalGovernance #SystemicChange #PlanetaryResilience #TreatyForOurOnlyHome).
        * **Crucially, add `#Shorts` in the title OR description** to ensure YouTube recognizes it as a Short and puts it in the Shorts feed.

Congratulations! This is a comprehensive guide to getting your first Short out there. It will take time to learn Kdenlive, but each video will get easier and faster. Good luck!
