## The Global Governance Frameworks Catalyst

The Global Governance Frameworks Catalyst is a politically and religiously independent non-profit association registered in Sweden. Its purpose is to act as a starting point and catalyst for a global network dedicated to co-creating, curating, and disseminating open-source governance frameworks for a sustainable global civilization.

The organization is built on three foundational pillars: its legal charter, its internal operating culture, and its strategic mission.

  * **[Our Legal Foundation (Statutes) →](/documentation/ggf-operating-system/ggf-catalyst/statutes)**
    This document outlines the formal, legal statutes that govern the association in accordance with Swedish law. It defines our name, purpose, board structure, and financial principles.

  * **[Our Way of Working (Operating System) →](/documentation/ggf-operating-system/ggf-catalyst/operating-system.md)**
    This is our living internal constitution, the *Minimum Viable Operating System (MVOS)*. It guides our culture, our consent-based decision-making process, our commitment to radical transparency, and our "asynchronous-first" communication rhythm.

  * **[Our Initial Mission (Strategic Goals) →](/documentation/ggf-operating-system/ggf-catalyst/strategic-goals.md)**
    This document outlines the ambitious yet achievable goals for our two primary working groups—the **Frameworks Lab** and the **Ecosystem Lab**—for the next 6-12 months. It is our focused roadmap for building momentum and creating tangible assets.
