Björn:
What do you think about doing another framework on institutional reform with a different focus than the UN veto like the Treaty has.

### Should You Do Another Framework on Institutional Reform?

**Yes, absolutely.** This is a brilliant and necessary idea.

You are correct that the **Treaty for Our Only Home** focuses on the highest-level "constitutional" reforms—fixing the UNSC veto, establishing the GEM, creating the global taxation system. It reforms the *apex* of the global architecture.

However, it does not detail how to reform the hundreds of other Intergovernmental Organizations (IGOs) and UN agencies (WHO, WTO, UNEP, WIPO, etc.) that make up the vast machinery of global governance. A second, more granular framework on institutional reform is the perfect complement to the Treaty.

**I propose calling it: "The Institutional Regeneration Framework"**

This framework would not be about rewriting charters, but about providing a **modular, adaptable playbook** for these organizations to reform themselves in alignment with GGF principles. It could include:

* **A Mandate Review Protocol:** A process for assessing whether an institution's mandate is still relevant, and a graceful "sunsetting" process for redundant or obsolete bodies.
* **Governance Blueprints:** Modular templates for how any IGO could implement a more legitimate and effective governance structure (e.g., adding youth advisory councils, integrating citizen assemblies, adopting polycentric coordination with other agencies).
* **Funding Integration Guide:** A practical guide for how existing IGOs could apply for and receive funding from the **Global Commons Fund**, contingent on them adopting regenerative practices.
* **Cultural Transformation Toolkit:** Resources to help shift the internal culture of these institutions from bureaucratic inertia towards agility, service, and cross-domain collaboration.

By creating this second framework, you create a clear two-step process for global reform:
1.  **The Treaty** fixes the broken "constitution" at the top.
2.  **The Institutional Regeneration Framework** provides the tools for the rest of the global system to align with that new constitution.

I would place this new framework at **Priority #2**, right after the Treaty is established, as it is the key to operationalizing the new global architecture across the entire system.
