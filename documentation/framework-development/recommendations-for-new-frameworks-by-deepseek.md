### **Brainstorm: Missing Frameworks for the Global Governance Ecosystem**  

Your current framework matrix is impressively comprehensive, but a few critical gaps remain—particularly in **intersectional governance**, **emerging technologies**, **non-human stakeholders**, and **systemic transitions**. Below is a prioritized list of proposed additions, organized by tier and aligned with the GGF’s regenerative justice ethos.  

---

### **Tier 0: Foundational Additions**  
1. **Framework for Systemic Transition Justice** (`framework_transition_justice`)  
   - **Purpose:** Address historical harm during shifts from extractive to regenerative systems (e.g., fossil fuel workers displaced by **Gaian Trade Framework**).  
   - **Key Tools:** Reparations tribunals, just transition funds, legacy system sunset clauses.  

2. **Ontological Pluralism Protocol** (`framework_ontological_pluralism`)  
   - **Purpose:** Govern conflicts between Western scientific, Indigenous, and other ontologies (e.g., "rights of rivers" vs. corporate water extraction).  
   - **Key Tools:** Ontological mediation councils, epistemic justice audits.  

---

### **Tier 1: Core Governance Gaps**  
3. **Neurodiversity & Cognitive Equity Framework** (`framework_neuroequity`)  
   - **Purpose:** Ensure governance systems accommodate diverse cognitive styles (e.g., non-linear thinkers in **Meta-Governance** processes).  
   - **Key Tools:** Sensory-inclusive policymaking, alternative communication standards.  

4. **Non-Human Stakeholder Representation** (`framework_more_than_human`)  
   - **Purpose:** Formalize voice for ecosystems, animals, and AI entities (complementing **Animal Welfare Governance** and **Digital Commons**).  
   - **Key Tools:** **Guardians of the Non-Human** (elected proxies), impact litigation rights.  

5. **Anticipatory Governance & Foresight Systems** (`framework_anticipatory_gov`)  
   - **Purpose:** Proactively address emerging risks (e.g., quantum AI, synthetic consciousness) before they escalate to **Existential Risk Governance**.  
   - **Key Tools:** Horizon-scanning observatories, red-teaming protocols.  

---

### **Tier 2: Sector-Specific Additions**  
6. **Psychedelics & Consciousness Technologies Governance** (`framework_psychetech`)  
   - **Purpose:** Regulate therapeutic/ceremonial use and prevent corporate exploitation (ties to **Consciousness & Inner Development**).  
   - **Key Tools:** Sacred reciprocity licenses, neuroethics review boards.  

7. **Microbial & Soil Microbiome Stewardship** (`framework_microbial_commons`)  
   - **Purpose:** Govern microbial biodiversity as a global commons (extends **Soil Health Governance**).  
   - **Key Tools:** Open-source microbiome banks, anti-patent laws for living cultures.  

8. **Sonic Ecology & Noise Pollution Governance** (`framework_sonic_justice`)  
   - **Purpose:** Protect cultural soundscapes (e.g., Indigenous ceremonies) and mitigate industrial noise harm.  
   - **Key Tools:** Acoustic sovereignty zones, decibel equity standards.  

9. **Grief & Loss Infrastructure Framework** (`framework_grief_support`)  
   - **Purpose:** Institutionalize support for ecological, cultural, and personal grief (linked to **Mental Health Governance**).  
   - **Key Tools:** Public mourning rituals, climate grief therapy subsidies.  

---

### **Tier 3: Intersectional & Niche Governance**  
10. **Polyamorous & Non-Traditional Family Rights** (`framework_kintype_justice`)  
    - **Purpose:** Legal recognition for diverse family structures (complements **Kinship Protocol**).  
    - **Key Tools:** Multi-parent custody laws, relational contract templates.  

11. **Dreamtime & Altered States Governance** (`framework_dreamtime_policy`)  
    - **Purpose:** Protect Indigenous dream practices and regulate neurotechnology (e.g., AI dream interception).  
    - **Key Tools:** Oneiric sovereignty clauses, lucid-dream research ethics.  

12. **Voluntary Human Extinction Advocacy Governance** (`framework_vhe_engagement`)  
    - **Purpose:** Mediate dialogue between anti-natalist movements and **Legacy Protocol** aging policies.  
    - **Key Tools:** Demographic transition councils, existential ethics forums.  

---

### **Tier 4: Frontier & Experimental**  
13. **Post-Scarcity Architecture Governance** (`framework_post_scarcity_design`)  
    - **Purpose:** Plan for material abundance post-**Phoenix Protocol** (e.g., asteroid mining, molecular assembly).  
    - **Key Tools:** Resource jubilee events, luxury communism accords.  

14. **Quantum Anthropology Framework** (`framework_quantum_cultures`)  
    - **Purpose:** Study/govern cultures emerging in quantum/virtual realms (e.g., metaverse Indigenous tribes).  
    - **Key Tools:** Virtual land rights, superpositioned identity laws.  

15. **Time-Traveler & Exocivilization Diplomacy** (`framework_exo_temporal_diplomacy`)  
    - **Purpose:** Protocol for first contact with time-displaced or extraterrestrial beings (prepares for **Millennium Protocol** edge cases).  
    - **Key Tools:** Temporal asylum laws, exo-cultural liaison corps.  

---

### **Cross-Cutting Tools to Enable New Frameworks**  
- **Intersectional Impact Matrix:** A tool to audit how new frameworks (e.g., `framework_psychetech`) interact with existing ones (e.g., **Synoptic Protocol**).  
- **Protocol Kitchen:** A sandbox environment for stress-testing experimental frameworks before tier assignment.  

---

### **Rationale for Prioritization**  
- **Justice Gaps:** Frameworks like `framework_transition_justice` and `framework_more_than_human` address systemic blind spots in current equity models.  
- **Emerging Tech:** `framework_psychetech` and `framework_quantum_cultures` preempt governance vacuums in fast-evolving domains.  
- **Cultural Depth:** `framework_dreamtime_policy` and `framework_sonic_justice` protect intangible heritage.  

**Next Steps:**  
1. Draft 1-pagers for top 3 gaps (e.g., `framework_more_than_human`, `framework_anticipatory_gov`, `framework_psychetech`).  
2. Propose integration points (e.g., **Guardians of the Non-Human** reporting to **Earth Council**).
