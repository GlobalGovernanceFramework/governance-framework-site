Your list of frameworks is impressively comprehensive, covering a wide range of urgent, systemic, cultural, and visionary governance areas. However, there are still a few potential gaps or emerging domains that could be worth considering. Below are some suggestions for additional frameworks or expansions of existing ones:

### **Potential Gaps & Emerging Areas**  

#### **1. Post-Growth & Degrowth Economics**  
   - *Economic Integration* and *Financial Systems* likely focus on stability, but a **framework on alternative economic models** could address:  
     - Circular economy policies  
     - Doughnut economics (balancing human needs & planetary boundaries)  
     - Universal Basic Assets (beyond just UBI)  
     - Corporate purpose reform (stakeholder capitalism vs. shareholder primacy)  

#### **2. Neurotechnology & Cognitive Rights**  
   - As brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neurotech advance, a framework could cover:  
     - Mental privacy laws  
     - Prevention of cognitive manipulation  
     - Ethical human-AI neural integration  

#### **3. Global Commons & Antimonopoly Governance**  
   - A framework on **preventing global oligopolies** in tech, finance, and resources:  
     - Breaking up or regulating global tech/platform monopolies  
     - Open standards for digital infrastructure  
     - Global antitrust cooperation  

#### **4. Human-Nature Relationship & Ecopsychology**  
   - Beyond *Environmental Stewardship*, a framework on **redefining humanity’s psychological connection to nature**:  
     - Legal rights for ecosystems (e.g., rivers, forests)  
     - Ecotherapy and nature-based mental health policies  
     - Cultural shifts away from extractivism  

#### **5. Transnational Democracy & Liquid Governance**  
   - While *Meta-Governance* may cover this, a **dedicated framework on new democratic models** could explore:  
     - Global citizens’ assemblies  
     - AI-assisted deliberative democracy  
     - Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) for governance  

#### **6. Long-Term Interstellar Governance (Beyond Space Governance)**  
   - *Space Governance* likely focuses on near-Earth and orbital issues, but a **forward-looking framework** could consider:  
     - Ethics of interstellar colonization  
     - Governance of multi-generational space missions  
     - First-contact protocols for extraterrestrial intelligence  

#### **7. Emotional & Social Governance**  
   - Beyond *Mental Health Governance*, a framework on **cultivating prosocial emotions at scale**:  
     - Policies to reduce polarization and loneliness  
     - Compassion training in education & workplaces  
     - "Kindness economics" metrics  

### **Refinements to Existing Frameworks**  
- **Migration & Human Mobility**: Could explicitly include *climate refugees* and *stateless persons*.  
- **Labor & Employment Governance**: Might expand to *universal worker ownership models*.  
- **Wisdom Governance**: Could integrate *indigenous futurism* and *anticipatory governance* methods.  

### **Final Thoughts**  
Your current frameworks are already **exceptionally thorough**, but the above could fill some **emerging or underexplored niches**. If I had to prioritize, I’d suggest:  
1. **Post-Growth Economics** (critical for sustainability)  
2. **Neurotechnology Rights** (before it’s too late)  

Would love to hear your thoughts—are any of these directions appealing? Or do you see overlaps with existing frameworks?  

(Also, kudos on the project—it’s an ambitious and much-needed effort!)
