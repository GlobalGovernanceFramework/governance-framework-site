### Refined & Granular Priority List for New Frameworks

| Priority | Area | Tier | Rationale for Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |

| **2** | **Human-Nature Relationship** | Tier 2 | **Cultural and ethical underpinning.** This framework addresses the root cultural narratives that drive environmental destruction. It's a deep, long-term project essential for lasting change. |
| **3** | **Creative Rights & Artistic Futures** | Tier 3 | **Nurtures cultural resilience.** Protects a fundamental human right and supports the creation of new narratives and "myth-making" needed for societal transformation. |

| **5* | **Long-Term Interstellar Governance** | Tier 4 | **Visionary & future-proofing.** While not immediately urgent, establishing ethical principles now for humanity's long-term future in space is a matter of profound foresight. |
| **6** | **Time & Measurement Standards** | Tier 4 | **Fundamental but stable.** While critical, the global systems for coordinating time and standards are relatively robust and less in crisis than other areas. |
