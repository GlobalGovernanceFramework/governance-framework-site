### Refined & Granular Priority List for New Frameworks

| Priority | Area | Tier | Rationale for Priority |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | **Global Institutional Reform** | Tier 1 | **Foundation for all other action.** Without legitimate, effective, and trusted global institutions (UN, etc.), implementing any other framework becomes nearly impossible. This is the bedrock. | Done as the 'Treaty for Our Only Home', could be expanded.
| **2** | **Energy Transition Governance** | Tier 1 | **Urgent climate imperative.** Directly linked to the most pressing aspects of climate change. A just and rapid energy transition is critical to preventing catastrophic environmental tipping points. |
| **3** | **Cybersecurity & Digital Infrastructure** | Tier 2 | **Protection of critical systems.** Closely linked to #6 and #7, this focuses on protecting the essential digital arteries of global society from collapse or weaponization. |
| **4** | **Global Trade & Resource Governance** | Tier 1 | **Prevents resource-based conflict.** As demand for strategic resources (rare earths, water) grows, the potential for conflict increases. This is a foundational issue for long-term peace. |
| **5** | **Global Public Goods** | Tier 1 | **Core principle of cooperation.** While lower in priority as a *new* framework (as it's a meta-concept), formalizing its principles is key to justifying and funding action in many other areas. |
| **6* | **Arctic & Polar Governance** | Tier 4 | **Emerging geopolitical hotspot.** The melting of polar ice is opening new shipping lanes and resource access, creating a new arena for great power competition and ecological devastation. High urgency in a specific domain. |
| **7** | **Post-Growth & Degrowth Economics** | Tier 2 | **Fundamental paradigm shift.** Explores necessary alternatives to an economic model that is hitting planetary limits. Essential for long-term sustainability but requires significant foundational work. |
| **8** | **Public Participation & Transnational Democracy** | Tier 2/3 | **Enhances legitimacy and effectiveness.** New models of democracy are needed to build public trust and buy-in for global initiatives. Supports #1. *(Merged for focus).* |
| **9** | **Care Work & Informal Economies** | Tier 3 | **Addresses a massive blind spot.** This work, largely done by women, is foundational to all economic activity but remains unmeasured and unsupported. A key issue for equity. |
| **10** | **Intellectual Property & Knowledge Sharing** | Tier 2 | **Reduces global inequity.** The current IP regime often hinders access to critical knowledge and technology for developing nations. Important for justice and global development. |
| **11** | **Global Nutrition & Diets** | Tier 2 | **Critical health and food system link.** Addresses the "slow pandemic" of malnutrition and diet-related disease, a major factor in overall global health and equity. |
| **12** | **Transportation & Mobility** | Tier 2 | **Key for decarbonization and equity.** Governance of global transport is essential for meeting climate goals and ensuring equitable access to economic opportunities. |
| **13** | **Human-Nature Relationship** | Tier 2 | **Cultural and ethical underpinning.** This framework addresses the root cultural narratives that drive environmental destruction. It's a deep, long-term project essential for lasting change. |
| **14** | **Creative Rights & Artistic Futures** | Tier 3 | **Nurtures cultural resilience.** Protects a fundamental human right and supports the creation of new narratives and "myth-making" needed for societal transformation. |
| **15** | **Tourism & Cultural Exchange** | Tier 3 | **Balances economic activity with preservation.** A more specific framework that addresses the tangible impacts of global mobility on local cultures and ecosystems. |
| **16** | **Long-Term Interstellar Governance** | Tier 4 | **Visionary & future-proofing.** While not immediately urgent, establishing ethical principles now for humanity's long-term future in space is a matter of profound foresight. |
| **17** | **Time & Measurement Standards** | Tier 4 | **Fundamental but stable.** While critical, the global systems for coordinating time and standards are relatively robust and less in crisis than other areas. |
