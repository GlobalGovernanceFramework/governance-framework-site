## Printer Recommendation

For printing text-heavy documents cost-effectively, a **monochrome (black and white) laser printer** is your best option. They are far cheaper per page than inkjet printers.

* **Recommendation:** Look for an entry-level **Brother** laser printer.
    * **Why Brother?** They are known for their reliability, affordable third-party toner cartridges (which dramatically lowers printing costs), and excellent driver support.
    * **Model Type:** Look for models like the `Brother HL-L23xxD` series (e.g., HL-L2350DW, HL-L2370DN).
    * **Where to Buy:** You can often find excellent deals on used or refurbished models on sites like Blocket or Tradera, which would be a very resource-conscious choice. Just check the remaining toner level.

A printer will be a valuable asset, allowing you to create these tangible "Welcome Packages" that people can hold, read, and reflect on between your weekly meetings.
