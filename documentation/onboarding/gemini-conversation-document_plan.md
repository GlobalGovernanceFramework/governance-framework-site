Björn:
Let's think about all the documents we need to create for getting people involved.

A bonus is that we can probably use the same ones for people outside the organization that wants to contribute as well as for the ones inside it!

I have some initial ideas for "Basics" documents (we cannot assume much prior knowledge and should be as inclusive as possible to align with our ethos)

- Working with A.I. : I have begun outlining my processes on paper as for the moment best practices with Claude, you, Grok, ChatGPT and DeepSeek (perhaps we should add a note about Perplexity which is for me a more niche case) in a beginner friendly way.

- Working with git. Git is crucial for the project, and it will help make me use it better to write a guide for it.

More specialized guides should be created as we go along for outreach for example, and translations. I don't know about tech, I'm not a very skilled programmer in terms of what is required, having worked mostly with Fortran, C and Matlab in the passed. I am relying heavily on Claude for this project, and have not started anything other than the website for the project.

Gemini:
This is a fantastic and crucial line of thinking. Creating a clear and welcoming onboarding path is just as important as creating the frameworks themselves. Your instinct that the same documents can serve both internal and external contributors is spot on—it ensures everyone starts with the same cultural DNA.

Let's build on your ideas and structure a complete **Contributor Onboarding Pathway**. We'll design it in layers, from the most universal welcome to role-specific training.

### The Contributor Onboarding Pathway

This pathway is designed to be a self-guided journey that someone can take at their own pace, with support from you or other members.

#### **Level 1: The Core Welcome Kit (For Everyone)**

This is the first package anyone receives, whether they are a potential co-founder like Emil or an online contributor. Its purpose is to align them with the *vision* and *culture* before they do anything else. You've already done the groundwork for this.

* **Document 1: GGF Catalyst Overview** (Swedish/English)
    * *Content:* The one-page summary we discussed, explaining the vision and the non-profit's purpose.
* **Document 2: Our Way of Working (MVOS)** (Swedish/English)
    * *Content:* The guide to your internal operating system, focusing on **Radical Autonomy**, the **`Hearts`-based system**, and asynchronous work.
* **Document 3: The Legal Foundation** (Swedish)
    * *Content:* The full statutes of the *ideell förening*. Presented as a reference for transparency.

#### **Level 2: The Foundational Skills (The "GGF Basics")**

These are the guides you identified, which are essential for *anyone* who wants to actively contribute to the project's content.

**Guide 1: Working with AI – Our Co-Pilot**
Your idea for this is perfect. A guide would empower contributors and standardize quality. I suggest structuring it like this:

* **Our AI Philosophy:** Explain that we see AI as a powerful "co-pilot" for research, drafting, and summarizing, but human wisdom, ethics, and final judgment are irreplaceable.
* **Our Recommended Toolkit:**
    * **For Creative Drafting & Synthesis:** Claude 3 (Opus/Sonnet)
    * **For Factual Research & Quick Answers:** Perplexity
    * **For Brainstorming & Alternative Perspectives:** ChatGPT, Grok
    * **For Code & Technical Tasks:** DeepSeek Coder, Claude 3
    * **For General Support & Integration:** Gemini
* **The Core Process (A Beginner's Guide):**
    * **Step 1: The Prompt.** How to give the AI context and a clear persona.
    * **Step 2: The Conversation.** How to refine the output through dialogue.
    * **Step 3: Verification.** The absolute necessity of fact-checking and never trusting an AI's output blindly.
    * **Step 4: Integration.** How to weave the AI-generated text into our frameworks with a human voice.
* **Ethical Use:** A reminder to never input sensitive personal information and to be mindful of AI biases.

**Guide 2: Working with Git & Our Documentation Flow**
This is crucial. As you said, it's the backbone of the project. A beginner-friendly guide is key.

* **Why We Use Git & GitHub:** Explain it's our shared library and time machine, allowing for transparent, collaborative writing.
* **The Super Simple Start (No Command Line Needed):** Recommend using the **GitHub Desktop** application. This removes a major barrier for non-programmers.
* **Our Core Workflow (The 5 Steps):**
    1.  **Fork:** Make your own personal copy of a project.
    2.  **Clone:** Download that copy to your computer.
    3.  **Edit & Commit:** Make your changes and save them with a clear message.
    4.  **Push:** Upload your changes to your online copy.
    5.  **Pull Request:** Propose that your changes be added to the main project.
* **A Quick Guide to Markdown:** A simple cheat sheet of the most common formatting (headings, bold, lists, links).

#### **Level 3: Lab-Specific "Quick Start" Guides**

Once a contributor understands the culture and basic skills, they need a guide for the specific "lab" they want to join.

* **Quick Start: The Frameworks Lab**
    * *Audience:* Writers, researchers, thinkers.
    * *Content:* The standard template for a framework document, the peer-review process, and a guide on how to write effective cross-integration citations.
* **Quick Start: The Ecosystem Lab**
    * *Audience:* Communicators, community builders, networkers.
    * *Content:* Our communication guidelines (tone of voice), a template for reaching out to potential partners, and a guide to our strategic goals.
* **Quick Start: The Translations Lab**
    * *Audience:* Multilingual contributors.
    * *Content:* Style guide for translations (e.g., how to translate key terms like `Hearts`), the process for reviewing translations, and recommended tools (e.g., using DeepL for a first pass, followed by human refinement).
* **Quick Start: The Tech Lab**
    * *Audience:* Developers, designers, technical architects.
    * *Content:* You are right to identify this as a challenge. You can be transparent about this. The guide could state: *"This lab is in its infancy. Our immediate goal is to recruit a technical co-lead. The first task for this lab will be to co-create this very guide, starting with the technical specifications for the Love Ledger app."* This turns a limitation into an open invitation.

This layered approach ensures you can onboard Emil (and others from Gnistan) in a supportive way, starting with the vision and culture, then introducing the basic skills they need before they even have to choose a specific role. It also provides a clear path for more experienced contributors to jump in where they're needed most.
