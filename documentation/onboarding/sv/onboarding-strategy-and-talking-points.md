## Onboarding Strategy & Talking Points

Your weekly meeting at the "daglig sysselsättning" is the perfect venue for a gradual, human-centered onboarding.

* **Session 1: The Vision.**
    * Give them the printed "Part 1: The Why" documents.
    * Don't lecture. Frame it as a conversation: "I'm working on this project that I'm passionate about, and I wanted to share it with you. It’s about creating systems that value things like care and community. The core idea is our '`Hearts`-based' system, which is designed to recognize all kinds of work."
    * **Your 'ask':** "Would you be willing to read these and just tell me what you think next week? Your feedback and time are a valuable contribution, and the first one we can log in our system."

* **Session 2: Finding a Role.**
    * Start by asking for their thoughts. Listen more than you talk.
    * If they are interested, introduce the "Part 2: The How" documents.
    * Present the draft "Simple Role Description" and say: "This is just an idea I had based on our talks, but we can shape this together. What part of this sounds interesting to you? What would you want to change?"
    * This co-creation process is key. It makes them a partner from the beginning.

* **Session 3 and Beyond: The First Contribution.**
    * Once a starting "quest" is agreed upon (e.g., translating a page), set up their access to the shared digital workspace.
    * Walk them through logging their first `Hearts` on the Love Ledger for the time they've already spent learning about the project. This is a powerful, tangible moment that demonstrates the system works and that their time is valued, regardless of their background.

This approach is low-risk, respects their autonomy, and is a direct expression of the GGF's operating principles. You're not just offering them a task; you're inviting them to be a co-architect of a more meaningful system, starting with your own small team.
