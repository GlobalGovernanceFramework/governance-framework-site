# **An Overview of The Global Governance Frameworks Catalyst**

A warm welcome! This is a brief introduction to the organization you are now part of.

The Global Governance Frameworks Catalyst is a politically and religiously independent non-profit association registered in Sweden.

Our purpose is to function as a starting point and **catalyst** for a global network. This network's mission is to co-create, curate, and disseminate **open-source** governance frameworks.

Together, these frameworks constitute a proposal for a complete operating system for a sustainable, equitable, and resilient global civilization. Our goal is to promote systems built on shared stewardship and the principle of living in a healthy relationship ("Right Relationship") with each other and with the planet.

The organization rests on three foundational pillars:

* **Our legal foundation:** The association's statutes that comply with Swedish law.
* **Our way of working:** Our internal culture and operating system that guides how we collaborate.
* **Our mission:** Our strategic goals that provide us with a clear path forward.
