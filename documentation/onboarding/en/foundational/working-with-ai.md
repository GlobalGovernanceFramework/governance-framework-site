# Working with A.I. (Artificial Intelligence)

Welcome to our living guide on working with artificial intelligence (AI) within GGF. This guide combines structured methodology with personal experiences from actual usage. AI is a powerful tool â€“ a "co-pilot" that can help us think more clearly, create faster, and develop more deeply. But you are the pilot. Your ethics, your judgment, and your wisdom are irreplaceable.

This guide helps you get started and make the most of different AI models for GGF work.

## âœ¨ General Guidelines
1. **The task (prompt)**: Formulate what you want. Give the AI clear instructions. Describe what you want to accomplish. In rare cases, it can help to give the AI a role, but generally it's not needed and often works worse.
2. **The dialogue**: AI works best in conversation. The first response isn't always the best. Challenge, refine, and explore together.
3. **Verification**: Be alert to mistakes. Sometimes AI gets ideas that aren't true, or misinterprets instructions.
4. **Integration**: Refine as needed and give the material a more human tone, ethics, and quality.

## ðŸ¤– Specific A.I. Models

### [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com)

Gemini is excellent as an advisor. Make sure to select the 2.5 Pro model. It can be worth getting a PRO account (register with your email address) for frequent use. It costs â‚¬22 (about 250 SEK) per month (July 14, 2025).

**Process**
- Describe what you're working on
- Attach relevant documents if you have any
- Start the process; ask questions, request advice and help.

**Tips**: Documents cannot have the same name among attached files in a message. Make a temporary copy with a different name in these cases.

**Tips**: Gemini loses context in long conversations. It can help to save the first message(s) of the conversation so you can quickly restart fresh.

**Tips**: Gemini creates artifacts by default for documents that are cumbersome to get properly formatted copies of. It can help to ask Gemini not to create these at the beginning of the conversation.

### [Claude](https://claude.ai)

Claude is good for creating code, web pages, and solving programming problems. He is also very good at reviewing and asking questions, which can help with framework development. To work efficiently with Claude, you need a PRO account. It costs â‚¬15 (about 170 SEK) per month (July 14, 2025).

**Process**
- Create a project. Fill the project's 'project knowledge' with relevant documents. Make sure not to exceed the limit around 6% as indicated by 'Retrieving' and a dot in the project size gauge. If the limit is exceeded, Claude starts searching instead of having direct access to the documents.
- Specify what you want Claude to do. A conversation with Claude can unfortunately reach a max limit quite quickly if you have many documents.

**Tips**: Use Gemini to answer Claude's questions.
**Tips**: Use the 'Star' function to mark an important conversation and find it easier later. Click on the conversation name at the top of the browser to open the menu with 'Star'.

## [ChatGPT](https://chatgpt.com)

ChatGPT is good for asking quick questions and getting quick answers. A ChatGPT subscription is usually not necessary.

## [DeepSeek](www.deepseek.com)

DeepSeek, like ChatGPT, is good for asking quick questions. DeepSeek is completely free.
DeepSeek is good at finding aspects other AI miss, e.g., in framework development.

## [Perplexity](https://www.perplexity.ai)

An AI tool for research where source citations are always included.

- Good when you want to quickly find verifiable information.
- Balances creative AI with fact-based output.

## ðŸ§­ About Usage

Here are our guidelines:

* **Privacy:** Don't input sensitive or personal information if you're worried it might be misused. Treat AI conversations as public.
* **Critical thinking:** AI is trained on the internet â€“ including its flaws. Be source-critical.
* **Transparency:** Within GGF, AI is an integrated part of our modern work methodology, without putting special hats on either humans or AI.

## ðŸ§· Final Tips

* It's okay to experiment and make mistakes.
* Get to know each model â€“ they have different "personalities".
* Document what works for you and share with others.
