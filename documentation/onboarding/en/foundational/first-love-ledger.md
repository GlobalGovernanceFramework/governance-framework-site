# **Our First Love Ledger (A Simple Start)**

Within GGF, one of our core principles is that all meaningful contributions have value. To make this concrete, we use a **"Love Ledger"** where we log our contributions, which we measure in **`Hearts`**.

Before we have a complete technical system for this, we start in the simplest possible way: with a shared document.

## **Why do we have a Love Ledger?**

* **To value all work:** It ensures that all types of contributions – writing, research, translation, feedback, or supporting a colleague – become visible and valued.
* **For transparency:** It creates an open and honest foundation for how we distribute any financial resources in the future.
* **For motivation:** It gives us a concrete picture of the shared momentum we are building together.

## **How does it work? (Our simple system)**

1. **The tool:** We use a shared online document (e.g., Google Docs or a text file in our shared GitHub project) as our first Love Ledger.
2. **The structure:** The document is a simple table with four columns:
   | Date | Who | What (Short description of contribution) | Hearts (hours) |
   | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
   | 2025-07-15 | Björn | Wrote draft guide for Love Ledger | 1.5 |
   | 2025-07-16 | Emil | Read welcome kit and gave feedback | 2.0 |
3. **The process:**
   * When you have made a contribution, open the shared document.
   * Add a new row with today's date, your name, a short description of what you did, and an estimate of the time it took.
   * **One hour of contribution equals one `Heart`**. It's a simple starting point.

This system is a direct expression of our values: **radical autonomy** (you log your own contribution) and **radical transparency** (everyone can see everyone's contributions).
