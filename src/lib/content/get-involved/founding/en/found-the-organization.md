## Our Path to Formalization: Building a Durable Institution

The Global Governance Frameworks (GGF) initiative has grown from a research project into a comprehensive blueprint for global transformation. To achieve its mission, the project must now take the next critical step in its evolution: transitioning from a founder-led project into a durable, public-facing, and legally recognized organization.

### Our Current Status

Currently, the GGF is an independent research project driven by its founder, Björn Kenneth Holmström, with the analytical support of multiple AI systems. While this model has been effective for developing the core frameworks, a formal legal structure is now necessary to carry the work forward.

### Why We Need a Formal Organization

Registering as a formal non-profit entity (likely an `Ideell Förening` in Sweden) will unlock the project's full potential by providing:

1.  **Credibility and Legitimacy:** A formal structure is essential for building partnerships with universities, other NGOs, and governmental bodies.
2.  **Financial Sustainability:** It will allow the GGF to open a bank account, accept grants, and receive donations to fund its operations and development.
3.  **Legal Protection:** It creates a liability shield, separating the project's legal identity from its individual contributors.
4.  **Long-Term Durability:** It establishes a board and a governance structure to ensure the mission can continue and grow for decades to come, securing the GGF as a true public good.

### How You Can Help: A Call for Founding Members

We are seeking a small group of dedicated individuals with a belief in this mission to help form the initial founding board and guide the GGF through the process of formal registration. Your strategic guidance and expertise during this foundational moment will be invaluable.

We are particularly interested in individuals with experience in:

* Non-profit governance and management
* Swedish or international law
* Financial administration and fundraising for NGOs
* Strategic planning and organizational development

This is a unique opportunity to shape the foundation of an organization with a mission to address humanity's most pressing global challenges.
