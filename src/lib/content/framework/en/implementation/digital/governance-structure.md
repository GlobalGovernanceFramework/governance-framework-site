The Governance Structure operationalizes the Core Principles of the Digital Commons Framework, establishing a multi-layered, decentralized system to manage digital resources—data, software, knowledge, and infrastructure—as shared global commons. Inspired by historical commons governance, such as the Iroquois Confederacy’s consensus-based councils and Elinor Ostrom’s nested governance principles, it balances local autonomy with global coordination. From Aisha in Senegal proposing data policies via SMS to Carlos in Brazil auditing AI ethics, this structure empowers diverse communities while ensuring transparency, accountability, and resilience. Day-to-day operations involve continuous information flows between levels: Local Nodes share community needs and innovation through Regional Hubs, which coordinate resources and implementation, while the Global Council facilitates cross-regional learning and alignment. This living ecosystem of governance enables both bottom-up innovation and top-down coordination without rigid hierarchies. The governance structure’s checks and balances are visualized in the Framework Map available at globalgovernanceframework.org/visuals/governance-flow, illustrating how authority, accountability, and information flow between levels to prevent power concentration while enabling effective coordination. The next section, Key Components, details the digital assets governed by this system.

### <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The Governance Structure comprises interconnected layers—Local Citizen Nodes, Regional Digital Hubs, the Global Digital Commons Council, and the AI Governance Board—supported by dispute resolution and emergency protocols. It embodies decentralized authority, radical transparency, and direct participation, using tools like blockchain, SMS voting, and offline scribes to ensure inclusivity. Accountability is maintained through annual audits, recall processes, and public reporting, while conflict transformation processes, modeled on vTaiwan’s Pol.is, resolve tensions collaboratively. Success is measured by governance participation (50% of adults by 2035) and node autonomy (80% self-governing by 2035).

### <a id="global-digital-commons-council"></a>Global Digital Commons Council
The **Global Digital Commons Council** sets global standards for data sovereignty, open-source protocols, and ethical AI, ensuring alignment with the framework’s principles. Composed of representatives from citizen assemblies, regional tech hubs, and Indigenous knowledge networks, selected via stratified random sampling (e.g., 30% Global South, 20% Indigenous), it operates under holarchic governance, distributing authority across levels. For example, a council member from Rwanda ensures African data protocols reflect local needs.
- **Responsibilities**: Ratify policies (75% approval), oversee funding allocation, and coordinate cross-regional pilots.
- **Accountability**: Annual performance reviews by citizen assemblies (70% approval for reappointment); recall initiated by 60% of Regional Hubs for ineffective representatives, with replacement elections within 60 days.
- **Transparency**: Decisions logged on blockchain, publicly accessible via globalgovernanceframework.org.
Success is measured by policy ratification efficiency (90% of proposals resolved within 21 days by 2035).

### <a id="regional-digital-hubs"></a>Regional Digital Hubs
**Regional Digital Hubs** bridge local and global governance, adapting policies to cultural and economic contexts while managing decentralized infrastructure like data storage and mesh networks. In West Africa, a hub aligns Senegal’s node proposals with global standards, ensuring cultural relevance.
- **Responsibilities**: Facilitate node coordination, manage infrastructure, and conduct biannual audits.
- **Decision-Making**: Use ranked-choice voting for disputes (66% consensus required).
- **Accountability**: Biannual audits by independent auditors, with public reports on globalgovernanceframework.org; hub leaders removable by 75% node vote.
- **Inclusivity**: Support multilingual platforms and offline tools, enabling participation from urban Singapore to rural Bangladesh.
Success is measured by infrastructure uptime (90% by 2035) and cultural adaptation (80% of nodes report local relevance by 2035).

### <a id="local-citizen-nodes"></a>Local Citizen Nodes
**Local Citizen Nodes** are community-driven bodies where citizens like Fatima in Bangladesh propose and vote on policies using SMS or paper ballots. Modeled on Athenian assemblies and Indigenous councils, nodes ensure direct participation and cultural autonomy. **Intergenerational Governance**: Nodes ensure age diversity through youth councils (members aged 16-25) that hold advisory status and can propose policies directly to node assemblies. In Rwanda, young participants contributed critical insights on educational resources, leading to improved Knowledge Commons access. By 2030, all nodes aim to achieve at least 25% youth participation in governance processes.
- **Responsibilities**: Propose local policies (66% majority, 50% quorum), manage community data, and engage in global deliberations.
- **Tools**: Digital platforms, SMS voting with verification codes, or offline scribes for low-resource areas.
- **Accountability**: Quarterly community reviews; facilitators removable by 60% node vote.
- **Example**: A node in Canada, led by Lila, implements Indigenous data protocols, voting via a solar-powered mesh network.
Success is measured by participation rates (50% of adults annually by 2035) and node autonomy (80% self-governing by 2035).

### <a id="ai-governance-board"></a>AI Governance Board
The **AI Governance Board** ensures AI systems are transparent, auditable, and aligned with human values, preventing bias and misuse. Comprising ethicists, technologists, and citizen representatives, it enforces standards through audits and sanctions.
- **Responsibilities**: Audit AI models, enforce ethical guidelines, and integrate with the Cyber Conflict Tribunal for violations.
- **Accountability**: Annual ethics audits by external experts; board members replaceable by Global Council with 75% approval.
- **Example**: In Brazil, Carlos contributes to an audit revealing bias in an AI model, triggering retraining and public reporting.
Success is measured by AI compliance rates (95% of models meeting ethical standards by 2035).

### <a id="dispute-resolution"></a>Dispute Resolution
The **Cyber Conflict Tribunal** mediates disputes across governance layers, transforming conflicts into opportunities for collaboration, inspired by vTaiwan’s consensus-building tools. Clear escalation pathways ensure timely resolution:
- **Local Disputes**: Handled by Regional Digital Hubs via arbitration within 14 days, using ranked-choice voting.
- **Regional Disputes**: Escalated to the Global Digital Commons Council within 21 days, with 75% approval for binding decisions.
- **Global Disputes**: Resolved by the Tribunal within 30 days, ratified by citizen assemblies (75% approval).
- **Example**: In Senegal, a dispute over data priorities (health vs. education) is resolved through a node-hosted dialogue, facilitated by the West Africa Hub, resulting in a hybrid policy and increased community trust.
- **Accountability**: Outcomes documented in Field-Test Logbooks, with lessons shared globally to refine processes.
Success is measured by resolution efficiency (90% of disputes resolved within timelines by 2035).

### <a id="emergency-governance-protocols"></a>Emergency Governance Protocols
In crisis situations affecting digital commons (e.g., major cyber attacks or infrastructure failures), an expedited decision-making process activates:
- Regional Hubs can implement temporary measures within 24 hours, requiring 60% approval.
- The Global Council can coordinate cross-regional responses within 48 hours.
- All emergency actions are documented on blockchain for post-crisis review.
- Normal governance resumes after crisis resolution, with mandatory review of emergency actions.
This ensures resilience while maintaining accountability even during disruptions. Success is measured by crisis response efficiency (90% of emergencies addressed within 48 hours by 2035).
