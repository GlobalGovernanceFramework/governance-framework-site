# Youth Engagement Guide: Digital Commons Framework

**Estimated Reading Time**: 8 minutes

**Purpose**: This guide empowers youth (ages 16-25) to actively participate in the *Digital Commons Framework*, fostering leadership in governing shared digital resources—data, software, knowledge, and infrastructure. Designed for young people globally, from rural to urban settings, it offers accessible steps to join or start Local Citizen Nodes, influence digital policies, and access resources, requiring minimal technical skills or resources. Rooted in inclusive governance principles inspired by historical commons (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy) and aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 4, 10, 16), it ensures youth voices shape equitable, sustainable, and culturally inclusive digital systems.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The *Digital Commons Framework* transforms digital resources into shared global commons, governed by communities through decentralized, transparent systems. Youth are vital to this vision, bringing innovation, energy, and perspectives to shape a digital future that prioritizes equity, sustainability, and cultural inclusion. This guide equips young people to join Local Citizen Nodes, start Youth Councils, and lead projects, using tools like SMS voting or paper ballots to ensure accessibility. It aims for:

- **Youth Participation**: 25% youth engagement in governance by 2030.
- **Equitable Access**: 90% global access to digital resources by 2035.
- **Sustainability**: 80% renewable energy for digital infrastructure by 2035.
- **Cultural Inclusion**: 100 languages, including Indigenous protocols, by 2035.

**Youth Benefits**:
- Influence policies on AI, data, and education.
- Access tools for learning, innovation, and entrepreneurship.
- Build leadership skills and global networks.
- Protect cultural heritage and local priorities.

## <a id="why-youth-matter"></a>Why Youth Matter
Youth are uniquely positioned to drive the Digital Commons Framework:

- **Digital Natives**: 85% of youth globally use digital tools, offering insights into ethical tech use.
- **Future Leaders**: By 2035, youth will dominate decision-making; early involvement builds capacity.
- **Innovation Drivers**: Youth-led startups and open-source projects fuel economic growth.
- **Diversity Advocates**: Youth prioritize inclusion, ensuring marginalized voices are heard.
- **Global Reach**: 1.8 billion youth worldwide can amplify the framework’s impact.

**Challenges Addressed**:
- **Digital Divide**: 2.7 billion lack access; youth-led nodes bridge this with offline tools.
- **Corporate Dominance**: 5 firms control 72% of cloud infrastructure; youth advocate for decentralization.
- **Climate Impact**: Digital systems emit 5% of emissions; youth push for renewable energy.

**Policy Relevance**:
- Aligns with SDG 4 (Quality Education), SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 16 (Strong Institutions).
- Supports national youth empowerment and digital inclusion strategies.

## <a id="getting-involved"></a>Getting Involved
Youth can join existing nodes or start youth-focused initiatives, requiring only enthusiasm and basic tools (e.g., a phone, notebook).

1. **Join a Local Citizen Node**:
  - Find nodes via globalgovernanceframework.org/nodes
  - Attend meetings, propose ideas, or vote on policies (66% majority, 50% quorum).
  - Example: Kenya’s Amina joined a node, proposing AI tools for education access.
2. **Participate in Governance**:
  - Suggest policies (e.g., ethical AI, data privacy) via SMS, paper, or digital platforms.
  - Vote using SMS Voting Template or paper ballots, accessible offline.
  - Example: Brazil’s Lucas voted to prioritize climate data for youth-led farming.
3. **Engage Globally**:
  - Share ideas with Regional Hubs or Global Council via youth representatives.
  - Join monthly Youth Call-Ins (first Monday, 10:00 UTC).
  - Example: Rwanda’s Sarah represented her node at the Global Council, shaping data protocols.

**Inclusivity**:
- Tools for non-literate youth (e.g., audio proposals, scribes).
- Multilingual platforms (50 languages by 2030).
- Accessibility for disabilities (braille, audio guides).

**Metrics**: 25% youth participation annually by 2030; 80% nodes with youth members by 2035.

## <a id="starting-a-youth-council"></a>Starting a Youth Council
Youth Councils within nodes amplify young voices, requiring minimal setup.

1. **Form a Group (1 week)**:
  - Gather 5+ youth (diverse in gender, background, skills).
  - Discuss local digital needs (e.g., education tools, cultural preservation).
  - Example: Canada’s council focused on Indigenous knowledge archives.
2. **Register with Node/Hub (1 week)**:
  - Submit goals via email (globalgovernanceframework@gmail.com), or node meeting.
  - Receive Youth Starter Kit (templates, guides).
3. **Hold First Meeting (1 day)**:
  - Use Youth Quickstart Guide (Appendix G) to set priorities.
  - Assign roles (e.g., facilitator, outreach lead).
  - Example: India’s council met in a park, prioritizing mobility data.
4. **Launch a Project (1-2 months)**:
  - Propose a pilot (e.g., open-source app, data access).
  - Vote on plans (66% majority, 50% quorum).
  - Example: Senegal’s council launched an SMS-based health app.
5. **Connect with Others**:
  - Share outcomes with node and Regional Hub.
  - Join global Youth Network for collaboration.
  - Example: Brazil’s council shared app code with 5 nodes.

**Timeline**: Council setup takes 2 weeks; projects start within 1-2 months.

**Requirements**:
- No tech skills needed; basic literacy sufficient.
- Minimal costs ($0-$100, e.g., phone credit, notebooks).
- Support from nodes/Hubs for training, tools.

## <a id="accessing-digital-resources"></a>Accessing Digital Resources
Youth can access five shared digital assets to support education, innovation, and advocacy.

1. **Open Data Commons**:
  - Access datasets (health, climate, education) via SMS, tablets, or offline archives.
  - Example: Kenya’s youth used climate data for urban gardening projects.
2. **Open-Source Software Ecosystem**:
  - Download apps (e.g., learning, coding) from decentralized repositories.
  - Example: Brazil’s youth built a farming app, shared globally.
3. **Shared Digital Infrastructure**:
  - Use mesh networks or cloud systems for connectivity.
  - Example: Rwanda’s youth connected schools via solar-powered networks.
4. **Ethical AI Models**:
  - Access AI tools (e.g., tutoring, job matching) with community oversight.
  - Example: Singapore’s youth deployed AI for education, audited for bias.
5. **Knowledge Commons**:

## <a id="youth-led-projects"></a>Youth-Led Projects
Youth can lead impactful projects, supported by nodes and Hubs.

- **Education Platforms**: Develop open-source learning apps (e.g., math tutorials in 10 languages).
- **Climate Solutions**: Use climate data for local sustainability projects (e.g., urban farms).
