Appendix A: Pilot Onboarding provides a practical guide for communities to establish and operate pilot Local Citizen Nodes, bringing the Digital Commons Framework to life. Rooted in historical commons practices, such as the Iroquois Confederacy’s community-led alliances and Elinor Ostrom’s principles of collective governance, this section outlines five actionable steps to launch pilots, from forming teams to evaluating impact. Drawing on the Implementation Roadmap, Operational Toolkits, and Call to Action, it equips stakeholders like Priya, Kwame, and Aroha from User Archetypes to initiate nodes, fostering cross-commons synergies with environmental and economic systems. By following this guide, you can transform your community, as seen in Case Studies like Kenya’s agricultural AI node. The next section, Appendix B, provides additional resources for scaling pilots.

### <a id="overview"></a>Overview
Pilot Onboarding enables communities to launch Local Citizen Nodes as part of the framework’s pilot phase (2026–2028), per Implementation Roadmap. This guide leverages Operational Toolkits, Funding Mechanisms, and Legal Interoperability to ensure inclusive, effective onboarding. Success would be measured by pilot activation (100 pilot nodes by 2028), community engagement (70% participation by 2028), and early impact (60% of pilots reporting benefits by 2028), per Metrics for Success. Inspired by Case Studies and supported by Regional Digital Hubs, this process empowers you to co-create a decentralized, equitable digital future, addressing local needs while advancing global resource justice.

### <a id="step-1-form-a-pilot-node-team"></a>Step 1: Form a Pilot Node Team
Gather a diverse team to lead your pilot node, reflecting your community’s needs and User Archetypes.
- **Action**: Recruit 5–15 members, including Community Leaders (e.g., Priya), Developers (e.g., Kwame), and Policymakers (e.g., Mei), via community dialogues or social media (#DigitalCommons). Use engagement kits from globalgovernanceframework.org/engage to host a kickoff meeting by Q1 2026, per Operational Toolkits. Maria from a Senegal pilot said, “Our diverse team made everyone feel included.”
- **Inclusivity**: Include youth, elders, and low-resource members, with oral recruitment options for accessibility.
- **Cross-Commons**: Engage environmental advocates to link node goals to local sustainability, e.g., climate data sharing.
- **Example**: Like Aroha’s New Zealand node, your team could include Māori elders to prioritize cultural preservation, per Case Studies.
- **Deliverable**: A team roster submitted to globalgovernanceframework.org/join by Q1 2026.
Success would be measured by team diversity (50% non-technical members by 2026), per Metrics for Success.

### <a id="step-2-assess-community-needs"></a>Step 2: Assess Community Needs
Identify your community’s priorities to align node activities with local challenges.
- **Action**: Conduct surveys using SMS tools (text NEEDS to 12345) and offline forms, guided by Digital Commons Impact Assessments, per Legal Interoperability. Host workshops with dialogue guides to reach 60% community input by Q2 2026, per Operational Toolkits. Farmer Wanjiku from a Kenya pilot noted, “Sharing our needs shaped our AI tools.”
- **Inclusivity**: Multilingual surveys (20 languages by 2026) and low-literacy formats would ensure broad participation.
- **Cross-Commons**: Assess needs like local food security to connect with economic commons, e.g., job training programs.
- **Example**: Like Priya’s India node, you could prioritize urban mobility, reducing commute times by 20% by 2030, per Case Studies.
- **Deliverable**: A needs assessment report uploaded to globalgovernanceframework.org/assess by Q2 2026.
Success would be measured by community input (60% participation by 2026), per Metrics for Success.

### <a id="step-3-access-onboarding-resources"></a>Step 3: Access Onboarding Resources
Secure tools, funding, and mentorship to support your pilot node.
- **Action**: Download node setup guides and budget templates from globalgovernanceframework.org/resources. Apply for $5,000–$50,000 in crowdfunding or automation taxes via globalgovernanceframework.org/fund by Q3 2026, per Funding Mechanisms. Connect with a Regional Digital Hub for virtual mentorship, as Lena’s Germany node did, per Case Studies.
- **Inclusivity**: Offline USB guides and SMS funding applications (text FUND to 12345) would support low-connectivity areas.
- **Cross-Commons**: Fund environmental projects, like energy-efficient servers, to link with sustainability commons.
- **Example**: Like Kwame’s Kenya node, you could secure $75,000 for AI tools, boosting yields by 30% by 2030, per Case Studies.
- **Deliverable**: A funding plan and resource list submitted to globalgovernanceframework.org/resources by Q3 2026.
Success would be measured by resource access (80% of pilots funded by 2026), per Metrics for Success.

### <a id="step-4-establish-governance-and-tools"></a>Step 4: Establish Governance and Tools
Set up governance structures and deploy technical tools for your node.
- **Action**: Adopt liquid democracy via Decidim platforms, requiring 66% approval for decisions, per Governance Structure. Deploy federated storage (IPFS) and AI auditing tools from globalgovernanceframework.org/code, ensuring compliance with Data Sovereignty Agreements (DSAs), per Legal Interoperability. Train 50% of members using tutorials by Q4 2026, per Operational Toolkits. Carlos from a Brazil pilot said, “Our governance tools empowered every voice.”
- **Inclusivity**: SMS voting and offline playbooks would ensure universal participation.
- **Cross-Commons**: Use governance to manage economic commons, like local currency systems.
- **Example**: Like Juan’s Mexico node, you could deploy educational platforms, improving test scores by 20% by 2031, per Case Studies.
- **Deliverable**: A governance charter and tool deployment log submitted to globalgovernanceframework.org/setup by Q4 2026.
Success would be measured by governance adoption (70% of pilots operational by 2026), per Metrics for Success.

### <a id="step-5-launch-and-evaluate"></a>Step 5: Launch and Evaluate
Launch your pilot node and assess its early impact to refine operations.
- **Action**: Host a launch event by Q1 2027, using engagement kits to achieve 70% community participation, per Operational Toolkits. Evaluate impact with audit checklists and Pol.is feedback platforms, targeting 60% reporting benefits by 2028, per Metrics for Success. Share results at globalgovernanceframework.org/impact for third-party verification, per Metrics for Success. Aisha from a Senegal pilot shared, “Our launch united us, and evaluation kept us honest.”
- **Inclusivity**: Offline feedback forms and oral reporting would include low-literacy participants.
- **Cross-Commons**: Evaluate environmental impacts, like reduced emissions from mobility solutions.
- **Example**: Like Lena’s Germany node, your launch could reduce energy costs by 15% by 2030, per Case Studies.
- **Deliverable**: An impact report submitted to globalgovernanceframework.org/evaluate by Q2 2028.
Success would be measured by early impact (60% of pilots reporting benefits by 2028), per Metrics for Success.
