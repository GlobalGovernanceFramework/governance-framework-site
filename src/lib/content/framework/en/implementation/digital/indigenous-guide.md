# Indigenous Data Stewardship Guide: Digital Commons Framework

**Estimated Reading Time**: 10 minutes

**Purpose**: This guide empowers Indigenous communities to steward their data, knowledge, and cultural resources within the *Digital Commons Framework*, ensuring sovereignty, cultural respect, and equitable participation. Grounded in Indigenous governance principles (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy’s consensus model) and global frameworks like the CARE Principles for Indigenous Data Governance, it provides practical steps to join or start Local Citizen Nodes, govern digital resources, and protect heritage. Aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 10, 16, 17), it supports low-resource settings with accessible tools (e.g., oral protocols, paper ballots) and aims to integrate Indigenous protocols into 100% of framework activities by 2035.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The *Digital Commons Framework* reimagines digital resources—data, software, knowledge, and infrastructure—as shared global commons, governed by decentralized, community-led systems. Indigenous communities are central to this vision, stewarding their data and cultural knowledge with sovereignty and respect. This guide outlines how to engage with the framework, ensuring Indigenous voices shape digital governance while protecting heritage. It emphasizes:

- **Data Sovereignty**: 100% community control over Indigenous data by 2035.
- **Cultural Respect**: Indigenous protocols in 100% of framework activities by 2035.
- **Inclusivity**: 90% global access to digital resources, prioritizing Indigenous communities.
- **Participation**: 20% Indigenous representation in global governance by 2035.

**Community Benefits**:
- Protect and share cultural knowledge on Indigenous terms.
- Access health, education, and environmental data for community priorities.
- Influence global digital policies through nodes and councils.
- Build resilience with decentralized tools like mesh networks.

**Policy Relevance**:
- Aligns with SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities), SDG 16 (Strong Institutions), SDG 17 (Partnerships).
- Supports UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and CARE Principles.

## <a id="why-indigenous-stewardship-matters"></a>Why Indigenous Stewardship Matters
Indigenous communities bring unique perspectives and traditional knowledge to digital governance, addressing critical challenges:

- **Cultural Preservation**: 50% of 7,000 Indigenous languages risk extinction by 2100; digital archives can protect them.
- **Data Exploitation**: 80% of Indigenous data is controlled by non-Indigenous entities, risking misuse.
- **Digital Divide**: 2.7 billion lack digital access, disproportionately affecting Indigenous communities.
- **Environmental Stewardship**: Indigenous lands protect 80% of global biodiversity; data can enhance conservation.

**Benefits**:
- **Sovereignty**: Control data usage, ensuring alignment with cultural values.
- **Equity**: Prioritize access for remote and marginalized Indigenous groups.
- **Global Influence**: Shape ethical AI, data, and infrastructure standards.
- **Resilience**: Use decentralized tools to maintain access during crises.

**Challenges Addressed**:
- Corporate dominance (5 firms control 72% of cloud infrastructure).
- Environmental harm (digital systems emit 5% of global emissions).
- Exclusion from digital governance (less than 5% Indigenous representation in tech policy).

## <a id="core-principles"></a>Core Principles
Four principles, rooted in Indigenous governance and CARE (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics), guide stewardship:

1. **Data Sovereignty**:
  - Communities control access, use, and storage of their data.
  - Protocols reflect local customs (e.g., oral consent, elder approval).
  - Example: Māori node set data access rules via hapū consensus.
2. **Cultural Respect**:
  - Protect sacred knowledge; restrict access as needed.
  - Use culturally appropriate formats (e.g., oral archives, visual storytelling).
  - Example: Canada’s node archived stories with elder-guided protocols.
3. **Collective Benefit**:
  - Data and resources prioritize community well-being (e.g., health, education).
  - Share benefits equitably, with 80% reinvested locally by 2035.
  - Example: Senegal’s Indigenous node used climate data for sustainable farming.
4. **Ethical Responsibility**:
  - Ensure transparency, fairness, and accountability in governance.
  - Audit systems for bias and cultural misalignment (95% compliance by 2035).
  - Example: Australia’s node audited AI for cultural bias, ensuring fairness.

**Alignment**:
- Builds on CARE Principles, OCAP (Ownership, Control, Access, Possession), and UNDRIP.
- Adaptable to diverse Indigenous governance models.

## <a id="joining-or-starting-a-node"></a>Joining or Starting a Node
Indigenous communities can join existing nodes or start their own, with minimal resources.

1. **Join a Local Citizen Node (1-2 weeks)**:
  - Find nodes via globalgovernanceframework.org/nodes or text INDIGENOUS to 12345.
  - Attend meetings, share priorities, or vote on policies (66% majority, 50% quorum).
  - Example: Navajo Nation joined a node to steward environmental data.
2. **Start an Indigenous Node (2-4 weeks)**:
  - Gather 5+ community members (elders, youth, leaders).
  - Discuss digital needs (e.g., cultural archives, health data).
  - Register via SMS (text JOIN to 12345), email (globalgovernanceframework@gmail.com), or Regional Hub.
  - Receive Indigenous Starter Kit (protocols, templates).
  - Example: Canada’s Cree node started with 10 members, focusing on language preservation.
3. **Set Up Governance (1-2 weeks)**:
  - Use Indigenous Quickstart Guide (Appendix I) to define protocols.
  - Assign roles (e.g., elder advisor, youth liaison).
  - Example: Māori node used oral consensus for governance setup.

**Ultra-Lightweight Option**: Communities with basic internet access can implement an extremely accessible digital commons using GitHub and AI tools, requiring only minimal resources (~$15/year). See Appendix F: Ultra-Lightweight Digital Implementation for a step-by-step guide to creating a permanent, accessible digital presence for your Indigenous knowledge with full sovereignty.

4. **Launch a Pilot (1-3 months)**:
  - Choose a project (e.g., archive stories, access health data).
  - Vote on protocols (e.g., data access rules) using oral, paper, or SMS methods.
  - Example: Australia’s node piloted a cultural archive with elder approval.

**Timeline**: Node setup takes 2-4 weeks; pilots start within 1-3 months.

**Requirements**:
- No tech skills needed; oral or written literacy sufficient.
- Minimal costs ($0-$100, e.g., notebooks, phone credit).
- Support from Regional Hubs for training, tools.

## <a id="stewarding-digital-resources"></a>Stewarding Digital Resources
Nodes steward five digital assets, prioritizing Indigenous needs and protocols.

1. **Open Data Commons**:
  - Access health, climate, or education data with community consent.
  - Use federated storage to ensure sovereignty.
  - Example: Navajo node used climate data for water management, with elder approval.
2. **Open-Source Software Ecosystem**:
  - Develop or access apps (e.g., language learning) with cultural alignment.
  - Example: Māori node built a te reo Māori app, shared with 5 nodes.
3. **Shared Digital Infrastructure**:
  - Use mesh networks or cloud systems, prioritizing renewable energy (80% by 2035).
  - Example: Canada’s node connected schools via solar-powered networks.
4. **Ethical AI Models**:
  - Access AI tools (e.g., translation, health prediction) audited for cultural bias.
  - Example: Australia’s node deployed AI for land management, ensuring fairness.
5. **Knowledge Commons**:
  - Archive stories, songs, or practices with restricted access as needed.
  - Example: Canada’s node archived 450 Cree narratives, accessible only with consent.

**Stewardship Methods**:
- Low-tech: Oral protocols, paper records.
- High-tech: Tablets, digital archives with encryption.
- Support: Hubs provide training, hardware grants.

**Metrics**: 100% data sovereignty, 80% resource access by 2035.
