The Planetary Health Accord requires transformative financing mechanisms that prioritize health equity over profit, ensure sustainable funding flows, and maintain community control over resource allocation. This comprehensive financing framework combines innovative revenue generation with equitable distribution mechanisms, creating a global health economy that serves planetary well-being rather than extractive profit-making. All financing mechanisms include robust accountability measures and prioritize the Global South, marginalized communities, and frontline health workers.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Norway's Global Health Initiative** demonstrates successful innovative health financing. Since 2006, Norway has contributed over $6 billion to global health through creative mechanisms including debt-for-health swaps with Pakistan and innovative financing facilities. The **International Finance Facility for Immunisation (IFFIm)** uses future donor commitments to raise immediate funds, accelerating vaccine access while maintaining transparent accountability. This approach has prevented over 10 million deaths while demonstrating how rich countries can contribute fairly to global health equity.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Caribbean Health Sovereignty Fund** (2028-2030) successfully implemented community-controlled health financing across 15 island nations. Hurricane recovery debt was restructured into coral reef restoration and climate-adaptive health infrastructure projects, generating $400 million in health investments. Community health assemblies managed 70% of fund allocation, prioritizing traditional medicine integration and youth health leadership development. Microdonation APIs integrated with regional banking systems enabled diaspora communities to directly support local health initiatives, creating sustainable funding streams independent of external donors.
