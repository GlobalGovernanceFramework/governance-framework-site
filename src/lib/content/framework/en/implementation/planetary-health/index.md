In an era of pandemics, climate health crises, and global health inequity, the *Planetary Health Accord Implementation Framework* provides a transformative blueprint for equitable, resilient, and sustainable healthcare for all. Rooted in One Health principles, technological innovation, and global solidarity, it empowers communities, healthcare workers, and policymakers from rural clinics to international health organizations. This master index serves as the entry point to the framework, linking its sections and inviting stakeholders to co-create a world where health is a fundamental right for every person, community, and ecosystem.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The framework is a comprehensive plan to establish integrated planetary health systems that recognize health as a fundamental right intertwined with planetary well-being. It integrates human, animal, and environmental health through strategic objectives from universal healthcare access to climate-health preparedness, with phased implementation strategies and community-centered monitoring. Aligned with the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), WHO Constitution, Paris Agreement, and indigenous health sovereignty principles, it prioritizes equity, innovation, and global collaboration. Practical tools, Health Sanctuary pilot programs, and innovative financing mechanisms ensure accessibility and impact across diverse health systems globally.

**Purpose**: To ensure equitable, resilient, and sustainable healthcare for every person, community, and ecosystem by 2035, establishing universal health access, pandemic-proof systems, and climate-adaptive care delivery.

**Key Features**:
- Global Health Equity Council with enforceable powers and inclusive representation
- AI-driven federated learning systems with bias auditing and transparency standards
- Blockchain-based patient-controlled health records with offline-first solutions
- Community Health Legions trained with cultural competency and trauma-informed care
- Global Health Solidarity Fund with tiered financing and debt-for-health swaps
- Open-source essential medicines commons and crowdsourced drug discovery
- One Health surveillance integrating human, animal, and environmental monitoring
- Youth-led advisory structures and intergenerational health justice frameworks
