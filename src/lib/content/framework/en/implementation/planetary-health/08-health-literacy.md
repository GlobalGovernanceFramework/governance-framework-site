The Planetary Health Accord recognizes that health literacy must be culturally grounded, community-controlled, and accessible to all people regardless of education level, language, or cultural background. This comprehensive approach moves beyond top-down health education to community-driven knowledge sharing that honors traditional wisdom while integrating modern health science. All health literacy initiatives prioritize community sovereignty, cultural safety, and the understanding that effective health communication respects diverse ways of knowing and learning.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Ethiopia's Health Extension Program** demonstrates successful community-based health literacy at scale. Ethiopia trained 38,000 **Health Extension Workers** who live and work in their own communities, providing health education in local languages while respecting traditional practices. The program achieved significant improvements in maternal mortality, child nutrition, and infectious disease prevention by integrating modern health knowledge with traditional community structures and cultural practices. Community ownership and cultural competency were key to the program's success in reaching rural populations.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Sami Health Literacy Sovereignty Initiative** (2026-2030) successfully integrated traditional Arctic health knowledge with modern health education across Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Sami elders worked with youth to create bilingual health education materials incorporating traditional knowledge about Arctic plants, seasonal health patterns, and reindeer herding health practices. Digital storytelling combined traditional oral narratives with modern health messaging, achieving 95% health literacy while strengthening Sami language and cultural identity. The program became a model for indigenous health literacy programs worldwide.
