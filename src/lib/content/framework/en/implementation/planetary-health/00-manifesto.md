The Planetary Health Accord stands as humanity's bold declaration that health is not merely the absence of disease, but the flourishing of all life on Earth. In an age where pandemics cross borders in hours, climate change reshapes disease patterns, and health inequities persist across and within nations, we recognize that our individual health is inseparable from the health of our communities, our ecosystems, and our planet.

## <a id="our-purpose"></a>Our Purpose

We exist to transform the fundamental understanding of health from a narrow, individual concern to a comprehensive, planetary responsibility. The Planetary Health Accord recognizes that:

- **Health transcends borders**: Viruses, environmental toxins, and climate impacts ignore political boundaries, demanding coordinated global responses
- **Equity is essential**: No one is truly healthy while others suffer from preventable diseases, lack access to care, or live in degraded environments  
- **Nature is our foundation**: Human health depends on thriving ecosystems, stable climate systems, and biodiversity preservation
- **Technology must serve all**: Digital innovations in health must bridge divides, not widen them, ensuring benefits reach the most vulnerable first
- **Communities hold wisdom**: Local knowledge, traditional healing practices, and community-based solutions are essential partners to global health systems

**Core Principle**: To ensure equitable, resilient, and sustainable healthcare for every person, community, and ecosystem, recognizing health as a fundamental right intertwined with planetary well-being.

## <a id="our-audience"></a>Our Audience

This Accord speaks to all inhabitants of Earth—humans, governments, corporations, and civil society—united in our shared responsibility to protect and promote health across borders, species, and generations.

### We Call Upon Governments to:
- Enforce equitable health standards that prioritize marginalized communities
- Invest in One Health surveillance systems connecting human, animal, and environmental monitoring
- Champion transparent healthcare financing and universal access initiatives
- Lead international cooperation on pandemic preparedness and climate health adaptation

### We Call Upon Corporations to:
- Innovate transparently with open-source solutions that benefit global health commons
- Eliminate profit-driven barriers to essential medicines and healthcare technologies
- Adopt planetary health impact assessments for all business activities
- Partner with communities to co-create culturally appropriate health technologies

### We Call Upon Communities to:
- Engage actively in health governance through Community Health Legions and participatory decision-making
- Share traditional knowledge and healing practices while protecting cultural sovereignty
- Advocate for health equity and environmental justice in local, national, and global forums
- Build resilient health systems rooted in mutual aid and collective care

### We Call Upon Health Workers to:
- Champion community-centered care that addresses social determinants of health
- Integrate planetary health perspectives into clinical practice and public health work
- Lead with cultural humility, trauma-informed approaches, and anti-oppression principles
- Advocate for health system transformation that serves justice and healing

### We Call Upon Global Institutions to:
- Restructure financing mechanisms to prioritize health equity over profit
- Support technology transfer and capacity building in the Global South
- Facilitate knowledge sharing through global health commons platforms
- Enforce accountability mechanisms for planetary health commitments

## <a id="our-call-to-action"></a>Our Call to Action

**The time for incremental change has passed.** Climate change accelerates, pandemics emerge with increasing frequency, and health inequities compound daily. We demand transformative action aligned with the urgency of our planetary health crisis.

### Immediate Actions (0-12 months):
- **Governments**: Commit to Health Sanctuary nation pilot programs and Global Health Equity Council participation
- **Companies**: Begin transparent R&D cost disclosure and open-source essential medicine development
- **Communities**: Form Community Health Legions and establish local health resilience networks
- **Individuals**: Advocate for planetary health integration in local health systems and educational curricula

### Systemic Changes (1-5 years):
- Establish enforceable global health governance with meaningful community representation
- Deploy AI-driven health systems with bias auditing and community oversight
- Implement blockchain-based patient-controlled health records with offline accessibility
- Launch global health solidarity funding mechanisms with debt-for-health swaps

### Transformational Goals (5-15 years):
- Achieve universal health coverage rooted in planetary health principles
- Build pandemic-proof surveillance systems integrating One Health approaches
- Establish climate-adaptive healthcare delivery in all vulnerable regions
- Create regenerative health systems that heal communities and ecosystems simultaneously

## <a id="our-vision"></a>Our Vision

We envision a world where:

**Every person** has access to quality healthcare regardless of geography, identity, or economic status, supported by Community Health Legions trained in cultural competency and trauma-informed care.

**Every community** participates meaningfully in health governance through inclusive councils, youth advisory boards, and indigenous sovereignty protections that honor traditional healing wisdom.

**Every health system** integrates human, animal, and environmental health monitoring through One Health surveillance networks that prevent pandemics before they start.

**Every innovation** serves global health equity through open-source platforms, transparent pricing, and technology designed with and for marginalized communities.

**Every crisis** triggers coordinated responses through mobile clinics, AI triage systems, and health corridors that reach the most vulnerable within 72 hours.

**Every decision** considers impacts on future generations through intergenerational health justice frameworks and rights of nature integration.

This is not utopian dreaming—it is urgent necessity. The tools, knowledge, and resources exist. What we need now is the collective will to implement them with the speed and scale our planetary health crisis demands.

**Join us.** The Planetary Health Accord begins with each of us choosing to see health as our shared responsibility and planetary flourishing as our common destiny. Together, we can heal ourselves and our world.
