The Planetary Health Accord recognizes that transformative health systems change requires mechanisms that cut across all sectors, linking governance, technology, financing, and community empowerment in integrated approaches. These cross-cutting mechanisms address systemic challenges that cannot be solved within single sectors, ensuring that health transformation serves justice, equity, and planetary well-being. All cross-cutting mechanisms prioritize community sovereignty, cultural competency, and the understanding that lasting change requires coordinated action across multiple systems simultaneously.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Brazil's Generic Medicine and Technology Transfer Policy** demonstrates successful cross-cutting pharmaceutical reform. Brazil's **Lei de Genéricos** (Generic Medicine Law) combined mandatory generic substitution with local manufacturing requirements and technology transfer agreements with multinationals. The policy integrated patent reform, industrial development, and health access, reducing medicine costs by 40% while building domestic pharmaceutical capacity. Brazil's **Farmanguinhos** public laboratory produces essential medicines while pharmaceutical companies must transfer technology to maintain market access, showing how coordinated policy can serve both health equity and economic development.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **African Health Innovation Sovereignty Compact** (2028-2033) successfully created the first continent-wide cross-cutting health transformation mechanism. Fifty-four African nations coordinated pharmaceutical transparency, traditional medicine preservation, and technology transfer through community-controlled governance structures. Traditional healers from different African cultures collaborated to create standardized traditional medicine protocols while maintaining cultural sovereignty. Youth innovation councils linked urban technology hubs with rural traditional knowledge centers, creating hybrid innovations like AI-assisted traditional diagnostic systems and blockchain-tracked traditional medicine supply chains. The compact achieved pharmaceutical price reductions of 60% while preserving traditional knowledge and building regional technological capacity.
