## Why Join? (Meta-Governance Manifesto)

Meta-Governance is not control—it's coordination. It’s how your domain framework:
- Gains legitimacy by aligning with planetary ethics
- Resolves policy conflicts before they escalate
- Taps into powerful, AI-assisted shared tools
- Secures future relevance across shifting timescales
- Helps shape the grammar of global cooperation

Whether you're ready to observe, contribute, or lead, there's a seat at the table. Your voice shapes the architecture. Let’s build the future—together.
