## Value Proposition for Participating Frameworks

Meta-governance participation is voluntary but incentivized. Domain-specific frameworks benefit from:
- Access to shared data, insights, and forecasting tools
- Conflict resolution support across domains
- Enhanced legitimacy through alignment with universal ethics
- Resource pooling (e.g., shared AI-assisted feedback mechanisms)
- Invitations to influence cross-cutting standards and protocols
- Increased visibility via legitimacy metrics and soft recognition frameworks
