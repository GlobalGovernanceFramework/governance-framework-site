# Reparations Protocol

**In this section:**
- [For Environmental and Tech Harms](#environmental-and-tech-harms)
- [Tools](#tools)

**Estimated Reading Time**: 8 minutes

The Reparations Protocol establishes principles, processes, and practices for addressing historical and ongoing environmental and technological harms. By integrating restorative justice, truth-telling, and material redress, the protocol creates pathways toward healing relationships between human communities, technological systems, and ecosystems that have been damaged through extractive practices, cultural erasure, or technological exploitation.

## <a id="environmental-and-tech-harms"></a>For Environmental and Tech Harms

The protocol addresses harms in both environmental and technological domains, recognizing their interconnected nature and cumulative impacts on communities and ecosystems.

### Identification

The first step in the reparations process is identifying affected communities, ecosystems, and the nature of harms experienced.

#### Ombudsman Role

A dedicated ombudsman office identifies and documents environmental and technological harms through:

- **Community-Initiated Processes**: Formal channels for communities to report historical and ongoing harms
- **Ecosystem Assessment**: Scientific and traditional knowledge evaluations of ecosystem damage
- **Technology Impact Review**: Assessment of harms from technological systems and extraction
- **Historical Documentation**: Research into documented environmental injustices
- **Cultural Impact Evaluation**: Analysis of impacts on cultural practices and knowledge systems

#### Assessment Methodologies

Identification employs multiple methodologies to ensure comprehensive understanding:

- TGIF's Stakeholder Ethics Assessment for human community impacts
- *Ecological function assessments* for ecosystem harms
- Historical research into documented environmental injustices
- Community testimony and oral history documentation
- Technological harm tracking using AI ethics violation databases
- Indigenous knowledge integration through authorized knowledge holders

#### Prioritization Framework

Given limited resources, the protocol includes a prioritization framework considering:

- Severity and scope of harm
- Vulnerability of affected communities and ecosystems
- Risk of irreversible damage or cultural loss
- Feasibility of meaningful redress
- Community-identified priorities
- Interconnected harms affecting multiple systems

### Assessment

Once harms are identified, a thorough assessment process determines appropriate reparative measures.

#### Types of Harm Recognized

The protocol recognizes diverse forms of harm including:

- **Ecological Degradation**: Damage to ecosystems and biodiversity
- **Cultural Harm**: Loss of traditional practices tied to ecosystem relationships
- **Health Impacts**: Community health effects from environmental contamination
- **Economic Losses**: Livelihoods disrupted by environmental damage
- **Knowledge Exploitation**: Appropriation of traditional knowledge without consent or benefit
- **Data Extraction**: Technological exploitation of community data
- **Technological Displacement**: Communities harmed by technological change
- **Self-Determination Loss**: Removal of governance authority over traditional territories

#### Valuation Approaches

Assessment employs multiple valuation approaches to understand harm dimensions:

- **Ecosystem Services**: Economic valuation of lost ecosystem functions
- **Cultural Significance**: Community-defined cultural value assessment
- **Health Burden**: Quantification of health impacts and costs
- **Livelihood Analysis**: Assessment of economic impacts over time
- **Knowledge Value**: Valuation of traditional knowledge contributions
- **Governance Impacts**: Assessment of lost self-determination
- **Cumulative Effects**: Analysis of compounding impacts across generations

#### Community Leadership

Assessment processes center affected communities through:

- Leadership roles in assessment design
- Shared authority in methodology selection
- Integration of indigenous and traditional valuation frameworks
- Community verification of assessment findings
- Final determination authority on harm characterization
- Intergenerational consultation to capture cumulative impacts

### Allocation

Based on assessment findings, the protocol guides allocation of resources and actions for meaningful redress.

#### Reparations Fund

The framework allocates 20% of the $100B crisis fund specifically for reparations, distributed through:

- **Direct Payments**: Financial compensation to affected communities
- **Ecosystem Restoration**: Funded rehabilitation of damaged ecosystems
- **Cultural Revitalization**: Support for cultural practice restoration
- **Health Remediation**: Resources for addressing environmental health impacts
- **Governance Restoration**: Support for rebuilding traditional governance systems
- **Technology Access**: Equitable access to beneficial technologies
- **Knowledge Protection**: Systems for safeguarding traditional knowledge

#### Non-Financial Reparations

The protocol recognizes that monetary compensation alone is insufficient and includes:

- **Legal Recognition**: Formal acknowledgment of rights and harms
- **Policy Reform**: Changes to prevent similar future harms
- **Return of Lands**: Restoration of territory to traditional stewards
- **Knowledge Repatriation**: Return of cultural and ecological knowledge
- **Truth-Telling Processes**: Public acknowledgment of harms
- **Formal Apologies**: Official recognition of responsibility
- **Governance Reform**: Structural changes to decision-making systems

#### Implementation Timeline

Reparations implementation follows a phased approach:

1. **Immediate Relief**: Urgent measures addressing ongoing harm (1 year)
2. **Medium-Term Redress**: Structural and substantive changes (2-5 years)
3. **Long-Term Reconciliation**: Sustained measures for healing (5-20 years)
4. **Intergenerational Healing**: Ongoing processes for future generations

### Documentation

Thorough documentation of the reparations process ensures accountability, learning, and prevents historical erasure.

#### Documentation Standards

All reparations processes adhere to rigorous documentation standards:

- Comprehensive records of identification, assessment, and allocation
- Multiple formats including written, oral, visual, and digital
- Community ownership of documentation with appropriate data sovereignty
- Accessible archives for public education and accountability
- Protocols for culturally sensitive information protection
- Integration into training via TGIF's Ethics Transparency Report Template

#### Knowledge Integration

Documentation is designed for integration into broader knowledge systems:

- Connection to *framework learning system* for continuous improvement
- Case study development for implementation learning
- Academic partnerships for research while maintaining community control
- Policy brief creation for broader system change
- Educational material development for public understanding

#### Public Accessibility

Documentation is made publicly accessible through:

- Digital archives with appropriate cultural safeguards
- Community-based physical archives
- Educational curriculum development
- Public exhibitions and communications
- Annual public reporting on reparations implementation
- Accessible formats following the *Accessibility Implementation Matrix*

The Reparations Protocol represents a crucial element of the Environmental Stewardship Framework, acknowledging that transformative governance requires addressing historical and ongoing harms. By establishing clear processes for identification, assessment, allocation, and documentation of reparative measures, the protocol creates pathways toward healing relationships between communities, ecosystems, and technological systems.

The protocol's emphasis on community leadership, multiple forms of valuation, and integration of diverse knowledge systems ensures that reparations processes themselves do not reproduce harmful patterns. Through this approach, reparations become not merely compensation for past wrongs but transformative processes that restore relationships, rebuild governance systems, and create foundations for more just environmental stewardship.
