## <a id="essential-terminology"></a>Essential Terminology

> *"Our words are sacred. They create the world we live in. We must speak with care, with truth, with respect for all our relations."*  
> — Lakota teaching

### Core Framework Concepts

**Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)**
*Pronunciation: [BAH-zez]*
Self-governing territories organized around watersheds, ecosystems, and traditional Indigenous territories rather than colonial nation-state boundaries. BAZs operate under Indigenous governance systems with authority over traditional territories, natural resource management, and cultural practices. They represent fundamental reorganization of political authority from imposed colonial structures to organic governance systems emerging from ecological and cultural relationships.

*Traditional Concept Connection*: Based on Indigenous understanding that governance should follow the patterns the Earth teaches—watersheds, seasonal cycles, and species relationships—rather than arbitrary lines drawn on colonial maps.

**Ceremonial Governance**
Decision-making processes that integrate traditional spiritual practices, ritual, and ceremony with community governance and political authority. Ceremonial governance represents the evolution of formal political structures toward organic stewardship systems where governance becomes inseparable from spiritual practice and ecological relationship.

*Traditional Foundation*: Aboriginal Australian songlines demonstrate how ceremonial practice, ecological knowledge, and political authority integrate into unified systems maintaining stability across tens of thousands of years.

**Earth Council (Kawsay Pacha / Terra Sapiens)**
*Pronunciation: [KOW-sigh PAH-cha / TERRA SAH-pee-ens]*
Global Indigenous-led governance body providing moral and spiritual authority for planetary decisions while respecting cultural autonomy and community sovereignty. The Earth Council operates through earned respect, traditional protocols, and consensus-based decision-making rather than imposed authority.

*Etymology*: "Kawsay Pacha" from Quechua meaning "living Earth" or "world where we live." "Terra Sapiens" combining Latin for "Earth" with "wise" to indicate Earth-centered wisdom.

**Free, Prior, and Informed Consent 2.0 (FPIC 2.0)**
Enhanced consent protocols that give Indigenous communities actual veto power over decisions affecting traditional territories, rather than mere consultation rights. FPIC 2.0 includes ongoing consent requirements, cultural protocol compliance, and community authority to withdraw consent when circumstances change.

*Enhancement from Original FPIC*: Moves beyond consultation to genuine Indigenous authority, with enforcement mechanisms and legal protection for Indigenous decision-making sovereignty.

**Future Generations Tribunal**
International court system representing interests of future generations in current decision-making, with youth advocates, elder wisdom guidance, and AI predictive modeling evaluating all major decisions for seven-generation impact.

*Traditional Foundation*: Haudenosaunee Great Law requirement that "in every deliberation, we must consider the impact on the seventh generation to come."

**Global Indigenous Creative Commons (GICC)**
Community-controlled framework providing automatic protection for Traditional Knowledge while enabling ethical sharing through Indigenous-governed protocols. The GICC prevents appropriation while supporting collaborative planetary healing under Indigenous authority.

*Technical Implementation*: Blockchain-based system with Indigenous-controlled access keys, ensuring communities maintain sovereignty over their knowledge while participating in ethical global collaboration.

**Gross Planetary Health (GPH) Index**
Economic measurement system that replaces Gross Domestic Product (GDP) with indicators prioritizing ecological restoration, cultural vitality, and intergenerational wellbeing over extraction and accumulation.

*Measurement Components*: Ecological Health (40% weight), Cultural Resilience (30% weight), Community Wellbeing (30% weight), with specific indicators adapted to bioregional and cultural contexts.

**Indigenous AI Oracles**
Artificial intelligence systems trained on Traditional Ecological Knowledge and operating under Indigenous governance, designed to support rather than replace Indigenous decision-making and cultural practices. These systems operate under strict Indigenous oversight with community authority to modify or shut down systems that threaten cultural protocols.

*Ethical Framework*: AI serves Traditional Knowledge rather than replacing it, with Indigenous communities maintaining ultimate authority over technological applications affecting their territories and cultures.

**Red Lines Clause**
Protective mechanism allowing Indigenous communities to exit, modify, or redirect any governance framework that becomes co-opted by colonial or extractive interests. The Red Lines Clause ensures Indigenous sovereignty over participation terms and prevents appropriation of Indigenous governance models.

*Purpose*: Maintains Indigenous authority over framework implementation and prevents colonial co-optation or corporate greenwashing of Indigenous governance innovations.

**Rights of Nature**
Legal recognition that ecosystems, waterways, mountains, forests, and other natural beings possess inherent rights independent of human utility, with Indigenous peoples serving as their advocates and legal representatives.

*Legal Implementation*: Constitutional amendments, ecosystem personhood legislation, and Indigenous court systems with jurisdiction over Rights of Nature violations and enforcement.

**Seven-Generation Accountability**
Decision-making principle requiring evaluation of all policies, technologies, and governance decisions for their impact on seven generations (approximately 200 years) into the future, with long-term consequences taking priority over short-term benefits.

*Traditional Foundation*: Haudenosaunee governance system inherently considering long-term impact through seven-generation thinking, ensuring decisions serve children not yet born rather than immediate interests.

**Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)**
*Also: Indigenous Knowledge Systems, Traditional Knowledge*
Community-held knowledge, practices, and beliefs about the relationships between living beings and their environment, transmitted through generations via cultural transmission and direct experience with the natural world.

*Characteristics*: Cumulative, adaptive, dynamic, holistic, and embedded in broader cultural and spiritual systems. TEK represents sophisticated scientific understanding developed through millennia of observation and relationship with specific ecosystems.
