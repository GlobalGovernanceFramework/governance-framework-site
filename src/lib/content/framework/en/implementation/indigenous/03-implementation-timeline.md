# Implementation Timeline: Planting Seeds for Seven Generations

> *"Plant the seeds today for the forest of tomorrow. The ancestors dreamed this moment; the children depend on our courage."*  
> — Haida proverb

**In this section:**
- [Pre-Phase 0: Building the Foundation (2025)](#pre-phase-foundation)
- [Phase 0: First Seeds (2025-2026)](#phase-0-first-seeds)
- [Foundation Phase: Growing Roots (2025-2030)](#foundation-phase)
- [Expansion Phase: Branching Out (2030-2040)](#expansion-phase)
- [Transformation Phase: Full Flowering (2040-2050+)](#transformation-phase)

**Estimated Reading Time**: 20 minutes

This implementation timeline honors Indigenous understanding that transformation happens in generations, not election cycles. Like the traditional practice of planting seeds that will provide food for children not yet born, this framework builds infrastructure for Indigenous sovereignty and planetary healing across multiple decades while creating immediate benefits for communities ready to begin.

Each phase builds on previous foundations while respecting the organic pace of cultural and ecological regeneration. Implementation follows Indigenous principles of relationship-building, consensus development, and seven-generation thinking rather than imposed timelines or external pressure. Communities can enter at any phase based on their readiness and cultural protocols, with earlier adopters providing mentorship and support for emerging initiatives.
