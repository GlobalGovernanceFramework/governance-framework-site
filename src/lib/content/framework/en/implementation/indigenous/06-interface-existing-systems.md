# Interface with Existing Systems: Transforming the Colonial Matrix

The interface between Indigenous governance and existing colonial systems represents neither accommodation nor assimilation, but strategic transformation—using the contradictions within colonial institutions to advance Indigenous sovereignty while building alternative systems that eventually replace rather than reform colonial structures. This approach recognizes that colonial systems contain legal and political mechanisms that can be leveraged for Indigenous liberation while never accepting colonial authority as legitimate.

Each interface strategy operates on multiple levels simultaneously: using existing legal frameworks to protect Indigenous rights while building Traditional Knowledge-based alternatives; engaging international institutions to gain recognition while developing Indigenous-led global coordination; and working within colonial governments while asserting Indigenous sovereignty and territorial authority.

**Navigation Note**: This interface strategy demonstrates how Indigenous communities can leverage contradictions within colonial systems while building alternatives that eventually replace rather than reform colonial structures. Continue to [Pathways for Broader Engagement](/framework/docs/implementation/indigenous#07-pathways-broader-engagement) to explore how non-Indigenous allies can support Indigenous-led transformation, or access [Implementation Tools](/framework/tools/indigenous) for practical resources supporting legal advocacy, political organizing, and corporate accountability campaigns.

**Strategic Guidance**: These interface strategies operate simultaneously across multiple levels—legal, political, economic, and cultural—using colonial institutions' own contradictions to advance Indigenous sovereignty while never accepting colonial authority as legitimate. The goal is transformation, not accommodation.
