**Estimated Reading Time**: 22 minutes

The structural components of Indigenous governance emerge from the understanding that governance is not administration but relationship—relationship with place, with each other, with non-human beings, and with future generations. These structures honor the sacred architecture of Traditional Ecological Knowledge while providing the scale and coordination necessary for planetary transformation.

Each component operates as a living system, adapting to local cultural protocols while maintaining connection to broader Indigenous solidarity networks. They are designed to strengthen rather than replace traditional governance systems, providing infrastructure for Indigenous communities to coordinate across bioregions while maintaining sovereignty over their own territories and cultural practices.

## <a id="earth-council"></a>Earth Council (Kawsay Pacha / Terra Sapiens)

> *"In the council of all beings, every voice must be heard—the voice of the mountain, the voice of the river, the voice of the children not yet born."*  
> — Andean teaching

### Purpose and Authority

The Earth Council serves as the moral and spiritual authority for planetary governance, providing guidance and coordination for bioregional transformation while respecting Indigenous sovereignty and cultural autonomy. Unlike colonial governance structures that impose authority from above, the Earth Council operates through earned respect, traditional protocols, and consensus-based decision-making.

**Core Functions**:
- **Planetary guidance** on interconnected challenges affecting multiple bioregions
- **Inter-bioregional mediation** when conflicts arise between Indigenous communities or ecosystems
- **Protocol development** for ethical engagement with Traditional Knowledge and Indigenous territories
- **Emergency coordination** for climate disasters, extractive industry threats, and cultural emergencies

### Composition and Selection

- **Indigenous Elders** (40%): Traditional knowledge keepers and hereditary chiefs from each bioregional confederation
- **Indigenous Youth** (20%): Next-generation leaders and climate activists under 30
- **Ecological Scientists** (15%): Researchers working under Indigenous research protocols and community partnership
- **Cultural Practitioners** (10%): Artists, storytellers, and ceremony leaders maintaining traditional practices
- **Land Defenders** (10%): Frontline activists protecting territories from extractive industries
- **AI Observers** (5%): Indigenous-controlled artificial intelligence systems providing ecological data and pattern recognition

**Selection Process**:
- **Bioregional nomination** by Indigenous councils within each major ecosystem area
- **Cultural protocol consultation** ensuring representation respects traditional governance systems
- **Consensus confirmation** requiring 70% agreement from existing Earth Council members
- **Elder council oversight** with veto power to ensure cultural appropriateness

### Operational Framework

**Bi-Annual Wisdom Summits**: Physical gatherings that rotate between bioregions, following seasonal cycles and cultural calendars. These summits integrate:
- **Ceremonial opening and closing** according to local Indigenous protocols
- **Consensus-based decision-making** using modified Iroquois Confederacy procedures
- **Multi-species consultation** including non-human representative voices
