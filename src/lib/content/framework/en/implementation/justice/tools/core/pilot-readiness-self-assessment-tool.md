# Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool

## Overview
The **Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool** enables jurisdictions to evaluate their preparedness for launching pilot projects under the Justice Systems Implementation Framework. It assesses governance, legal compatibility, resource availability, stakeholder engagement, and technological capacity, as referenced in the [Implementation Mechanisms](/framework/docs/implementation/justice-systems#04-implementation-mechanisms) section. Enhanced with weighted scoring, pre-assessment preparation, action planning, peer learning, and visual tracking, the tool helps jurisdictions identify strengths, address gaps, and develop actionable plans for successful pilot implementation. It is adaptable to diverse legal systems and resource levels, ensuring inclusivity and practicality.

**Purpose**: To ensure jurisdictions are equipped to operationalize pilot projects, contributing to the framework’s goals of 25% increased public trust, 80% fair access, and 70% case resolution by 2035.

**Target Users**: National Implementation Units, Regional Justice Hubs, policymakers, and community stakeholders.

**Format**: Checklist with weighted scoring rubric, qualitative reflections, action planning template, peer learning guidance, and visual progress tracking.

**Access**: Available at [Tools Library](/framework/tools/justice-systems/pilot-readiness-self-assessment-tool-en.pdf) in PDF, markdown, and offline formats. Multilingual versions planned by Year 2 (2027).

## Pre-Assessment Preparation
To ensure accurate and comprehensive responses, jurisdictions should gather the following information before starting the assessment:

- **Governance Data**: Documentation on National Implementation Unit structure, decision-making protocols, and representation metrics (e.g., percentage of marginalized group involvement).
- **Legal Framework Insights**: Results of any jurisdictional compatibility assessments, details on restorative/indigenous justice integration, and legal aid coverage statistics.
- **Resource Inventory**: Budget allocations, staffing levels, training records, and infrastructure availability (e.g., internet coverage, office space).
- **Stakeholder Engagement Plans**: Existing engagement strategies, participation metrics for marginalized groups, and mediator training records.
- **Technological Capacity**: Internet penetration rates, personnel trained in digital tools, availability of low-tech alternatives, and AI bias audit reports.
- **Stakeholder Input**: Consult local communities, indigenous leaders, and youth groups to validate data and identify qualitative challenges.
- **Timeframe**: Allocate 1–2 weeks for data collection, involving cross-sector teams (e.g., legal, administrative, community representatives).

**Tip**: Use the [Stakeholder Engagement Charter Template](/framework/tools/justice-systems/stakeholder-engagement-charter-en.pdf) to structure consultations and ensure diverse input.

- **1 point**: Initial steps taken (major gaps, planning underway).
- **0 points**: Not started (significant gaps, no plans).

**Weighted Maximum Scores**:
- Governance: 30% × 12 points = 3.6 points per question (14.4 total)
- Legal Framework: 25% × 12 points = 3 points per question (12 total)
- Resources: 20% × 12 points = 2.4 points per question (9.6 total)
- Stakeholder Engagement: 15% × 12 points = 1.8 points per question (7.2 total)
- Technology: 10% × 12 points = 1.2 points per question (4.8 total)
- **Total Maximum**: 47.6 points (rounded to 48 for simplicity)

**Scoring Calculation**:
- Multiply raw scores (0–3) by the question’s weight (e.g., Governance: 3 × 1.2 = 3.6).
- Sum weighted scores for each area and total.

**Scoring Interpretation**:
- **38–48 (High Readiness)**: Ready to launch pilot with minimal support. Focus on sustaining momentum.
- **28–37 (Medium Readiness)**: Prepared but requires targeted support. Develop action plan with Regional Justice Hub.
- **19–27 (Low Readiness)**: Significant gaps requiring substantial capacity building. Prioritize foundational steps.
- **0–18 (Not Ready)**: Critical gaps across multiple areas. Engage Regional Justice Hub for comprehensive support.

## Visual Progress Tracking
Use the radar chart template below to visualize scores across the five areas, highlighting strengths and gaps.

![Radar Chart](/images/framework/justice/pilot-readiness-radar-chart.svg)

**Instructions**:
1. Plot weighted scores for each area on the radar chart (e.g., Governance score of 10 out of 14.4).
2. Connect points to form a pentagon, visually identifying high and low areas.
3. Save or print the chart for stakeholder discussions and submit with assessment results.
4. Access a digital radar chart tool at [Tools Library](/framework/tools/justice-systems/visual-aids) or use manual graphing for offline settings.

**Example**:
- Governance: 10/14.4
- Legal: 8/12
- Resources: 6/9.6
- Stakeholder: 5/7.2
- Technology: 3/4.8
- Plotting shows strong governance but weaker technology, guiding prioritization.

## Post-Assessment Action Planning Template

| Area | Score/Max | Priority (High/Medium/Low) | Action Steps | Responsible Party | Timeline | Resources Needed |
|------|-----------|----------------------------|--------------|------------------|----------|------------------|
| Governance | /14.4 | | e.g., Establish National Implementation Unit | e.g., Ministry of Justice | e.g., Q1 2026 | e.g., $100,000, 5 staff |
| Legal Framework | /12 | | | | | |
| Resources | /9.6 | | | | | |
| Stakeholder Engagement | /7.2 | | | | | |
| Technology | /4.8 | | | | | |

**Instructions**:
1. **Score/Max**: Enter weighted score for each area.
2. **Priority**: Assign High (score `<`50% of max), Medium (50–75%), or Low (`>`75%) based on score.
3. **Action Steps**: List specific actions to address gaps (e.g., train mediators, secure funding).
4. **Responsible Party**: Identify lead entity or individual.
5. **Timeline**: Set realistic deadlines (e.g., 3–12 months).
6. **Resources Needed**: Specify budget, personnel, or support (e.g., global justice fund).
7. Review quarterly with Regional Justice Hub to track progress.

**Example**:
| Area | Score/Max | Priority | Action Steps | Responsible Party | Timeline | Resources Needed |
|------|-----------|----------|--------------|------------------|----------|------------------|
| Technology | 3/4.8 | High | Train 20 staff in AI tools | Tech Coordinator | Q2 2026 | $50,000, trainer |

## Peer Learning Component
Connect with jurisdictions facing similar challenges or readiness levels to share strategies and resources.

- **Peer Matching**: Regional Justice Hubs facilitate connections based on assessment scores, legal systems, or challenges (e.g., low technological capacity). Contact [globalgovernanceframework@gmail.com] to request a match.
- **Collaboration Platforms**: Join the Implementation Community Platform ([Tools Library](/framework/tools/justice-systems)) by Year 2 (2027) for virtual forums, targeting 1,000 active users by Year 3.
- **Activities**:
  - **Virtual Exchanges**: Quarterly video calls to discuss action plans and best practices (e.g., governance setup).
  - **Case Study Sharing**: Submit and review peer case studies via the knowledge management system ([Implementation Mechanisms](/framework/docs/implementation/justice-systems#04-implementation-mechanisms)).
  - **Joint Training**: Co-host workshops with peers to pool resources, targeting 50 joint events by Year 3.
- **Benefits**: Learn from peers’ successes (e.g., stakeholder engagement models), access shared resources, and build regional networks.
- **Example**: A low-readiness jurisdiction with weak technology capacity connects with a medium-readiness peer to adopt low-tech court templates, reducing implementation costs.
