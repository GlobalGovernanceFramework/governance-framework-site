**Planned Visual Risk Matrix**: A risk prioritization matrix illustrating likelihood and impact of key challenges is under development and will be included in the [Appendices](/framework/docs/implementation/justice#11-appendices).

The Challenges and Mitigation Strategies section identifies key risks to the framework’s implementation and provides proactive measures to address them, ensuring resilience and adaptability. Building on the inclusive participation strategies of the [Stakeholder Engagement](/framework/docs/implementation/justice#07-stakeholder-engagement) section, it tackles priority obstacles such as political resistance, resource disparities, and technological challenges, with clear accountability and regional flexibility. Rooted in the framework’s principles of universal access, rule of law, cultural sensitivity, and transparency, it supports the goals of 25% increased public trust, 80% fair access, and 70% case resolution by 2035.

### <a id="overview"></a>Overview
Implementing a global justice system faces complex challenges, from geopolitical tensions to technological disparities. This section outlines five critical challenges and corresponding mitigation strategies, leveraging governance, legal, and digital mechanisms established in prior sections. By anticipating risks, fostering stakeholder collaboration, and establishing clear accountability for risk management, the framework ensures sustainable progress toward a unified and equitable justice ecosystem. These challenges are not exhaustive but represent priority areas requiring strategic attention during implementation. A risk prioritization framework and continuous assessment process address systemic interactions and emerging risks, with transparent communication to stakeholders.
