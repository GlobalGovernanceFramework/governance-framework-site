The Global Governance Biodiversity Implementation Framework recognizes that transformative biodiversity protection requires genuine partnership with all stakeholders, centering indigenous sovereignty while creating meaningful roles for youth, transformed private sector, civil society, and public participation. This comprehensive engagement strategy moves beyond consultation to shared power, co-governance, and community control over biodiversity initiatives. All engagement mechanisms prioritize cultural competency, traditional knowledge sovereignty, and the understanding that lasting biodiversity protection emerges from justice, equity, and democratic participation rather than top-down conservation approaches.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Maori Co-Management of New Zealand Conservation** demonstrates successful indigenous-led stakeholder engagement. The Tuhoe people's 2014 settlement with New Zealand government established shared governance of Te Urewera, combining traditional Maori governance with contemporary conservation management. The model integrates traditional knowledge with modern science, provides economic opportunities for Maori communities, and has improved both cultural preservation and ecosystem health, serving as inspiration for indigenous co-management globally.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Amazon Youth-Elder Alliance** (2027-2030) successfully demonstrated intergenerational stakeholder engagement when 50 indigenous communities coordinated traditional knowledge preservation with youth digital activism. Elders shared traditional ecological knowledge through digital platforms controlled by youth technical coordinators, creating viral content that protected 2 million hectares of rainforest while strengthening cultural identity and providing economic alternatives through UBES systems and Bio-Arts Residencies.
