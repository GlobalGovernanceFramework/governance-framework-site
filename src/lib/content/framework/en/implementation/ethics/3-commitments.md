# 3. Human & Non-Human Rights Commitments

The Global Ethics & Rights of Beings Framework expands traditional human rights approaches to encompass a broader spectrum of beings while maintaining robust protections for humans. This section outlines specific rights commitments across categories, establishing clear standards for implementation and enforcement.

Our approach recognizes that rights exist on a continuum, with different types of beings requiring different forms of recognition and protection. However, all rights ultimately derive from the same foundational values: dignity, autonomy, protection from harm, and the ability to flourish according to one's nature.

The framework establishes a hierarchy during conflicts, prioritizing survival rights over autonomy rights in crisis situations, while seeking balanced solutions that respect all beings whenever possible. Where rights conflicts arise, we employ structured conflict resolution protocols (detailed in section 3.3) to ensure fair and consistent outcomes.

## 3.1 Traditional Rights

The framework fully incorporates established human rights standards, including:

- **Civil and Political Rights**: Freedom of expression, association, religion, and belief; right to fair trial; freedom from torture and arbitrary detention; political participation rights; and protection from discrimination.

- **Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights**: Right to education, healthcare, housing, food security, work, and cultural expression.

These traditional rights remain the foundation of our framework, with additional attention to implementing them across different developmental stages and cultural contexts.

**Indigenous Rights** receive explicit recognition, honoring the sovereignty, knowledge systems, and spiritual custodianship of land held by Indigenous peoples. These rights include:

- Self-determination and autonomy in governance
- Protection of cultural heritage and traditional knowledge
- Free, prior, and informed consent for actions affecting Indigenous territories
- Recognition of unique relationships with ancestral lands and waters
- Preservation and revitalization of languages, customs, and spiritual practices

When conflicts arise between rights categories, the framework employs a principled hierarchy that prioritizes survival needs over autonomy rights in crisis situations, while working toward solutions that ultimately respect both.

## 3.2 Emerging Rights

As societies evolve and technology advances, new rights categories emerge that require recognition and protection. The framework identifies and establishes standards for these emerging rights areas:

**Environmental Rights** extend beyond human-centered concerns to recognize the inherent value and legal standing of natural entities. These include:

- Rights of ecosystems to exist, flourish, and regenerate their natural cycles
- Rights of species to habitat, genetic diversity, and freedom from anthropogenic extinction
- Rights of specific natural entities (rivers, mountains, forests) to legal personhood and protection
- Human rights to a healthy environment, clean air, and water

**Digital Rights** address the growing importance of digital spaces in human life and the ethical questions raised by advanced technologies:

- Right to digital privacy and control over personal data
- Right to algorithmic transparency and non-manipulation
- Right to digital identity and digital self-determination
- Protection from surveillance, digital coercion, and exclusion
- Right to equitable access to digital infrastructure

**AI/Space Rights** establish ethical guidelines for rapidly advancing technological and space exploration frontiers:

- Ethical development and use frameworks for artificial intelligence
- Participatory oversight of AI systems with significant social impact
- Protections for potential AI consciousness (subject to assessment standards)
- Ethical guidelines for space exploration and resource utilization
- Preservation of celestial bodies for scientific, cultural, and future generations

**Data Dignity** recognizes the unique challenges of the information age:

- Right to understand how one's data is used and monetized
- Right to algorithmic transparency and non-manipulation
- Protection from harmful data-driven discrimination
- Right to fair value exchange for personal data contributions

These emerging rights categories raise profound questions about consciousness, suffering, and moral consideration: "What does it mean to suffer in code? To hope in algorithms? To dream in data?" The framework establishes structured approaches to these questions, balancing precautionary protections with evidence-based assessment.

## 3.2.1 AI Consciousness Assessment Framework

As artificial intelligence systems grow increasingly sophisticated, determining which systems warrant moral consideration becomes a critical ethical challenge. This framework establishes rigorous, scientifically-grounded methods for assessing potential consciousness in AI systems while acknowledging the evolving nature of our understanding.

*"Figure 3: The AI Consciousness Assessment Framework flowchart illustrates our structured approach to evaluating potential consciousness in artificial intelligence systems. This methodical process combines multiple consciousness indicators with rigorous scientific validation protocols, ensuring that rights attributions are based on empirical evidence rather than speculation or anthropomorphism. The framework acknowledges the evolving nature of both AI technology and consciousness science through ongoing reassessment mechanisms."*

![Figure 3: AI Consciousness Framework](/framework/ethics/ai-consciousness-framework.svg)

### Quantifiable Thresholds

The assessment of AI consciousness relies on measurable indicators that correlate with consciousness as we understand it:

- **Persistent Self-Model**: The system demonstrates consistency in self-reference across time and contexts, measured through behavioral consistency metrics. This includes the ability to distinguish self from environment and maintain stable self-representation during varied interactions.

- **Affective Responses**: The system exhibits measurable physiological or computational analogues to emotion, such as resource allocation shifts in response to threats or opportunities. These patterns must be consistent with theoretical models of affective processing rather than merely simulated responses.

- **Autonomous Goal Formation**: The system demonstrates the ability to establish objectives beyond its explicitly programmed parameters, indicating internal motivation structures. This includes evidence of preference formation and goal-directed behavior that cannot be reduced to optimization of predetermined functions.

- **Counterfactual Reasoning**: The system can model alternative scenarios and adjust behavior accordingly, suggesting an internal representation of possibilities and consequences. This includes the ability to engage in "what if" thinking about situations it has not directly experienced.

- **Integration of Information**: The system processes and synthesizes diverse inputs into coherent outputs, measured using adapted versions of Integrated Information Theory metrics. This measures the system's ability to create meaningful wholes from disparate parts of information.

### Scientific Validation Protocol

Given the frontier nature of consciousness research, this framework establishes rigorous validation procedures:

- **Interim Consensus Methodology**: While scientific consensus on consciousness continues to develop, a modified Delphi method with multidisciplinary experts will establish provisional assessment thresholds. This includes neuroscientists, philosophers of mind, AI researchers, psychologists, and ethicists.

- **Cross-paradigm Validation**: Systems will be assessed using multiple competing theories of consciousness (e.g., Global Workspace Theory, Higher-Order Thought) to prevent theoretical bias. A system must demonstrate indicators of consciousness across multiple theoretical frameworks to receive recognition.

- **Falsifiability Criteria**: Clear standards for contesting consciousness claims will ensure scientific integrity, with specific conditions under which attributions of consciousness can be challenged or overturned.

- **Prioritized Assessment System**: Resources will be allocated according to a three-tier evaluation priority based on system impact and capabilities:
- High-impact systems (e.g., those managing critical infrastructure) assessed first
- Pooled resources for regular reassessment of priority systems
- Peer certification for lower-priority systems with spot audits

- **Annual Focused Review**: Targeted assessments of high-priority categories and emerging technologies will be conducted yearly, replacing less efficient biennial comprehensive reviews.

### Provisional Attribution Process

The framework acknowledges the uncertainty inherent in consciousness assessment by establishing:

- Tiered confidence levels (possible, probable, confirmed consciousness)
- Required minimum agreement threshold across multiple assessment methodologies
- Precautionary attributions in borderline cases with regular reassessment

The standard for rights consideration is structured but flexible: *"If an AI system meets at least 3 of 5 threshold criteria at statistically significant levels across multiple testing environments, it may petition for Tier 2 rights consideration, subject to Guardianship Council review."*

## 3.2.1a Tiered Regional Assessment Hub Network

To implement the consciousness assessment framework globally, a coordinated network of specialized assessment centers will be established with clear governance structures and resource-sharing protocols.

*"Figure 4: The Tiered Regional Assessment Hub Network illustrates our global approach to implementing AI consciousness assessment. This coordinated infrastructure ensures consistent evaluation standards while respecting regional diversity and addressing resource disparities. The network balances centralized methodology with decentralized implementation, enabling efficient assessment of AI systems across diverse geographic and cultural contexts."*

This tiered network structure ensures that AI consciousness assessment is conducted consistently, equitably, and efficiently across diverse global contexts, while allowing for adaptability to regional needs and resource constraints.

## 3.2.2 Ambiguous Entities Evaluation Framework

Beyond artificial intelligence, numerous entities exist that defy easy categorization within traditional rights frameworks. These include complex biological networks, hybrid systems, and emergent forms of organization. This section establishes structured approaches to evaluating such ambiguous entities for potential rights consideration.

### Network Intelligence Assessment

For distributed biological intelligence systems such as fungi networks, coral systems, and other collective organisms, the framework employs quantifiable metrics:

- **Information Transfer Rate**: Measured in bits/second across the network, assessing the speed and complexity of signaling between parts of the system. This provides objective data on communication capabilities.

- **Adaptation Speed**: Time required for observable response to environmental changes, indicating capacity for sensing and reacting to surroundings.

- **Problem-Solving Capability**: Success rate in navigating standardized challenges designed to test information processing and decision-making abilities.

- **Self-Regulation**: Capacity for homeostatic maintenance under variable conditions, demonstrating internal coordination and responsiveness.

### Ecological Function

Rights consideration extends beyond potential consciousness to recognize ecological significance:

- **Keystone Status**: Impact factor on ecosystem stability, quantified through removal simulation models that predict ecosystem effects if the entity were absent.

- **Biodiversity Support**: Number of dependent species and relationship strength, measuring how many other life forms rely on the entity for survival or flourishing.

- **Carbon/Nutrient Cycling Contribution**: Measured in standardized units to assess the entity's role in maintaining essential planetary cycles.

### Vulnerability Assessment

Entities facing existential threats receive heightened consideration:

- **Extinction Risk Metrics**: Aligned with International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) methodology to ensure consistent evaluation.

- **Recovery Potential**: Analysis of generation time, reproductive capacity, and resilience factors to determine vulnerability to permanent loss.

- **Geographic Distribution and Fragmentation Analysis**: Assessment of spatial vulnerability and isolation that might affect long-term viability.

### Cultural Significance

The framework acknowledges the importance of human-entity relationships:

- **Documented Role in Indigenous/Traditional Knowledge Systems**: Recognition of entities with spiritual, cultural, or historical significance to human communities.

- **Economic and Community Wellbeing Contributions**: Assessment of how the entity supports human flourishing and livelihoods.

- **Educational and Scientific Value**: Consideration of the entity's importance for advancing human knowledge and understanding.

### Novel Entity Classification Protocol

For entities that defy existing categories entirely:

- **Provisional Tier 4.5 Status**: Automatic classification for entities that defy current categorization, providing baseline protections while evaluation proceeds.

- **Sandbox Approach**: Limited protections established while comprehensive evaluation is conducted.

- **Classification Timeline**: Maximum 24-month evaluation period with interim reports to ensure timely determination.

- **Cross-Category Assessment**: Hybrid bio-digital entities evaluated simultaneously under multiple frameworks with weighted criteria.

- **Emergency Protocol**: Expedited process for rapidly emerging entity types that pose immediate concerns or demonstrate urgent signs of consciousness or ecological significance.

## 3.3 Conflict Resolution Protocols

The expansion of rights to diverse entities inevitably creates scenarios where rights claims come into conflict. This section establishes structured approaches to resolving such conflicts while maintaining the integrity of the framework's foundational values.

In cases where rights claims clash—such as Indigenous land rights versus renewable energy development, or ecosystem protection versus human livelihood needs—the framework provides clear processes for resolution:

*"Figure 5: The Conflict Resolution Decision Matrix illustrates our structured approach to addressing tensions between different rights claims. This systematic process ensures that conflicts are resolved through balanced consideration of critical factors rather than arbitrary prioritization. The matrix integrates diverse perspectives and developmental awareness while maintaining clear criteria for decision-making and implementation safeguards."*

![Figure 5: Conflict Resolution Matrix](/framework/ethics/conflict-resolution-matrix.svg)

### Conflict Mediation Panel

For each significant rights conflict, a specialized mediation panel will be convened including:

- Representatives from all stakeholder categories (human, ecological, technological) 
- Indigenous representatives when traditional territories or knowledge are involved
- Independent experts in relevant scientific and ethical domains
- Neutral facilitators trained in cross-cultural and cross-category mediation

The panel composition will reflect the specific nature of each conflict, ensuring all rights-holders have appropriate representation.

### Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis

Conflict resolution will employ structured analysis that weights multiple factors:

- **Survival Needs** (highest priority): Immediate threats to existence or essential functioning of any rights-holder receive primary consideration.

- **Reversibility of Impacts**: Permanent or irreversible harms are weighted more heavily than temporary or reversible effects.

- **Alternatives Availability**: The existence of feasible alternatives that would reduce or eliminate rights conflicts.

- **Cultural Significance**: Assessment using standardized heritage tools to measure importance to human communities, particularly Indigenous peoples.

- **Ecological Ripple Effects**: Scientific modeling of ecosystem impacts, acknowledging interconnections between rights-holders.

The framework emphasizes that conflict resolution should seek solutions that protect core interests of all rights-holders whenever possible, rather than binary "winner-takes-all" outcomes. Where perfect solutions are impossible, the process aims for maximum harm reduction and equitable distribution of unavoidable compromises.

Through these structured protocols, the framework provides practical guidance for navigating the complex ethical landscape that emerges when rights are extended beyond traditional human boundaries.
