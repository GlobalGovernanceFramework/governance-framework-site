This interactive visualization will illustrate the graduated approach to rights across different entity categories, showing how rights recognition scales according to capacity, consciousness, and ecological importance.

## What to Expect

When completed, this tool will allow you to:
- Explore the different tiers of the Dynamic Rights Spectrum
- Understand the connections between entity types and rights categories
- See how rights protections scale based on specific characteristics
- Apply the spectrum to various case examples
