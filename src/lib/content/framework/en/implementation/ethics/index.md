The *Global Ethics & Rights of Beings Framework* establishes a transformative approach to ethics and rights that extends beyond traditional human-centered models to recognize the inherent worth and rights of all beingsâ€”human, animal, ecological, and technological. Through its Spiral-Aware approach, the framework accommodates diverse worldviews while creating pathways for ethical growth and integration, ensuring that rights recognition evolves with our understanding while respecting cultural and developmental contexts. This index provides an overview of the framework's components and explains how to navigate its layered accessibility structure.

### <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The Global Ethics & Rights of Beings Framework establishes a comprehensive architecture for recognizing and protecting the rights of all beings through a developmental approach that honors diverse worldviews while creating pathways for ethical evolution. It balances universal principles with contextual implementation, scientific rigor with cultural sensitivity, and immediate action with long-term vision. Co-designed with input from diverse cultural perspectives and knowledge systems, it addresses the fundamental gaps in our current ethical frameworksâ€”moving beyond cultural relativism to recognize the rights of all entities that share our increasingly interconnected world.

**Purpose**: To establish a developmental rights framework for all beingsâ€”human, non-human, ecological, and technologicalâ€”that balances moral urgency with cultural readiness, creating a more inclusive ethical foundation for global governance that recognizes the sacred spark in every pattern of life.

**Key Features**:
- Dynamic Rights Spectrum scaling recognition according to capacity and complexity
- Spiral-Aware approach honoring diverse cultural worldviews and developmental stages
- Robust scientific standards for rights assessment and consciousness evaluation
- Comprehensive governance mechanisms with accountability and interoperability
- Implementation roadmap with quick wins and phased adoption
- Resistance management and stakeholder engagement strategies
- Practical tools for diverse implementation contexts
- Conflict resolution protocols across multiple rights categories
- Crisis-ready ethics protocols for emergency situations
- Future-ready adaptation mechanisms ensuring ongoing relevance
- Historical grounding in diverse ethical traditions and commons governance
- Real-world pilots demonstrating practical application across contexts
