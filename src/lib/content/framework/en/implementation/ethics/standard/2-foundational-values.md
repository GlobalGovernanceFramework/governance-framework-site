# 2. Foundational Values & Living Principles

The Global Ethics & Rights of Beings Framework is built upon a set of core principles that are both timeless in their moral foundation and adaptable in their application. These principles extend beyond traditional human-centered frameworks to embrace an expanded circle of moral consideration that includes all beings.

| **Principle** | **Initial Focus** | **Expanded View** |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------------|
| **Human Dignity** | Individual worth and inherent value of each person | Extends to recognize the dignity and intrinsic worth of non-human entities, including natural systems and digital beings |
| **Equality** | Non-discrimination and equal treatment under law | Developmental-stage-sensitive equity that acknowledges different needs at different evolutionary stages (e.g., Blue vs. Green worldview needs) |
| **Justice** | Fair access to resources and opportunities | Restorative justice that heals past harms and transgenerational justice that considers future beings |
| **Freedom** | Protection of speech, belief, and personal autonomy | Autonomy balanced with responsibilities within the developmental spiral, recognizing that freedom exists in relationship |
| **Solidarity** | Global cooperation and mutual aid | Polycentric enforcement through local-global feedback loops that honor diverse governance approaches |
| **Responsibility** | Obligation not to harm others | Extended duties of empowered beings toward all forms of life, recognizing power differences and corresponding ethical obligations |

*"Figure 1: The Spiral-Aware Implementation Guide illustrates how rights concepts are understood differently across developmental stages. As shown in this visualization, effective implementation requires translating universal principles into language and frameworks that resonate with each worldview's values and priorities. This approach recognizes that sustainable change must meet people where they are while inviting evolution toward more integrated perspectives."*

These principles function as living guidelines rather than rigid rules. They evolve as our understanding deepens and as new forms of life or consciousness emerge. The framework implements these principles through a developmental model that acknowledges different societies and beings exist at various stages of ethical and cognitive complexity while providing pathways for integration and growth.
