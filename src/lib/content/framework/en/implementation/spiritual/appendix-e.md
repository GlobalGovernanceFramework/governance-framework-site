## Appendix E: Sunset Clause & Framework Evolution

The Religious & Spiritual Dialogue Framework embraces the principle that no governance structure should perpetuate itself when it no longer serves its purpose effectively. This appendix outlines the formal mechanisms for framework evolution, transformation, or dissolution when necessary.

### Sunset Clause Activation Criteria

The framework's sunset clause may be triggered under the following conditions:

**If the GCRSD fails biennial relevance reviews or systemic corruption is confirmed, the Advisory Board may trigger a 12-month transition to:**
1. **Reconstitute the framework with revised governance, or**
2. **Distribute assets to ethical interfaith initiatives (per hub dissolution protocols).**
**A 2/3 majority of Regional Hubs must approve this action.**

#### Biennial Relevance Review Failure
A relevance review is considered failed when:
- Participation rates fall below 60% for two consecutive years
- The framework demonstrates inability to adapt to changing contexts
- Alternative structures have emerged that better serve the framework's purpose
- The framework fails to demonstrate meaningful impact through established metrics
- The framework no longer represents the diversity of traditions it claims to serve

#### Systemic Corruption Confirmation
Systemic corruption is confirmed when:
- Independent audit reveals misuse of resources
- Documentation demonstrates persistent bias favoring certain traditions
- Investigation confirms undue influence by external actors or funding sources
- Patterns of exclusion or marginalization are verified
- Decision-making processes have been compromised by conflicts of interest

### Transition Process

Once the sunset clause is triggered, a structured 12-month transition process begins:

#### Month 1-3: Assessment & Determination
- Advisory Board conducts comprehensive evaluation of the framework's status
- Stakeholder consultations across all regions and tradition categories
- Financial and asset inventory completed
- Options analysis for reconstitution or dissolution
- Recommendation development with multiple scenarios

#### Month 4: Hub Decision Process
- Formal presentation of evaluation and recommendations to all Regional Hubs
- Regional deliberation period with structured feedback
- Formal vote requiring 2/3 majority to proceed with recommended action
- If approval is not achieved, Advisory Board must develop alternative recommendations

#### Month 5-10: Implementation Planning
**For Reconstitution Option:**
- Design team established with diverse representation
- New governance structure development
- Stakeholder consultation on revised framework
- Transition planning for leadership, activities, and resources
- Legacy documentation of lessons learned

**For Dissolution Option:**
- Asset distribution committee formed
- Identification of ethical recipient initiatives
- Due diligence on potential recipients
- Distribution plan development following hub dissolution protocols
- Legacy documentation preparation

#### Month 11-12: Execution
- Formal closure of existing governance structures
- Implementation of reconstitution or asset distribution
- Public communication of transition outcomes
- Documentation archive establishment
- Recognition ceremony honoring contributions

### Hub Dissolution Protocols

If dissolution is selected, assets are distributed according to these principles:

1. **Geographic Distribution**: Assets generated in specific regions remain in those regions
2. **Mission Alignment**: Recipients must demonstrate commitment to interfaith/inter-spiritual dialogue
3. **Ethical Verification**: Due diligence confirms recipients uphold framework principles
4. **Diversity Requirement**: Distribution must benefit initiatives across multiple traditions
5. **Capacity Confirmation**: Recipients must demonstrate ability to effectively utilize resources
6. **Transparency Mandate**: Distribution process and decisions fully documented

### Framework Evolution Alternatives

The framework may evolve in several ways short of full dissolution:

#### Governance Restructuring
- Modification of representation models while maintaining core principles
- Adjustment of decision-making processes to enhance effectiveness
- Rebalancing of central and regional authorities
- Introduction of new leadership selection methods

#### Mission Refinement
- Sharpening focus on specific impact areas
- Expansion to incorporate emerging challenges
- Adaptation to changing religious and spiritual landscapes
- Evolution of relationship with other governance domains

#### Structural Transformation
- Transition to different organizational models
- Integration with complementary governance frameworks
- Division into specialized successor initiatives
- Incorporation into broader governance structures

### Legacy Preservation

Regardless of outcome, the framework's legacy is preserved through:

1. **Knowledge Repository**: Documentation of methodologies, case studies, and lessons learned
2. **Relationship Networks**: Maintenance of connections between traditions
3. **Educational Resources**: Preservation of training materials and dialogue approaches
4. **Impact Documentation**: Record of framework contributions to global dialogue

### Review and Amendment of Sunset Clause

This sunset clause itself is subject to review every five years to ensure it remains fit for purpose. Amendments require:
- Advisory Board recommendation
- GCRSD approval by 75% majority
- Regional Hub approval by 2/3 majority

This structured approach to framework evolution ensures that the Religious & Spiritual Dialogue Framework remains a living system that can adapt, transform, or gracefully conclude its work rather than perpetuating structures that no longer serve their purpose. It embodies the principle that effective governance must include mechanisms for its own evolution or conclusion when necessary.
