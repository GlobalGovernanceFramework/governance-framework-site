## 4. Governance Structure

The Religious & Spiritual Dialogue Framework requires governance structures that exemplify the very principles it promotes. The following structure balances representation, effectiveness, and accountability while modeling constructive collaboration across diverse traditions.

### Global Council for Religious & Spiritual Dialogue (GCRSD)

#### Composition

The GCRSD consists of 40 representatives reflecting the global diversity of religious, spiritual, and ethical traditions:

- Representatives from established religious traditions (e.g., Buddhism, Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, Judaism, Sikhism)
- Representatives from indigenous spiritual traditions from all continents
- Representatives from non-theistic spiritual and ethical traditions (e.g., Humanism, Ethical Culture, philosophical traditions)
- Representatives from emerging spiritual movements and practices

Demographic mandates ensure diversity beyond tradition:
- At least 40% of seats held by women
- Minimum 25% of seats held by youth (under 30)
- Geographic distribution ensuring no region has more than 25% representation
- Representation from both institutional leadership and grassroots practitioners

#### Selection Criteria and Process

The GCRSD employs a hybrid selection model to ensure legitimacy across diverse contexts:

- 50% of representatives are elected by their communities through verifiable processes
  - For organized traditions: Selection through existing institutional structures with transparency requirements
  - For decentralized traditions: Selection through documented community processes (e.g., gathered attestations, community councils)

- 50% of representatives are nominated by established networks with demonstrated commitment to inclusive dialogue
  - Examples include: Parliament of World's Religions, United Religions Initiative, regional interfaith networks
  - Networks must meet transparency and diversity standards to qualify as nominating bodies

All representatives must demonstrate:
- Commitment to cross-tradition dialogue and collaboration
- Willingness to engage constructively with diverse perspectives
- Capacity to represent their tradition while building bridges to others
- Endorsement from recognized authorities or communities within their tradition

The Advisory Board oversees the selection process, ensuring adherence to diversity requirements and verification standards. All selection processes are documented and publicly accessible to ensure transparency.

#### Role and Responsibilities

The GCRSD serves as the primary governance body with responsibilities including:

- Setting strategic direction for the framework
- Approving annual work plans and budgets
- Overseeing regional hubs and working groups
- Ensuring accountability to framework principles
- Representing the framework in global forums
- Mediating disputes that arise within the framework
- Approving major partnerships and initiatives
- Commissioning evaluations and impact assessments

#### Decision-Making Procedures

The GCRSD employs consensus-based decision-making with structured protocols:

- Issues are first explored through dialogue to identify areas of agreement and concern
- Proposals are developed collaboratively with input from all perspectives
- Consensus is sought through structured facilitation
- When full consensus cannot be reached, a 75% supermajority is required for decisions, with dissenting views documented
- Critical decisions affecting framework foundations require an 85% supermajority

For disputes that cannot be resolved through normal deliberation:
- A neutral mediator, selected jointly by the Advisory Board and an external panel of ethicists, facilitates resolution
- Mediation follows a trauma-informed protocol that acknowledges historical wounds
- If mediation fails, the Advisory Board appoints a new mediator within 30 days via majority vote

#### Terms and Renewal

- Representatives serve three-year terms, staggered to ensure continuity
- Maximum of two consecutive terms for any individual
- Removal for cause requires 2/3 vote of the GCRSD following documented violations of framework principles

#### Policy Integration Committee

A specialized sub-committee of the GCRSD focuses on integration with other governance domains:

- Composition: 7-9 members with expertise in both religious/spiritual traditions and policy processes
- Role: Translate dialogue outcomes into policy recommendations for other governance frameworks
- Responsibilities:
  - Developing relationships with other governance domains
  - Creating accessible formats for sharing spiritual insights with policymakers
  - Tracking how religious and spiritual perspectives influence policy outcomes
  - Building capacity among religious and spiritual leaders to engage in policy processes

#### Accountability Measures

- The GCRSD undergoes a biennial relevance review conducted by the Advisory Board
- If participation drops below 60% for two consecutive years or systemic corruption is verified, a sunset clause may be invoked to reconstitute the framework
- Annual public reporting on activities, finances, and impact
- Term limits and rotation requirements prevent entrenchment of power

### Regional Hubs

#### Purpose and Function

Regional Hubs localize the framework's activities, ensuring contextual relevance and accessibility:

- Adapt global approaches to regional cultural contexts
- Provide culturally appropriate facilitation and translation
- Implement regional dialogue activities and training programs
- Connect local spiritual communities with global conversations
- Document regional wisdom traditions and practices
- Serve as first point of contact for new participants

#### Structure and Composition

Each Regional Hub is structured to reflect its specific context while maintaining core principles:

- 15-25 members depending on regional diversity
- Balance of institutional leaders and grassroots voices
- Representation of both majority and minority traditions in the region
- Sub-category quotas ensuring diverse demographics (e.g., gender, age, urban/rural)
- Co-leadership model with rotating chairs from different traditions

#### Accountability and Oversight

- Annual reporting to the GCRSD on activities and impact
- Regular evaluation against diversity and inclusion metrics
- Financial transparency requirements
- Clear dissolution clause: Hubs violating principles (e.g., corruption, exclusion) may be disbanded by a 2/3 GCRSD vote after investigation by a rotating third-party ombudsman group
- If dissolved for misconduct, 20% of redistributed assets must be allocated to reparations for affected communities

#### Knowledge Documentation

Each hub maintains documentation of local spiritual practices and wisdom relevant to governance challenges:

- Oral histories and traditional knowledge recorded with appropriate permissions
- Regional perspectives on global challenges
- Case studies of successful interfaith/inter-spiritual collaboration
- Context-specific applications of framework principles

### Advisory Board

#### Composition

The Advisory Board consists of 12-15 members:

- Scholars of religious and interfaith studies
- Ethicists from diverse traditions
- Practitioners with experience in dialogue facilitation
- Experts in governance and policy processes
- Representatives of marginalized communities

Members serve in individual capacity rather than representing specific traditions, focusing on process integrity rather than theological positions.

#### Functions

The Advisory Board provides independent oversight and expertise:

- Guides representative selection processes
- Approves mediator selections for dispute resolution
- Advises on crisis response procedures
- Oversees the ombudsman function for regional hubs
- Conducts biennial relevance reviews of the GCRSD
- Maintains a living directory of nominating networks for lesser-known traditions

#### Funding Ethics Committee

A specialized sub-committee focuses specifically on funding integrity:

- Reviews all major funding sources for potential conflicts of interest
- Ensures donor influence doesn't compromise representation
- Develops and monitors guidelines for ethical fundraising
- Reviews funding allocation for equity across traditions and regions

The Advisory Board maintains independence through:
- Staggered four-year terms
- Nomination by diverse sources including academic institutions, ethics organizations, and civil society
- Transparent selection criteria emphasizing expertise and impartiality
- Public disclosure of all potential conflicts of interest

### Working Groups

#### Purpose and Structure

Working groups focus on specific issues requiring dedicated attention:

- Small teams (5-10 members) allow for deep collaboration
- Time-bound mandates with clear deliverables
- Regular rotation of membership to maintain dynamism
- Co-leadership from diverse traditions
- Direct reporting to the GCRSD with quarterly updates

#### Core Working Groups

The framework establishes several standing working groups:

1. **Ethics Charter Development**: Creating and regularly updating the shared ethics document
2. **Climate Action Collaboration**: Developing joint approaches to environmental challenges
3. **Truth & Reconciliation**: Addressing historical tensions between traditions
4. **Intergenerational Dialogue**: Bridging elders and youth within traditions
5. **Policy Translation**: Converting spiritual insights into governance recommendations

#### Ad Hoc Working Groups

Additional working groups may be established for emerging issues or time-limited projects, with approval from the GCRSD.

### Governance Ecosystem Integration

The governance structure includes mechanisms for connecting with other frameworks:

- Liaison roles designated for each major governance domain
- Joint committees with related frameworks where appropriate
- Clear protocols for representing the framework in external forums
- Regular coordination meetings with other governance secretariats

This governance structure creates a balanced system that upholds the framework's principles while enabling effective action. By modeling transparent, inclusive governance within its own structures, the framework demonstrates the very approaches it seeks to promote in global governance more broadly.
