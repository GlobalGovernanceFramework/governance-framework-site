## Appendix G: AI Ethics Guidelines

As AI technologies become integral to dialogue facilitation and knowledge management within the framework, clear ethical guidelines are essential to ensure these tools support rather than undermine the framework's core principles.

### Core AI Ethics Requirements

**For AI-supported dialogue platforms:**

#### 1. Diverse Training Requirements
- **Multilingual models must be trained on diverse spiritual texts (e.g., Quran, Vedas, Stoic philosophy)** to prevent bias toward dominant traditions
- Training data must include:
  - Sacred texts from all major traditions
  - Contemporary and historical spiritual writings
  - Oral tradition transcriptions (with appropriate permissions)
  - Philosophical works from diverse cultural contexts
  - Multiple linguistic expressions of similar spiritual concepts
- Documentation of training sources must be publicly available
- Underrepresented traditions must be intentionally included in training datasets

#### 2. Bias Detection and Intervention
- **Algorithms must flag dominance patterns (e.g., 70%+ chat room contributions from one tradition)** to ensure balanced dialogue
- AI systems must monitor and report:
  - Disproportionate speaking time or contribution frequency
  - Systematic interruption patterns
  - Terminology dominance from particular traditions
  - Imbalanced affirmation or validation of different perspectives
- Flagged patterns trigger facilitator notification for human intervention
- Quarterly bias audit reports reviewed by the Advisory Board's tech ethics subcommittee

#### 3. User Autonomy Protections
- **Users may opt out of AI moderation for sensitive discussions** where cultural nuance requires human oversight
- AI systems must:
  - Clearly disclose their role in all interactions
  - Provide transparent explanations of recommendation rationales
  - Maintain human override options for all automated decisions
  - Preserve complete dialogue transcripts for human review
- Ritual or sacred discussions may be designated AI-free when requested

### Implementation Standards

#### Development Requirements
- AI systems must be developed through multi-tradition technical teams
- Spiritual leaders from diverse traditions must participate in design and oversight
- Testing must include communities with varying technological access and literacy
- Regular ethical review conducted by independent experts

#### Transparency Measures
- Documentation of all AI algorithms publicly available in accessible language
- Clear disclosure of limitations and potential biases
- Regular public reporting on system performance and incidents
- Open interfaces for third-party verification and testing

#### Data Governance
- Strict protocols for handling sensitive religious and cultural information
- Community ownership of tradition-specific data
- Informed consent requirements for all data utilization
- Right to deletion of contributions upon request

#### Accessibility and Inclusion
- Design prioritizing users with limited digital literacy
- Alternative interfaces for various abilities and preferences
- Offline functionality for regions with limited connectivity
- Support for languages beyond major global languages

### Specific AI Application Guidelines

#### Translation Systems
- Preservation of original metaphorical and cultural meaning
- Clear indication of translation confidence levels
- Alternative translation options for ambiguous concepts
- Human review for sensitive or contested terminology

#### Discussion Facilitation
- Balance between guiding dialogue and allowing organic exchange
- Recognition of culturally different communication patterns
- Avoidance of premature consensus or false agreement
- Sensitivity to tradition-specific discussion approaches

#### Knowledge Repository Management
- Accurate attribution and provenance tracking
- Context preservation for all documented wisdom
- Balanced recommendation algorithms for diverse perspectives
- Verification systems for doctrinal accuracy

#### Monitoring and Evaluation
- Regular testing for emergent biases
- Community feedback integration
- Continuous learning from application challenges
- Adaptation to evolving ethical standards

### Governance and Oversight

#### AI Ethics Council
- Diverse representation across traditions and technical expertise
- Regular review of AI applications and impacts
- Authority to recommend system modifications
- Public reporting on findings and recommendations

#### Incident Response Protocol
- Clear procedures for addressing AI-related concerns
- Multiple channels for raising issues
- Timely investigation and resolution processes
- Transparency in reporting outcomes

#### Continuous Improvement Process
- Regular ethical review cycles
- Integration of user feedback
- Adaptation to emerging ethical frameworks
- Documentation of lessons learned

These guidelines ensure that AI technologies serve as tools for enhancing rather than replacing human dialogue across traditions, maintaining ethical integrity while leveraging technological benefits for more inclusive and effective engagement.
