### AI & Digital Peace Ethics

While digital technologies offer powerful tools for peace, they also present unique risks requiring dedicated governance:

#### 1. Ethical Safeguards for AI in Peacebuilding
- **Bias Detection & Mitigation**: Systems addressing algorithmic discrimination in conflict analysis and prediction
- **Human Oversight Requirements**: Ensuring AI remains a tool supporting human decision-making in peace processes
- **Transparency Protocols**: Making AI-assisted conflict assessments understandable to affected communities
- **Sovereignty-Respecting Design**: Technology governance preventing external manipulation through peace technologies

#### 2. Digital Risks in Peace Contexts
- **Surveillance Governance**: Preventing digital monitoring tools from enabling authoritarian control
- **Data Protection in Vulnerability**: Enhanced safeguards for sensitive conflict-related information
- **Digital Manipulation Prevention**: Countering disinformation and digital provocation in fragile contexts
  - **Platform Dynamics & Conflict Amplification**:
    - **Disinformation Spread**: Echo chambers and viral misinformation campaigns can escalate tensions, as seen in Myanmar’s 2017 Rohingya crisis, where Facebook’s algorithms amplified hate speech, contributing to violence against minorities.
    - **Algorithmic Bias**: Coordinated hate speech campaigns exploit biased algorithms to target vulnerable groups, requiring proactive moderation and bias audits to mitigate harm.
    - **Mitigation Strategies**: Implement real-time content moderation protocols and cross-platform coordination to detect and neutralize malicious campaigns, as piloted in Ukraine’s Digital Ceasefire Monitoring (see [Media & Information Peace Capacities](/framework/docs/implementation/peace#media-information)).
- **Dual-Use Technology Governance**: Managing tools that can serve both peace and conflict purposes

#### 3. Digital Inclusion & Justice
- **Access Equity**: Ensuring marginalized communities can participate in digital peace processes
- **Technical Capacity Building**: Developing local abilities to shape, not just receive, digital peace technologies
- **Alternative Infrastructure**: Non-digital options running parallel to technological solutions
- **Digital Rights in Conflict**: Protecting online freedoms during security emergencies
- **Digital Education & Misinformation Resilience**:
  - Develop public education modules to build critical media literacy, teaching communities to identify disinformation tactics (e.g., deepfakes, bot-driven narratives) and cognitive biases.
  - Deploy community-based workshops, integrated with *Digital Media Literacy Campaigns* (per [Media & Information Peace Capacities](/framework/docs/implementation/peace#media-information)), to foster resilience in conflict-prone areas.
  - Use gamified apps and school curricula to engage youth in recognizing and countering misinformation, piloted in high-tech democracies like the U.S. (see [Context-Specific Implementation Roadmaps](/framework/docs/implementation/peace#context-specific-roadmaps)).

**Case Study**: The Digital Ceasefire Monitoring system developed for the Ukraine conflict demonstrates both the potential and risks of technology in peace processes. While successfully documenting violations through citizen reports and satellite imagery, the system faced challenges including verification difficulties, propaganda manipulation, and security risks for digital witnesses. The initiative responded by developing a comprehensive ethics framework addressing bias, security, and sovereignty concerns. This included regular bias audits of monitoring algorithms, secure submission channels for vulnerable witnesses, and local ownership of all data collected. The case illustrates how peace technologies require dedicated ethical frameworks addressing their specific conflict context risks.

**Implementation Tools**:
- Templates for bias audit protocols to assess AI and platform algorithms in peace contexts.
- Training modules for digital education workshops, focusing on misinformation resilience and media literacy.
- Ethical AI assessment frameworks to guide technology deployment in peacebuilding.
- Data protection guidelines for conflict-sensitive digital systems.

These and other implementation tools for AI and digital peace ethics are included in the *Peace & Conflict Resolution Seed Kit*, accessible via the [Tools Library](/framework/tools/peace).
