### Digital Peace Infrastructure

Digital technologies enable new approaches to peace governance, addressing conflicts in virtual and physical domains while requiring ethical safeguards to prevent harm (see [AI & Digital Peace Ethics](/framework/docs/implementation/peace#ai-ethics)).

#### 1. Cyber Conflict Prevention
- **Cyber Diplomacy Frameworks**: Agreements to prevent escalatory cyber-attacks during tensions.
- **Digital Confidence-Building Measures**: Transparency in state and non-state cyber activities.
- **Cybersecurity for Peace Infrastructure**: Protecting peace process data and communications.
- **Attribution & Accountability Systems**: Mechanisms to address cyber provocations without escalation.

#### 2. Technology-Enabled Early Warning
- **Participatory Sensing Networks**: Citizen-driven data collection on emerging conflict risks, adaptable to low-tech environments.
- **AI-Driven Conflict Prediction**: Ethical predictive analytics identifying potential flashpoints.
- **Social Media Monitoring**: Real-time analysis of digital sentiment to detect tensions.
- **Cross-Platform Data Integration**: Combining multiple data sources for comprehensive early warning.

#### 3. Digital Peace Platforms
- **Virtual Dialogue Systems**: Online platforms enabling cross-conflict engagement, with offline alternatives for accessibility.
- **Digital Peacekeeping Tools**: Technology supporting ceasefire monitoring and compliance.
- **Online Dispute Resolution**: Systems for resolving low-level conflicts in digital spaces.
- **Open-Source & Decentralized Peace Tools**:
  - **Blockchain-Based Truth & Reconciliation Logs**: Transparent, tamper-proof digital ledgers for testimonies and agreements, ensuring trust in post-conflict settings (e.g., Colombia’s peace process).
  - **IPFS-Based Community Reporting**: Decentralized, low-bandwidth reporting networks for secure conflict alerts in low-trust states.
  - **Open-Source Development**: Partner with global tech communities to create accessible tools on platforms like GitHub, ensuring affordability.

#### 4. Lightweight Fallback Versions for Low-Connectivity Areas
To ensure accessibility in areas with limited connectivity or digital literacy, the framework provides non-digital and low-tech alternatives:
- **SMS-Based Reporting Systems**: Enable communities to submit conflict alerts via text messages, requiring only basic mobile phones, as piloted in Somalia’s early warning networks.
- **Radio-Based Peace Messaging**: Use community radio to broadcast peace dialogues and misinformation resilience tips, effective in fragile states like South Sudan.
- **Paper-Based Dialogue Protocols**: Provide printed templates for community mediation and trust-building circles, adaptable to local languages and literacy levels (see [Traditional & Indigenous Peacebuilding](/framework/docs/implementation/peace#indigenous-integration)).
- **Community Training Modules**: Offer in-person workshops to teach peacebuilding skills, using storytelling and role-playing for low-literacy groups, as implemented in Yemen’s mobile peace units.
- **Integration with Digital Tools**: Ensure fallback versions sync with digital platforms (e.g., SMS data feeds into IPFS networks) when connectivity is available, maintaining scalability (see [Context-Specific Implementation Roadmaps](/framework/docs/implementation/peace#context-specific-roadmaps)).

**Case Studies**:
- **Estonia’s E-Governance for Peace**: Transparent digital platforms strengthened social cohesion, with offline backups for rural areas.
- **Ukraine’s Digital Diplomacy Success**: Social media mobilized global support, complemented by radio broadcasts for rural communities (see [Media & Information Peace Capacities](/framework/docs/implementation/peace#media-information)).
- **Myanmar’s Platform Failure**: Inaction on hate speech highlighted the need for fallback systems like community radio to counter disinformation in low-connectivity areas.

**Implementation Tools**:
- *[Low-Tech Reporting Guide](/framework/tools/peace/low-tech-reporting-guide-en.pdf)*: Design SMS and radio-based conflict alert systems.
- *[Paper-Based Dialogue Template](/framework/tools/peace/paper-dialogue-template-en.pdf)*: Structure offline community mediation.
- *[Blockchain Truth Log Blueprint](/framework/tools/peace/blockchain-truth-log-blueprint-en.pdf)*: Deploy transparent records.
- *[IPFS Reporting Design Guide](/framework/tools/peace/ipfs-reporting-design-guide-en.pdf)*: Set up decentralized networks.
