### Measuring Peace Governance Success

Effective peace governance requires metrics beyond the absence of violence:

#### 1. Structural Peace Indicators
- Positive peace metrics measuring factors that create peaceful societies
- Power-sharing and political inclusion assessments
- Resource distribution equity measurements
- Identity recognition and cultural rights fulfillment metrics
- Gender equality and women's participation metrics
- Youth inclusion and intergenerational equity measures

#### 2. Process Metrics
- Early warning system effectiveness assessments
- Response time to emerging conflicts
- Inclusive participation in peace processes
- Implementation rates of peace agreements
- Public trust in conflict resolution mechanisms

#### 3. Impact Measurements
- Direct violence reduction statistics
- Reconciliation and social cohesion assessments
- Economic recovery in post-conflict settings
- Return and reintegration of displaced populations
- Psychological well-being and trauma reduction
- Disability-Disaggregated Data: Tracking outcomes specifically for persons with disabilities, including their participation rates in peace processes, protection from violence, and access to justice mechanisms
- Intersectional Impact Assessment: Evaluating how peace initiatives affect individuals experiencing multiple forms of marginalization, with particular attention to disabled women, disabled indigenous persons, and other multiply marginalized groups

**Example Implementation**: The Institute for Economics and Peace's Global Peace Index and Positive Peace Index provide comprehensive measurements of both the absence of violence and the presence of attitudes, institutions, and structures that create peaceful societies. These multidimensional approaches, which evaluate factors from security apparatus functioning to equitable resource distribution, demonstrate how peace metrics can go beyond simple violence indicators to measure the foundations of sustainable peace.
