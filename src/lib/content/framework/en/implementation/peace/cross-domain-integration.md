### Cross-Domain Integration

Peace and conflict resolution cannot operate in isolation from other governance domains:

#### 1. Peace-Economic Integration
- **AUBI Implementation in Conflict Settings**: Using Adaptive Universal Basic Income to address economic drivers of conflict
- **Peace-Positive Investment Standards**: Frameworks ensuring economic development strengthens rather than undermines peace
- **Post-Conflict Recovery Integration**: Coordinated approaches linking security, governance, and economic rebuilding
- **Economic Peace Incentives**: Financial structures rewarding cooperation rather than competition

#### 2. Peace-Environmental Integration
- **Climate Peace Planning**: Integrated approaches to climate adaptation and conflict prevention
- **Environmental Peacebuilding Metrics**: Measuring how environmental cooperation contributes to peace
- **Green Transition Conflict Sensitivity**: Ensuring renewable energy and sustainability transitions don't create new conflicts
- **Ecological Peace Infrastructure**: Environmental projects designed to build peace between communities

#### 3. Peace-Technology Integration
- **Digital Peace Architecture**: Technological systems designed to strengthen rather than undermine peace
- **AI Ethics for Conflict Settings**: Specific guidelines for artificial intelligence applications in conflict zones
- **Peace Tech Innovation Ecosystems**: Support structures for technologies addressing conflict challenges
- **Digital Inclusion for Peace**: Ensuring technological access across conflict divides

**Case Study**: The Jordan River Basin cooperation between Israel, Jordan, and Palestine demonstrates successful integration across peace, economic, environmental, and technological domains. Despite intense political conflicts, technical cooperation on water management has continued, providing a foundation for broader peace efforts. By linking water governance with economic development, environmental sustainability, and innovative technology, this cooperation creates mutual benefits that have proven resilient despite political tensions.
