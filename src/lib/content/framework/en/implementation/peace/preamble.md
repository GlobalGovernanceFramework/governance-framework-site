## Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework for Multi-Level Governance

Addressing conflict is one of humanity's most persistent challenges, with traditional approaches often fragmenting along national boundaries, focusing on military solutions, or failing to address root causes. A global governance framework must provide effective mechanisms for preventing conflicts, resolving existing disputes peacefully, and addressing the systemic drivers of violence.

This implementation guide outlines how the Global Governance Framework applies to peace and conflict resolution across multiple scales, creating systems that can transform conflict from a destructive force into an opportunity for positive change and deeper cooperation.

The guide not only outlines theoretical approaches but provides practical tools for immediate application. The **Peace & Conflict Resolution Seed Kit** serves as a comprehensive starter package containing essential templates, protocols, and guidance for implementing peace governance at multiple levels. From community peace committees to digital conflict monitoring, the Seed Kit provides everything needed to begin transforming conflict into opportunity for positive change in diverse contexts.
