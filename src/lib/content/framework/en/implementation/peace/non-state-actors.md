### Hybrid & Non-State Actor Engagement

Modern conflicts increasingly involve non-state and hybrid actors, requiring specific governance approaches:

#### 1. Armed Non-State Actor Engagement
- **Differentiated Dialogue Frameworks**: Engagement protocols distinguishing between various non-state actors
- **Inclusive While Principled Negotiations**: Methodologies balancing inclusivity with human rights standards
- **Third-Party Intermediation**: Trusted intermediary systems for engaging groups resistant to direct talks
- **Incentive Structures**: Governance frameworks creating pathways from armed to political activity

#### 2. Disarmament, Demobilization & Reintegration (DDR) Governance
- **Combatant Transition Programs**: Systems helping fighters reestablish civilian identities and livelihoods
- **Community Acceptance Processes**: Frameworks facilitating reintegration of former combatants
- **Weapons Management Systems**: Governance for arms collection, destruction, and repurposing
- **Monitoring & Verification Mechanisms**: Transparent tracking of compliance with demobilization agreements

#### 3. Addressing Organized Crime & Conflict Economies
- **Criminal Justice-Peace Process Integration**: Frameworks balancing accountability with conflict resolution
- **Economic Alternative Development**: Governance systems supporting transitions from illicit economies
- **Cross-Border Security Cooperation**: Coordinated approaches to transnational criminal networks
- **Community Security Governance**: Local systems addressing protection needs without militarization

**Case Study**: The Colombia peace process with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) demonstrates comprehensive governance approaches to non-state armed actors. The process created specialized transitional justice mechanisms, territorially-focused reincorporation programs, and comprehensive rural reform addressing conflict's root causes. Special provisions for different kinds of combatants—commanders, rank-and-file, child soldiers, female fighters—demonstrated how differentiated approaches can effectively address complex non-state actor ecosystems. While implementation has faced challenges, the process created governance innovations including victim-centered truth commissions, rural development councils with ex-combatant participation, and community-based security mechanisms. This approach shows how peace governance can comprehensively address the complex reality of non-state armed groups while maintaining accountability for serious crimes.
