Economic realignment represents the fundamental transformation of economic systems from growth-obsessed, extractive capitalism toward regenerative, equitable systems that serve collective well-being and planetary health. This shift recognizes that consciousness governance requires economic structures that align with values of cooperation, sustainability, and social justice rather than competition, extraction, and accumulation. By reimagining how we create, distribute, and measure value, economic realignment creates the material foundation for consciousness governance to flourish at all levels of society, as envisioned in the [Manifesto: The Consciousness Accord](/framework/docs/consciousness#00-manifesto).

## <a id="purpose-and-economic-philosophy-foundation"></a>Purpose and Economic Philosophy Foundation

**Purpose**: To transform economic systems from extractive capitalism toward regenerative, cooperative models that prioritize collective well-being, ecological health, and equitable resource distribution while supporting the material conditions necessary for consciousness governance to thrive.

### Fundamental Economic Philosophy Shifts

**From Scarcity to Abundance Thinking**:
- Recognition that artificial scarcity is created by extractive systems and wealth concentration
- Understanding that cooperation and sharing can create abundance for all
- Shift from competitive hoarding to collaborative resource stewardship
- Belief that Earth provides sufficient resources when distributed equitably and used sustainably

**From Growth to Regeneration**:
- Moving beyond endless growth on a finite planet toward regenerative systems
- Focus on qualitative improvement rather than quantitative expansion
- Economic activities that restore and enhance rather than deplete social and ecological systems
- Circular and biomimetic economic models that eliminate waste

**From Individual to Collective Prosperity**:
- Understanding that individual well-being depends on collective health
- Economic systems designed for community resilience rather than individual accumulation
- Shared ownership and democratic control of economic resources
- Prosperity measured by community thriving rather than individual wealth

**From Extraction to Stewardship**:
- Economic relationships with Earth based on reciprocity and care
- Recognition of humans as part of ecological systems rather than separate from them
- Integration of traditional indigenous economic practices based on stewardship
- Seven-generation thinking in all economic planning and decision-making

### Theoretical Foundations

**Ecological Economics**: Integration of ecological principles and limits into economic thinking, recognizing economy as subset of ecology rather than separate system.

**Feminist Economics**: Including care work, household economy, and reproductive labor in economic analysis and valuation.

**Indigenous Economics**: Learning from traditional economies based on reciprocity, gift exchange, and relationship with land.

**Solidarity Economy**: Economic relationships based on cooperation, mutual aid, and shared ownership rather than competition and exploitation.

**Degrowth Theory**: Planned economic transition away from growth dependence toward sustainable scale and equitable distribution.

**Commons Theory**: Understanding and managing shared resources through community governance and stewardship.

### Economic Justice Integration

**Racial and Economic Justice**: Addressing how racism and colonialism created current economic inequalities and designing economic systems that repair historical harms.

**Gender Economic Justice**: Recognizing and valuing care work, addressing gender pay gaps, and supporting economic models that honor all types of contribution.

**Intergenerational Justice**: Economic systems that preserve and enhance opportunities for future generations rather than stealing from them.

**Global Economic Justice**: Addressing how colonial extraction and contemporary economic imperialism create global inequality.

**Climate Justice**: Ensuring economic transition addresses climate change while supporting frontline communities and workers.

### Values-Based Economic Framework

**Cooperation Over Competition**: Economic incentives that reward collaboration and mutual aid rather than winning at others' expense.

**Sufficiency Over Excess**: Economic systems designed to meet everyone's needs adequately rather than creating luxury for few and deprivation for many.

**Sustainability Over Short-term Profit**: Long-term thinking that preserves social and ecological systems rather than sacrificing them for immediate gain.

**Democracy Over Plutocracy**: Economic decision-making power distributed broadly rather than concentrated among wealthy elites.

**Care Over Commodification**: Recognizing care relationships and environmental stewardship as valuable economic activities rather than commodifying all aspects of life.

**Case Study (Real)**: Kerala, India's development model (1960s-present) demonstrates alternative economic priorities, achieving high human development indicators (literacy, health, life expectancy) with relatively low per-capita income through public investment in education, healthcare, and social services rather than pure economic growth, showing how different economic priorities can create better outcomes for collective well-being.

## <a id="well-being-economics-and-post-gdp-frameworks"></a>Well-being Economics and Post-GDP Frameworks

Moving beyond Gross Domestic Product (GDP) as measure of success toward comprehensive indicators that track genuine progress in human and ecological well-being.

### Limitations of GDP-Based Economics

**What GDP Measures vs. What Matters**:
- GDP counts all monetary transactions as positive regardless of their impact on well-being
- Environmental destruction, crime, inequality, and social breakdown can increase GDP
- Care work, volunteer labor, and household production are invisible to GDP
- Community resilience, happiness, and quality of life are not captured
- Sustainability and future generation impacts are ignored

**GDP's Role in Perpetuating Problems**:
- Growth imperative drives resource extraction and environmental destruction
- Inequality increases as GDP growth often benefits wealthy while harming poor
- Short-term thinking prioritizes quarterly profits over long-term sustainability
- Commodification pressure turns relationships and nature into market transactions
- Social problems become economic opportunities (crime creates jobs, pollution creates cleanup industries)

### Alternative Economic Indicators

**Gross National Happiness (Bhutan)**:
- Psychological well-being, health, education, cultural diversity and resilience
- Time use and work-life balance, good governance, community vitality
- Ecological diversity and resilience, living standards
- Holistic approach that balances material and spiritual development

**Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)**:
- Starts with GDP but adds income distribution, adds value of household and volunteer work
- Subtracts costs of crime, pollution, family breakdown, and inequality
- Includes changes in leisure time, lifespan of consumer durables, and infrastructure
- Measures depletion of natural resources and environmental damage

**Happy Planet Index**:
- Measures sustainable well-being by calculating life satisfaction and life expectancy per unit of ecological footprint
- Shows that high well-being is achievable with much lower resource consumption
- Highlights that wealthiest countries often have lower efficiency in converting resources to well-being

**OECD Better Life Index**:
- Housing, income, jobs, community, education, environment, civic engagement, health, life satisfaction, safety, work-life balance
- Allows users to weight different factors according to their values
- International comparisons that highlight different approaches to well-being

### Well-being Economics Implementation

**Government Policy Integration**:
- Budget decisions based on well-being impact rather than GDP growth
- Policy evaluation using well-being indicators and community-defined success
- Investment in social infrastructure (care, education, health) as economic priority
- Regulatory frameworks that prioritize social and environmental outcomes

**Community-Controlled Indicators**:
- Participatory processes for communities to define their own success measures
- Local indicators that reflect cultural values and community priorities
- Integration of traditional knowledge and indigenous indicators
- Youth and elder input on intergenerational well-being measures

**Business and Organization Application**:
- Triple bottom line accounting (people, planet, profit) for businesses
- Benefit corporation structures that legally require social and environmental consideration
- Cooperative and social enterprise models that prioritize community benefit
- Worker ownership and democratic governance in business organizations

**Individual and Household Economics**:
- Time banking and skill sharing systems that value non-monetary contribution

### Measuring What Matters Framework

**Social Well-being Indicators**:
- Community trust and social cohesion, crime and safety levels
- Mental health and life satisfaction, educational achievement and lifelong learning
- Cultural vitality and diversity, civic participation and democratic engagement

**Environmental Health Measures**:
- Air and water quality, biodiversity and ecosystem health
- Climate stability and carbon footprint, renewable energy usage
- Waste reduction and circular economy progress, sustainable transportation access

**Economic Justice Indicators**:
- Income and wealth inequality, poverty and basic needs satisfaction
- Worker rights and labor conditions, cooperative and community ownership
- Financial security and debt levels, local economic resilience
- Access to essential services and economic opportunity distribution

**Case Study (Real)**: New Zealand's Living Standards Framework (2018-present) shifted government focus from GDP to measuring financial/physical capital, human capital, social capital, and natural capital. The 2019 "well-being budget" allocated resources based on well-being outcomes rather than economic growth, prioritizing mental health, child poverty reduction, indigenous rights, and climate change, demonstrating how governments can operationalize well-being economics.

### Transition from GDP to Well-being Economics

**Policy Reform Strategies**:
