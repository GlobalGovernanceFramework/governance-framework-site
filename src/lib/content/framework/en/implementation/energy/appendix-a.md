## Appendix A: Existing International Frameworks

This framework builds upon and enhances a substantial foundation of existing international agreements, institutions, and initiatives. Understanding these existing frameworks is essential for effective implementation and integration of new governance approaches. This appendix provides an overview of key international frameworks relevant to climate and energy governance.

### United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC)

**Establishment**: Adopted in 1992 at the Rio Earth Summit, entered into force in 1994
**Participation**: Near-universal membership with 197 Parties
**Core Objective**: Stabilize greenhouse gas concentrations "at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system"

**Key Elements**:
- Establishes the Conference of the Parties (COP) as the supreme decision-making body
- Creates a framework for reporting national greenhouse gas inventories
- Introduces the principle of "common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities" (CBDR-RC)
- Provides the foundation for subsequent climate agreements and protocols

**Governance Significance**: The UNFCCC established the first comprehensive global framework for addressing climate change and continues to serve as the primary international forum for climate negotiations.

### Paris Agreement (2015)

**Establishment**: Adopted at COP21 in Paris, entered into force in 2016
**Participation**: 195 signatories with widespread ratification
**Core Objective**: Limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels while pursuing efforts to limit warming to 1.5°C

**Key Elements**:
- Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs): Countries establish their own climate targets and action plans
- Global Stocktake: A five-year cycle to assess collective progress
- Enhanced Transparency Framework: Regular reporting and review of emissions and implementation
- Climate Finance: Commitment from developed countries to mobilize financial resources for developing countries
- Technology Mechanism: Supports technology development and transfer
- Capacity Building Framework: Enhances capacity in developing countries

**Governance Significance**: The Paris Agreement marked a paradigm shift from top-down target setting to a hybrid approach combining bottom-up national commitments with global goals and review mechanisms.

### IPCC Assessment Reports and Special Reports

**Establishment**: The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was established in 1988 by the World Meteorological Organization and UN Environment Programme
**Participation**: Scientists from 195 member countries contribute to assessment processes
**Core Function**: Provide scientific assessments of climate change, its impacts, and potential response options

**Key Elements**:
- Assessment Reports: Comprehensive evaluations published approximately every 6-7 years
- Special Reports: Focused assessments on specific topics (e.g., 1.5°C warming, oceans and cryosphere)
- Technical Papers and Methodology Reports: Guidance for specific technical issues
- Summary for Policymakers: Accessible syntheses approved by government representatives

**Key Reports Informing This Framework**:
- Sixth Assessment Report (2021-2022): Latest comprehensive assessment
- Special Report on Global Warming of 1.5°C (SR1.5): Scientific basis for 1.5°C temperature goal
- Special Report on Climate Change and Land: Guidance on land-based mitigation and adaptation
- Special Report on Ocean and Cryosphere: Assessment of marine and ice-related climate impacts

**Governance Significance**: IPCC reports provide the scientific foundation for climate policy, establishing consensus understanding of climate change drivers, impacts, and response options.

### Kyoto Protocol

**Establishment**: Adopted in 1997, entered into force in 2005
**Participation**: 192 Parties
**Core Objective**: Reduce greenhouse gas emissions through binding targets for developed countries

**Key Elements**:
- Legally binding emission reduction targets for developed (Annex I) countries
- Commitment periods: 2008-2012 (first), 2013-2020 (second via Doha Amendment)
- Flexibility mechanisms: Emissions trading, Clean Development Mechanism, Joint Implementation
- Compliance system with consequences for non-compliance

**Governance Significance**: Though largely superseded by the Paris Agreement, the Kyoto Protocol established important precedents for binding climate commitments and market-based mechanisms.

### Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework

**Establishment**: Adopted at COP15 of the Convention on Biological Diversity in 2022
**Participation**: Agreement under the Convention on Biological Diversity with 196 Parties
**Core Objective**: Halt and reverse biodiversity loss by 2030, enabling recovery by 2050

**Key Elements**:
- "30x30" Target: Protect 30% of land and sea areas by 2030
- Restoration Target: Restore 30% of degraded ecosystems
- Sustainable Use: Ensure sustainable management of remaining production landscapes
- Resource Mobilization: Financial commitments for implementation
- Benefit-sharing: Framework for genetic resources and traditional knowledge

**Governance Significance**: Recognizes the interconnection between climate change and biodiversity loss, providing complementary targets that support nature-based climate solutions.

### Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)

**Establishment**: Adopted in 2015 as part of the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development
**Participation**: All 193 UN Member States
**Core Objective**: Provide a shared blueprint for peace and prosperity for people and the planet

**Relevant SDGs**:
- SDG 7 (Affordable and Clean Energy): Ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable, and modern energy for all
- SDG 13 (Climate Action): Take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts
- Related goals addressing poverty, food security, water, cities, consumption, and ecosystems

**Governance Significance**: The SDGs establish climate and energy action within a broader sustainable development context, highlighting interconnections with social and economic priorities.

### International Solar Alliance (ISA)

**Establishment**: Launched at COP21 in Paris in 2015, became a treaty-based organization in 2017
**Participation**: 124 countries, primarily from sunshine-rich regions between the Tropics of Cancer and Capricorn
**Core Objective**: Accelerate deployment of solar energy in developing countries

**Key Elements**:
- Aggregated demand approach for reducing solar technology costs
- Financial mechanisms to reduce risks and costs of solar investments
- Common standards and quality control protocols
- Capacity building for solar energy implementation
- Knowledge sharing and technology transfer

**Governance Significance**: Demonstrates new models of international cooperation focused on specific clean energy technologies and South-South collaboration.

### Mission Innovation

**Establishment**: Launched at COP21 in Paris in 2015
**Participation**: 23 countries and the European Commission, representing over 90% of global public investment in clean energy innovation
**Core Objective**: Accelerate clean energy innovation through increased government investment and enhanced collaboration

### Governance Gaps in Existing Frameworks

While these frameworks provide important foundations, they contain significant gaps that this Global Governance Framework seeks to address:

1. **Enforcement Mechanisms**: Most existing frameworks rely on voluntary compliance without robust enforcement tools.

2. **Finance Adequacy**: Current financial commitments fall short of needs, particularly for adaptation, loss and damage, and just transition.

3. **Integration Challenges**: Many frameworks operate in silos, lacking coordination between climate, energy, biodiversity, and development efforts.

4. **Equity Mechanisms**: Despite acknowledging equity principles, practical implementation of equity in existing frameworks remains limited.

5. **Non-State Actor Engagement**: Formal recognition and integration of non-state actors in governance remains underdeveloped.

6. **Technology Transfer**: Despite numerous provisions, barriers to effective technology sharing persist.

7. **Fossil Fuel Production**: Direct governance of fossil fuel extraction and production is largely absent from existing frameworks.

The Climate & Energy Governance Framework builds upon these existing international structures while addressing their limitations, creating a more comprehensive, effective, and equitable approach to planetary climate and energy challenges.
