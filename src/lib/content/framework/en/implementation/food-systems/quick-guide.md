The *Food Systems Framework Lite Guide* is a short, easy-to-use introduction to the *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework*, designed for farmers, indigenous communities, youth, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), local governments, and anyone eager to improve food systems. It summarizes the framework’s big ideas and gives simple steps to start making a difference in your community. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), this guide encourages you to join the movement for sustainable, fair, and strong food systems by 2035. It’s part of the [Start with the Seed Kit](/framework/tools/food-systems/seed-kit-en.zip) and complements the full framework’s [Introduction](/framework/docs/implementation/food-systems#01-introduction).

## What Is the Framework?
The *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework* is a plan to make food systems—how we grow, share, and eat food—better for people and the planet. It focuses on:
- **Sustainability**: Growing food in ways that help the environment, like regenerative farming.
- **Equity**: Making sure everyone, especially indigenous communities, women, and youth, benefits fairly.
- **Resilience**: Building food systems that can handle challenges like climate change or conflicts.

**Big Goals by 2035**:
- Cut hunger by 50%.
- Make 30% of farmland regenerative (eco-friendly).
- Train 5 million farmers, including in Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK).

*Accessible explanation*: This is a plan to grow food in a way that’s good for the Earth, fair for everyone, and ready for tough times, with goals like less hunger and greener farms.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 13 (Climate Action), and SDG 15 (Life on Land).

## Why It Matters
Our food systems face big problems:
- **Hunger**: Over 700 million people don’t have enough food.
- **Climate Change**: Farming can harm the environment, but it can also help fight climate change.
- **Unfair Systems**: Small farmers and indigenous communities often lose out to big companies.

The framework offers solutions, like using TEK to grow food better, changing rules to support small farmers, and sharing knowledge to make communities stronger. By acting now, you can help create a future where everyone has healthy food, and the planet thrives.

*Accessible explanation*: Food systems aren’t working well—many are hungry, and the planet is hurting. This plan helps fix that by making farming fairer and greener, and you can help.

**Alignment**: Supports [Theory of Change](/framework/docs/implementation/food-systems#04-theory-of-change).

## Key Actions to Get Started
**Purpose**: Simple steps to join the framework and make a difference in your community.

1. **Learn About Your Food System**:
   - Talk to farmers, community leaders, or local shops to understand how food is grown and shared in [Your Area].
   - Example: Ask, “What crops grow here? Are farmers struggling with drought?”

2. **Start a Small Project**:
   - Try a pilot project, like a community garden or regenerative farming on [e.g., 1 hectare].
   - Use the [Pilot Readiness Self-Assessment Tool](/framework/tools/food-systems/pilot-readiness-self-assessment-tool-en.md) to check if you’re ready.

3. **Work with Indigenous Communities**:
   - Partner with local indigenous groups to learn TEK, like traditional ways to save seeds or manage soil.
   - Use the [TEK Integration Template](/framework/tools/food-systems/tek-integration-template-en.md) to plan respectfully.

4. **Spread the Word**:
   - Share stories of local “food heroes” (e.g., farmers, youth) on social media or at community events.
   - Follow the [Advocacy Playbook](/framework/tools/food-systems/advocacy-playbook-en.md) for tips.

5. **Push for Better Rules**:
   - Ask local leaders to support green farming or fair trade with small farmers.
   - Check the [Policy Harmonization Toolkit](/framework/tools/food-systems/policy-harmonization-toolkit-en.md) for example laws.

*Accessible explanation*: Find out about local food, start a small farm project, learn from indigenous groups, tell others, and ask leaders to make fair rules.

**Alignment**: Supports [Implementation Mechanisms](/framework/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms).

## Tools to Help You
**Purpose**: Point you to practical resources to take action.
