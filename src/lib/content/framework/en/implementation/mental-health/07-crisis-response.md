Mental health crises—whether individual, community, or global—require immediate response that maintains human dignity, cultural sovereignty, and healing-centered approaches rather than defaulting to coercive control. This crisis response architecture ensures that emergency support strengthens rather than undermines community mental health systems, providing rapid relief while building long-term resilience.
