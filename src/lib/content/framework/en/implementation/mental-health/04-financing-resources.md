The transformation of global mental health requires not just new funding sources, but fundamental restructuring of how resources flowâ€”from top-down institutional control to community-led allocation, from profit-driven services to care-centered economies. This financing architecture ensures sustainable resources while maintaining community sovereignty over mental health investments and challenging the economic systems that contribute to psychological distress.

### â‰¥5% Mental Health Budget Allocation

**Enforceable minimum funding with community oversight**

National health budgets must reflect mental health as fundamental to overall health, not an optional add-on. This framework establishes binding minimum allocations with community control over spending priorities.

**Color-Coded Compliance System**:
- **ðŸŸ© Green Status**: â‰¥5% allocation + community-led spending + rights-based care implementation + cultural competency training
- **ðŸŸ¨ Yellow Status**: 3-5% allocation with improvement plan + community consultation process + policy reform timeline
- **ðŸŸ¥ Red Status**: `<`3% allocation + criminalized suicide + coercive practices + no anti-discrimination laws + insufficient training

**Path to Compliance Implementation**:
- **Year 1**: Policy reform eliminating discriminatory practices and establishing community oversight mechanisms
- **Year 2**: Budget reallocation achieving minimum 5% mental health allocation with transparent tracking systems
- **Year 3**: Workforce development integrating traditional healers, peer specialists, and community-based approaches
- **Ongoing**: Community-led monitoring ensuring funding serves healing rather than institutional interests

**Enforcement Mechanisms & Incentives**:
- **Trade Agreement Integration**: Mental health funding compliance linked to favorable trade terms and development assistance
- **International Solidarity Support**: Countries meeting compliance receive priority access to Global Mental Health Commons Fund resources
- **Technical Assistance Programs**: Non-compliant countries receive intensive support for policy reform and funding reallocation

**Framework Synergy Note**: This mandate system aligns with the Planetary Health Accord's tiered funding approach while incorporating the Disability Framework's emphasis on community-controlled resource allocation.

### Community Budget Participation

**Participatory budgeting for mental health funding**

Traditional budget processes exclude community voices from funding decisions. This framework requires meaningful community participation in mental health budget development and allocation.
