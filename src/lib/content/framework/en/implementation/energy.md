## 1. Introduction

### Purpose and Context

The climate crisis represents humanity's most urgent collective challenge, threatening ecosystems, economies, and communities worldwide. Despite three decades of international climate negotiations since the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, and global temperatures are on track to exceed dangerous thresholds. Meanwhile, global energy systems—responsible for approximately two-thirds of emissions—remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels despite the rapidly falling costs of clean alternatives.

This Climate & Energy Governance Framework builds upon and strengthens existing international mechanisms, including the UNFCCC, Paris Agreement, and IPCC assessment processes. Rather than replacing these foundations, this framework addresses critical gaps in implementation, enforcement, equity, and coordination that have hindered effective climate action. It recognizes that climate and energy challenges are fundamentally interconnected and require integrated governance approaches that span global to local scales.

The framework responds to mounting evidence that current governance structures are insufficient to deliver the pace and scale of transformation needed. It acknowledges that while the Paris Agreement established important principles and processes, its voluntary nature and limited enforcement mechanisms have not generated adequate ambition or accountability. Similarly, while the IPCC provides essential scientific guidance, translating this knowledge into coordinated policy action remains challenging.

By providing a comprehensive governance architecture with clear authority, responsibilities, and mechanisms, this framework aims to accelerate the transition to a climate-safe, equitable energy future while respecting national sovereignty and diverse development pathways.

### Scope and Vision

This framework addresses the full spectrum of climate and energy governance needs, encompassing:

- **Mitigation**: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors
- **Adaptation**: Building resilience to unavoidable climate impacts
- **Energy Systems Transformation**: Transitioning to clean, accessible energy
- **Finance**: Mobilizing and directing capital toward climate solutions
- **Justice**: Ensuring equitable burden-sharing and benefit distribution
- **Innovation**: Accelerating technological and social solutions

Our vision is a world that has successfully limited warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels while ensuring energy access for all. In this future, nations have transformed their economies to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 through just transitions that leave no one behind. Climate-resilient infrastructure, nature-based solutions, and adaptive capacity protect vulnerable communities from unavoidable impacts. Energy systems are predominantly powered by renewable sources, with energy efficiency maximized and universal access achieved.

This governance framework enables a world where climate action strengthens rather than constrains human development, where historical inequities are addressed, and where natural systems regenerate rather than degrade. It envisions governance that is democratic, transparent, and accountable, with meaningful participation from all stakeholders, especially those most affected by climate impacts and energy transitions.

### Key Definitions and Principles

To ensure clarity and shared understanding, this framework defines key terms as follows:

- **Net-zero emissions**: A state where greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere are balanced by their removal, resulting in no net contribution to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. This requires both deep reductions in emissions and enhancement of carbon sinks.

- **Climate finance**: Financial resources directed toward climate change mitigation, adaptation, and addressing loss and damage. These include grants, loans, guarantees, and other financial instruments from public, private, and blended sources.

- **Clean energy**: Energy sources that produce minimal or zero greenhouse gas emissions during operation. These include solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and nuclear energy. Fossil fuels, even with carbon capture and storage (CCS), are excluded unless independently verified to deliver net-negative emissions outcomes at scale.

- **Climate justice**: The recognition that climate change affects different populations unequally based on historical responsibility, vulnerability, and capacity, requiring equitable distribution of burdens and benefits in climate action.

- **Just transition**: A process that ensures the benefits of the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient future are shared widely, while also supporting those who may lose livelihoods, ensuring energy access for all, and addressing historical inequities.

These definitions underpin the framework's approach to climate and energy governance, providing a common language for diverse stakeholders across national, cultural, and sectoral boundaries.

## 2. Guiding Principles

The Climate & Energy Governance Framework is founded on six interconnected guiding principles that provide the ethical foundation and operational logic for all governance activities. These principles reflect both moral imperatives and practical necessities in addressing the climate crisis and energy transition.

### Sustainability and Circular Economy

At the core of this framework is a commitment to long-term ecological balance and resource preservation. Governance decisions must prioritize the health of natural systems and recognize planetary boundaries. This principle extends beyond merely reducing carbon emissions to encompass:

- **Ecosystem integrity**: Protection and restoration of biodiversity, forests, wetlands, oceans, and other critical ecosystems, aligned with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework's targets, particularly the protection of 30% of land and sea areas by 2030.

- **Circular resource use**: Moving away from linear "take-make-waste" models toward circular systems where materials and energy maintain their value and utility through multiple lifecycles. This includes circular approaches to renewable energy infrastructure (e.g., recyclable solar panels, wind turbines, and batteries).

- **Intergenerational responsibility**: Ensuring that governance decisions consider impacts on future generations and preserve their options and resources. This includes avoiding actions that create irreversible environmental damage or lock in high-carbon infrastructure.

- **Regenerative approaches**: Moving beyond sustainability as merely "doing less harm" toward actively restoring and regenerating natural systems through climate action and energy transitions.

Operationalizing this principle requires life-cycle analysis of policy impacts, regular assessment of sustainability outcomes, and integration of circular economy metrics in all climate and energy decision-making.

### Equity and Common but Differentiated Responsibilities

Climate change and energy transitions occur against a backdrop of historical inequities and vastly different capacities across nations, communities, and demographic groups. This framework acknowledges these realities and establishes equity as a foundational principle through:

- **Common but Differentiated Responsibilities and Respective Capabilities (CBDR-RC)**: Nations that have contributed most to cumulative emissions and have the greatest capacity to act must lead in emissions reductions, financial contributions, and technology sharing. This reflects both historical responsibility and current capabilities.

- **Procedural justice**: Ensuring all affected parties—particularly historically marginalized communities—have meaningful voice and representation in climate and energy governance processes.

- **Distributional justice**: Fair allocation of burdens, benefits, and resources in climate action and energy transitions, with particular attention to vulnerable populations including indigenous peoples, women, children, persons with disabilities, and low-income communities.

- **Intranational equity**: Recognizing disparities within countries and ensuring national climate and energy policies address domestic inequities in impacts and opportunities.

- **Gender-responsive governance**: Addressing the gender-differentiated impacts of climate change and ensuring women's leadership and participation throughout governance structures.

This principle requires governance mechanisms that center the needs and voices of those most affected by climate change while ensuring those with the greatest responsibility and capacity take proportionate action.

### Science-Based Decision Making

Effective climate and energy governance must be grounded in the best available scientific understanding of both natural and social systems. This principle commits the framework to:

- **Integration of IPCC findings**: Policies and targets explicitly based on and regularly updated to reflect the latest scientific consensus from IPCC assessment reports and special reports.

- **Precautionary approach**: Where scientific uncertainty exists, governance decisions err on the side of caution in preventing potentially irreversible harm, particularly regarding climate tipping points.

- **Transparent methodologies**: Clear articulation of scientific bases for targets, policies, and implementation approaches, enabling scrutiny and refinement.

- **Interdisciplinary knowledge**: Incorporating insights from natural sciences, social sciences, economics, and other relevant disciplines to address the complex, multifaceted nature of climate and energy challenges.

- **Indigenous and local knowledge**: Recognizing and integrating traditional ecological knowledge and community-based observations alongside conventional scientific approaches.

This principle requires governance bodies at all levels to maintain strong relationships with scientific institutions, create mechanisms for ongoing scientific input, and communicate scientific bases for decisions to all stakeholders.

### Cooperation and International Collaboration

Climate change is a global commons problem that cannot be solved without coordinated action across jurisdictional boundaries. This principle emphasizes that:

- **Multilateralism is essential**: Building on and strengthening the UNFCCC process, Paris Agreement mechanisms, and other international frameworks rather than fragmenting effort.

- **Regional cooperation accelerates progress**: Collaboration between neighboring countries on shared infrastructure, ecosystems, and resources creates efficiencies and enables more ambitious action.

- **Public-private partnerships drive implementation**: Effective governance facilitates collaboration between governments, businesses, civil society, and communities.

- **Technology and knowledge sharing**: Accelerated diffusion of clean energy and climate solutions across borders, with appropriate intellectual property frameworks that balance innovation incentives with global access.

- **Diplomatic engagement**: Climate and energy diplomacy as core functions of foreign policy and international relations, with dedicated diplomatic channels for resolving conflicts in these domains.

This principle requires governance structures that facilitate rather than hinder cooperation, creating platforms for dialogue, coordination mechanisms, and shared implementation frameworks while respecting national sovereignty.

### Adaptability

The climate crisis and energy transition are rapidly evolving challenges characterized by technological innovation, changing scientific understanding, and dynamic social and economic conditions. Governance must be able to adapt accordingly through:

- **Regular review and refinement**: Scheduled assessment of governance effectiveness with clear processes for updating approaches based on outcomes and new information.

- **Flexible implementation pathways**: While maintaining firm goals, allowing for diverse approaches to achieving them based on local contexts and emerging opportunities.

- **Scenario planning**: Anticipating multiple possible futures and developing governance responses for different trajectories of climate impacts, technological development, and socioeconomic change.

- **Resilience to political fluctuations**: Designing governance systems that can maintain momentum through changes in national leadership and policy priorities.

- **Learning orientation**: Treating governance innovations as experiments from which to gather evidence and improve approaches over time.

This principle requires building feedback mechanisms, monitoring systems, and revision processes into all governance structures, along with cultivating institutional capacity for adaptation and learning.

### Ethical Framework

Beyond specific principles, this framework is guided by a holistic ethical approach recognizing that climate and energy governance involves profound moral choices affecting current and future generations, human and non-human life, and the fundamental organization of societies. This ethical framework encompasses:

- **Recognition of intrinsic value**: Acknowledging that natural systems have inherent worth beyond their utility to humans, and that climate and energy governance should protect this intrinsic value.

- **Commitment to reparative justice**: Addressing historical harms through policies that not only prevent future damage but repair past injuries inflicted on communities and ecosystems.

- **Intergenerational solidarity**: Explicit consideration of impacts on future generations in all governance decisions, potentially including formal representation of future interests.

- **Indigenous rights and sovereignty**: Respecting indigenous peoples' rights to self-determination, free prior and informed consent, and traditional relationships with land, water, and resources.

- **Global citizenship**: Fostering recognition of shared humanity and planetary boundaries that transcend national identities, while respecting cultural diversity.

This ethical framework provides a moral compass for navigating complex trade-offs, setting priorities, and evaluating outcomes in climate and energy governance.

Together, these six guiding principles—sustainability, equity, science-based decision making, cooperation, adaptability, and ethical framework—create a foundation for governance that is both morally grounded and practically effective. They inform the design of governance structures, policy mechanisms, and implementation approaches throughout this framework.

## 3. Governance Structure

The Climate & Energy Governance Framework establishes a multi-level, interconnected governance architecture designed to balance global coordination with regional contexts and national sovereignty. This structure addresses key weaknesses in current climate and energy governance systems: insufficient coordination, inadequate implementation support, limited accountability mechanisms, and vulnerability to political shifts. The structure consists of three complementary levels working in concert to ensure effective, resilient, and equitable governance.

### Global Oversight Body

At the global level, this framework establishes a Climate & Energy Governance Council that builds upon and enhances existing international mechanisms while adding crucial new capacities.

#### Mandate and Functions

The Council serves as the apex coordinating body for global climate and energy governance with the following key functions:

- **Policy Coordination**: Harmonizing climate and energy policies across jurisdictions to prevent fragmentation, regulatory arbitrage, and carbon leakage.

- **Target Setting**: Establishing and regularly updating science-based global targets for emissions reductions, adaptation, and energy transition, informed by IPCC assessments.

- **Implementation Support**: Providing resources, technical assistance, and capacity building to enable effective policy execution at regional and national levels.

- **Compliance Monitoring**: Tracking progress against commitments through transparent, standardized reporting and verification systems that build upon and strengthen Paris Agreement transparency mechanisms.

- **Dispute Resolution**: Mediating conflicts between parties regarding climate and energy policies, implementation approaches, and transboundary impacts.

- **Emergency Response**: Coordinating international actions during climate-related crises and mobilizing resources for affected regions.

#### Relationship to Existing Structures

The Council integrates with existing international frameworks in the following ways:

- **UNFCCC Enhancement**: Working in concert with the UNFCCC and Conference of the Parties (COP) process, adding implementation capacity and compliance mechanisms while respecting the established legal framework.

#### Climate Emergency Provisions

Recognizing the potential for abrupt climate changes and tipping points, the framework includes emergency provisions:

- **Emergency Declaration Authority**: Power to declare a global climate emergency in response to extreme situations such as critical tipping point activation (e.g., accelerated ice sheet collapse or massive methane releases).

- **Rapid Response Powers**: During declared emergencies, expanded authority to coordinate and direct resources, implement temporary measures, and require specific actions from member states.

- **Safeguards**: Clear criteria for emergency declarations, temporal limitations on emergency powers, mandatory review processes, and multi-stakeholder oversight to prevent misuse.

#### Structural Safeguards

To prevent capture by powerful interests and ensure legitimacy, the Council incorporates:

- **Balanced Representation**: Membership reflecting both regional diversity and differentiated responsibilities, with dedicated seats for particularly vulnerable nations (e.g., Small Island Developing States).

- **Rotating Leadership**: Time-limited terms for key positions with geographic rotation requirements.

- **Transparency Requirements**: Public access to deliberations, decisions, and supporting data, with limited, clearly defined exceptions for sensitive information.

- **Independent Auditing**: Regular external review of Council operations, decisions, and impact by qualified third parties.

- **Stakeholder Oversight**: Formal roles for civil society, indigenous peoples, scientific community, and private sector representatives in monitoring Council activities.

### Regional Hubs

Recognizing the diversity of regional contexts and the importance of subsidiarity, the framework establishes Regional Climate & Energy Governance Hubs as intermediate coordination bodies.

#### Scope and Authority

Each Regional Hub will:

- **Contextualize Global Frameworks**: Translate global targets and policies into regionally appropriate implementation approaches, accounting for shared ecosystems, energy systems, and economic relationships.

- **Facilitate Regional Cooperation**: Coordinate cross-border initiatives such as regional power grids, carbon pricing systems, and ecosystem management approaches.

- **Support National Implementation**: Provide technical assistance, capacity building, and resource sharing to enhance national climate and energy governance capabilities.

- **Address Shared Challenges**: Develop region-specific solutions to common problems, such as just transition strategies for regions dependent on fossil fuel industries or adaptation approaches for shared climate vulnerabilities.

- **Monitor Regional Progress**: Track implementation across the region, identifying opportunities for acceleration and addressing compliance challenges before escalation to global level.

#### Composition and Structure

Regional Hubs will be established for major world regions (e.g., Africa, Asia-Pacific, Europe, Americas, Middle East and North Africa), with:

- **Member State Representation**: Formal representation from all nations in the region, with voting rights proportional to a formula balancing population, emissions responsibility, and vulnerability.

- **Subnational Integration**: Formal roles for cities, states/provinces, and other subnational governments in hub governance and implementation.

- **Civil Society Participation**: Structured engagement with regional civil society networks, including environmental organizations, labor unions, indigenous peoples' organizations, and youth movements.

- **Private Sector Engagement**: Regional business councils representing diverse economic sectors and firm sizes, with particular emphasis on clean energy innovators and just transition leaders.

- **Scientific Advisory Bodies**: Regional scientific committees providing contextualized climate and energy research, monitoring, and policy analysis.

#### Political Resilience Functions

A key innovation of Regional Hubs is their role in maintaining momentum during periods of national political backsliding:

- **Multi-Stakeholder Coalitions**: Building broad-based support for climate action and energy transition across political, economic, and social actors to withstand electoral shifts.

- **Subnational Advancement**: Supporting continued progress at city and state/provincial levels when national leadership retreats from climate commitments.

- **Knowledge Preservation**: Maintaining institutional memory, data resources, and implementation capacity during periods of reduced national engagement.

- **Diplomatic Pressure**: Exercising peer influence to encourage reengagement of reluctant national governments.

- **Alternative Implementation Pathways**: Developing non-state and subnational implementation channels that can maintain progress despite national policy reversals.

### National Implementation Units

While respecting national sovereignty, this framework establishes minimum standards and best practices for national climate and energy governance:

#### Core Functions

Each participating nation will establish or designate National Climate & Energy Implementation Units with:

- **Policy Development**: Translating international commitments into domestic legislation, regulation, and programs.

- **Cross-Sectoral Coordination**: Ensuring coherence across ministries/departments (e.g., energy, transportation, agriculture, finance, foreign affairs).

- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Facilitating meaningful participation from civil society, business, labor, indigenous communities, and other key stakeholders.

- **Monitoring & Reporting**: Tracking progress against NDCs and other commitments using internationally standardized methodologies.

- **Implementation Support**: Providing resources, technical assistance, and capacity building to subnational governments, businesses, and communities.

#### Sovereignty and Flexibility

The framework respects that nations will implement climate and energy governance in diverse ways according to their:

- **Governance Traditions**: Alignment with existing administrative structures, legal systems, and decision-making processes.

- **Development Contexts**: Appropriate approaches based on economic circumstances, capacities, and pressing development priorities.

- **Cultural Factors**: Consistency with cultural values, traditional knowledge systems, and social norms.

- **Geographic Realities**: Tailored strategies reflecting unique geographic conditions, resource endowments, and vulnerability profiles.

#### Fallback Mechanisms

To address the risk of implementation gaps at the national level, the framework includes:

- **Regional Oversight**: If national implementation falters, Regional Hubs may work directly with subnational governments and non-state actors to maintain progress.

- **Implementation Support Teams**: Technical assistance deployed to help nations overcome specific governance challenges without infringing on sovereignty.

- **Conditional Resource Access**: Tiered access to international climate finance and technology based on implementation effort and outcomes.

- **Transparent Accountability**: Regular public reporting on national implementation status, creating domestic and international pressure for improved performance.

- **Positive Recognition Systems**: Highlighting and rewarding successful national implementation approaches to create constructive competition and peer learning.

Together, these three governance levels—global, regional, and national—create a resilient, adaptive structure capable of driving consistent progress while accommodating diverse contexts and withstanding political fluctuations. The structure balances the need for global coordination with respect for sovereignty and recognition of regional diversity, addressing key weaknesses in current climate and energy governance frameworks.

## 4. Core Pillars

The Climate & Energy Governance Framework is structured around four interconnected pillars that together address the full spectrum of climate and energy challenges. These pillars—Climate Mitigation, Climate Adaptation, Energy Transition, and Innovation & Technology—form the substantive foundation upon which governance activities are organized. While presented separately, these pillars are deeply interrelated and require integrated implementation approaches.

### A. Climate Mitigation

Climate mitigation focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks to prevent dangerous levels of climate change. This pillar establishes clear targets and strategies for rapid decarbonization across all sectors.

#### Targets and Timeframes

Building on the scientific consensus and the Paris Agreement's temperature goals, this framework establishes:

- **Global Net-Zero Target**: Achievement of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with interim milestones of 50% reduction from 2020 levels by 2035 and 75% by 2040.

- **Sectoral Pathways**: Differentiated decarbonization timelines for key sectors based on technical and economic feasibility:
  - Power generation: Net-zero by 2040
  - Transportation: Net-zero by 2045

Their implementation requires coordinated governance across all levels—global, regional, and national—with active participation from all stakeholders.

## 5. Policy Mechanisms

The Climate & Energy Governance Framework requires robust, coordinated policy mechanisms to translate principles and goals into concrete action. This section outlines the key mechanisms through which governance will be operationalized, ensuring accountability, coordination, and effective implementation across jurisdictions and stakeholders.

### Legislation and Treaties

At the foundation of the governance framework is a system of binding legal instruments that create clear obligations, rights, and enforcement pathways.

#### Enhancing Existing International Law

Rather than starting from scratch, the framework strengthens and builds upon the existing architecture of international climate law:

- **Paris Agreement Enhancement**: While preserving the Paris Agreement's nationally-determined structure, the framework adds complementary provisions for:
  - Mandatory minimum ambition levels based on common but differentiated responsibilities
  - Standardized methodologies for target-setting and progress assessment
  - Stronger review processes with consequences for non-implementation
  - Legal clarification of the binding nature of procedural obligations

- **Treaty Integration**: Explicit coordination between climate agreements and other relevant international legal regimes, including:
  - Trade law (WTO/GATT compatibility of climate measures)

## 12. Conclusion

Together, we can realize a coordinated, equitable, and regenerative transformation of our global climate and energy systems—one rooted in justice, powered by cooperation, and inspired by possibility. The challenges we face are unprecedented, but so are our collective knowledge, technology, and determination. This framework provides not just a roadmap for survival, but a vision for thriving in harmony with our planet and each other.

### The Imperative for Action

The scientific consensus is unequivocal: we stand at a decisive moment for humanity and Earth's living systems. The climate crisis demands urgent, systemic transformation across all sectors and societies. This framework acknowledges the gravity of our situation while providing structured pathways toward solutions.

The transition to a climate-stable, clean energy future is not merely an environmental imperative—it represents the greatest economic opportunity of our time. By shifting from extractive models that concentrate wealth and harm ecosystems to regenerative approaches that distribute benefits and restore natural systems, we can address multiple intersecting crises:

- Climate destabilization that threatens communities worldwide
- Energy insecurity that leaves billions vulnerable
- Biodiversity collapse that undermines ecological resilience
- Economic inequality that frays social cohesion
- Political instability fueled by resource competition

Through integrated governance spanning local to global scales, we can transform these challenges into opportunities for unprecedented collaboration, innovation, and shared prosperity.

### Building on Foundations, Breaking New Ground

This framework builds upon decades of climate diplomacy, scientific research, and community-led solutions. It honors the foundational work of the UNFCCC, the Paris Agreement, and countless local initiatives while acknowledging that these efforts, though vital, have not yet catalyzed transformation at the pace and scale required.

By introducing robust enforcement mechanisms, equitable finance structures, and transparent accountability systems, the framework addresses critical gaps in existing approaches. It explicitly centers justice—ensuring those least responsible for climate change yet most vulnerable to its impacts have decision-making power and resource access.

The framework's innovations include:

- Integration of traditional ecological knowledge with cutting-edge science
- Binding mechanisms for climate justice and reparative action
- Protection of both human rights and rights of nature
- Structural safeguards against power imbalances and institutional capture
- Dynamic adaptation pathways responsive to emerging realities

These elements strengthen the governance architecture needed to navigate the complex challenges ahead.

### From Framework to Reality

A framework's value lies in its implementation. The transition from concept to concrete action requires sustained commitment from all stakeholders—governments, businesses, civil society, communities, and individuals. While ambitious, this framework is deliberately practical, offering specific tools, metrics, and approaches for real-world application.

Success depends on several critical factors:

- **Political Will**: Leaders at all levels must prioritize long-term sustainability over short-term interests, withstanding pressure from entrenched powers while building constituencies for change.

- **Public Engagement**: Citizens must remain actively involved in shaping and implementing climate governance, holding institutions accountable while contributing to community-level solutions.

- **Business Leadership**: The private sector must transform business models to align with planetary boundaries, moving beyond incremental efficiency gains toward regenerative practices.

- **Financial Transformation**: Capital must rapidly shift from fossil fuels and extractive industries to clean energy and circular economy solutions at unprecedented scale.

- **Technical Innovation**: While existing technologies can achieve significant progress, continued innovation remains essential, particularly in hard-to-abate sectors.

- **Cultural Evolution**: Ultimately, sustainable governance requires evolving cultural values beyond consumerism and extraction toward stewardship and sufficiency.

This framework provides the architecture for these transformations, but bringing it to life requires collective action across societies and sectors.

### A Living Framework

Climate and energy governance must remain adaptive and responsive to emerging realities. This framework is designed not as a static blueprint but as a living system capable of evolution. The implementation roadmap includes regular review cycles, feedback mechanisms, and adaptation protocols to ensure governance structures remain fit for purpose as conditions change.

The framework's emphasis on transparent monitoring, diverse stakeholder engagement, and inclusive decision-making creates the conditions for continuous learning and improvement. As implementation proceeds, governance approaches will be refined based on evidence of what works, emerging scientific understanding, and evolving social priorities.
