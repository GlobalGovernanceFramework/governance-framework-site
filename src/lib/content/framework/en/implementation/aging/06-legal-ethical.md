Elder vulnerability requires robust legal and ethical protections that safeguard rights while preserving autonomy and agency. Current systems often choose between protection and freedom, creating paternalistic structures that infantilize elders or weak protections that enable exploitation. Legal and ethical safeguards create comprehensive protection systems that enhance rather than limit elder agency, ensuring framework implementation serves elder dignity while preventing abuse, exploitation, and discrimination.
