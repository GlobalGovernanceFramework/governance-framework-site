Social isolation represents one of the most damaging aspects of current aging systems, with health impacts equivalent to smoking 15 cigarettes daily. Yet this isolation is not inevitableâ€”it results from age-segregated housing, arbitrary retirement cutoffs, youth-centric technology design, and cultural narratives that devalue aging. Social inclusion and intergenerational connection transforms communities from age-segregated silos into integrated ecosystems where elders and younger generations learn from each other, solve problems together, and create stronger communities through their collaboration.
