Healthcare for aging populations must transcend traditional medical models that pathologize aging to embrace comprehensive wellbeing systems that support thriving throughout extended lifespans. Simultaneously, elders represent humanity's most valuable source of environmental wisdomâ€”decades of direct observation about climate patterns, ecosystem changes, and adaptation strategies. This section integrates healthcare innovation with climate wisdom recognition, creating systems where elder health and environmental knowledge strengthen communities while advancing longevity research that benefits all generations.
