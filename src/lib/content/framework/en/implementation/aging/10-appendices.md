### Core Framework Terms

**Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)**: Flexible income system for elders that adjusts based on health status, care needs, and ongoing contributions including caregiving, mentorship, cultural preservation, climate wisdom, and community work. Unlike traditional Universal Basic Income, AUBI recognizes and rewards ongoing elder contributions while providing economic security.

**Agency**: The capacity for elders to act independently, make free choices, and control their own lives including decisions about care, living arrangements, technology use, and community participation. Framework implementation prioritizes elder agency as the foundation of all support systems.

**Ageism**: Stereotyping, prejudice, and discrimination against people based on their age, particularly affecting older adults. Includes institutional ageism in employment, healthcare, and social systems, as well as interpersonal ageism in daily interactions and cultural representations.

**Climate Adaptation Councils**: Elder-led community bodies developing resilience strategies based on decades of environmental observation and traditional ecological knowledge. These councils integrate elder environmental wisdom with contemporary climate science for community adaptation planning.

**Climate Wisdom Keepers**: Recognition of elders as holders of essential environmental knowledge accumulated through 50-80 years of direct observation of weather patterns, seasonal changes, ecosystem shifts, and historical environmental events. This knowledge is systematically documented and integrated into climate adaptation planning.

**Councils of Wisdom Keepers**: Formal governance roles utilizing elder expertise in community decision-making, environmental policy, technology oversight, and cultural preservation. These councils ensure elder wisdom influences policy development and community planning.

**Elder Ambassador**: Trained elder advocate representing diverse cultural, economic, and geographic contexts who leads framework implementation, provides community education, and supports political organizing. Ambassadors receive AUBI recognition for their community contribution.

**Elder Data Sovereignty**: Elder community control over personal and collective data including how information is collected, stored, shared, and used. Includes granular consent mechanisms and community benefit requirements for all data use.

**Elder Economic Zones**: Designated geographic areas with special incentives for age-friendly businesses, elder-led innovation, and intergenerational economic cooperation. These zones provide infrastructure, tax incentives, and support services for elder economic participation.

**Elder Innovation Hubs**: Physical and virtual spaces where elders prototype solutions to aging-related challenges, develop businesses, and collaborate with younger generations. Hubs provide accessible technology, workshop facilities, business development support, and intellectual property protection.

**Elder Political Coalitions**: Organized elder voting groups advocating for aging rights, AUBI implementation, and framework policies. These coalitions target municipal elections, develop aging policy platforms, and build intergenerational alliances.

**Elder Wellbeing Index**: Comprehensive measurement system assessing Purpose (meaningful activity), Connection (social integration), Agency (self-determination), and Wisdom Utilization (knowledge application) rather than simply measuring absence of problems.

**Intergenerational Programming**: Structured activities and ongoing relationships connecting elders with younger generations for mutual learning, problem-solving, and community building. Programs emphasize reciprocal benefit rather than one-way service provision.

**Lifelong Contribution Ledger**: Blockchain-based system documenting non-market contributions throughout life with particular emphasis on post-retirement activities. Used for AUBI contribution recognition while protecting privacy and elder autonomy.

**Mutual Care Networks**: Elder-led systems where elders provide care to each other through democratic cooperatives and peer support systems. Networks integrate with professional care workers while maintaining elder ownership and control.

**Regenerative Economics**: Economic systems that strengthen through elder participation rather than being strained by aging populations. These systems activate elder wisdom, innovation, and social networks to create value while providing security and purpose.

### Governance and Political Terms

**Elder Cooperative**: Democratic governance structure where elders make decisions about their own support systems through participatory budgeting, service provider selection, and policy development. Cooperatives operate at neighborhood, municipal, and regional levels.

**Nested Governance**: Interconnected decision-making systems from local elder cooperatives to global coordination, enabling elder leadership at every level while facilitating resource sharing and knowledge exchange across communities.

**Participatory Budgeting**: Democratic process where elder communities directly control significant portions of aging-related public budgets, including priority setting, resource allocation, and program evaluation.

**Rights of Aging Beings Charter**: International legal framework establishing fundamental rights for aging populations including economic security, meaningful occupation, healthcare access, social connection, technology dignity, and end-of-life autonomy.

**Silver Migration Corridors**: Cross-border agreements enabling elder mobility for retirement, family connection, climate adaptation, and community choice while maintaining AUBI benefits and support continuity.

### Technology and Innovation Terms

**Cognitive-Adaptive Interfaces**: Technology design that adjusts complexity, interaction methods, and support based on user cognitive load, preferences, and changing abilities. Includes multi-modal interaction (voice, touch, gesture) and error tolerance features.

**Digital Dignity**: Technology design and policy principles ensuring elder respect, autonomy, and choice in digital interactions. Includes privacy by design, opt-out protections, and freedom from digital surveillance or manipulation.

**Elder-First Technology**: Technology designed with elder accessibility, dignity, and autonomy as primary considerations rather than afterthoughts. Includes cognitive adaptivity, multi-modal access, and elder community oversight of development.

**Technology Governance Boards**: Elder-majority committees overseeing technology deployment affecting aging populations, including AI ethics, data privacy, accessibility standards, and innovation priorities. Boards have enforcement authority and community accountability.

### Health and Care Terms

**Aging in Place**: Living in one's own home and community safely, independently, and comfortably regardless of age, income, or ability level. Supported through home modifications, community services, and technology assistance.

**Geriatric Care**: Healthcare specifically designed for aging populations addressing multiple chronic conditions, medication management, cognitive changes, and quality of life priorities rather than only treating individual diseases.

**Healthspan**: The period of life spent in good health, free from chronic diseases and disabilities of aging. Framework emphasis on extending healthspan rather than just lifespan through prevention, community support, and elder agency.

**Palliative Care**: Specialized medical care focused on providing relief from symptoms and stress of serious illness, improving quality of life for both elder and family, available alongside curative treatment.

**Telemedicine**: Healthcare delivery through technology including video consultations, remote monitoring, and digital health management designed with elder accessibility and choice as central considerations.

### Economic and Financial Terms

**Aging Impact Bonds**: Financial instruments where investors fund aging support programs and receive returns based on successful outcomes including elder wellbeing improvement and healthcare cost reduction.

**Automation Tax**: Progressive taxation on productivity gains from automation and artificial intelligence that displace elder workers, with revenue supporting AUBI and aging support systems.

**Green AUBI**: Additional AUBI payments recognizing elder contributions to environmental protection, climate adaptation, and sustainability initiatives including traditional ecological knowledge documentation.

**Longevity Bonds**: Financial instruments generating returns based on successful aging outcomes and healthspan extension, linking investment returns to elder community wellbeing rather than only mortality rates.

**Time Banking**: Community exchange system where elders provide services and receive credits for future support, enabling skill sharing and mutual aid without monetary transactions.

### Cultural and Social Terms

**Ageism Interruption**: Skills and practices for recognizing and countering age-based stereotypes and discrimination in interpersonal interactions, workplace practices, and cultural representations.

**Cultural Sovereignty**: Community authority to maintain, adapt, and transmit cultural traditions and practices according to community values rather than external impositions. Particularly important for Indigenous elder communities.

**Death with Dignity**: End-of-life autonomy including choice about medical treatment, dying location, family involvement, and assisted dying where legally available. Emphasizes elder control and cultural respect.

**Intergenerational Justice**: Fairness across age groups including recognition of elder contribution to current prosperity and responsibility for creating systems serving future elders (everyone currently younger).

**Legacy Creation**: Programs and processes helping elders document life stories, share wisdom, create meaningful contributions, and prepare for death as life completion rather than failure.

**Wisdom Utilization**: Systematic integration of elder knowledge and experience in community decision-making, problem-solving, and innovation rather than marginalizing elder expertise.
