## Tier 1: Urgent Global Stability & Justice

This tier includes the most urgent domains of global governanceâ€”areas where failure to act can lead to irreversible harm, large-scale human suffering, or systemic collapse. These frameworks focus on core needs like peace, healthcare, justice, food security, and climate action. They aim to stabilize our world, reduce inequality, and build resilience where it is most needed.
