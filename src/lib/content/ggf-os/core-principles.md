These principles guide GGF's internal operations, designed to enable collective flow and reduce egoic attachment. They serve as both operational guidelines and consciousness practices, creating conditions for the highest expression of human collaborative capacity.

## <a id="radical-transparency"></a>Radical Transparency

All non-private operational data—finances, decision logs, project roadmaps—are publicly accessible via platforms like OpenCollective.

**Beyond Accountability**: Radical transparency is not merely about preventing corruption or ensuring accountability, though it serves those functions. It is a practice of collective consciousness that dissolves the opacity that enables ego-driven manipulation and creates the conditions for genuine collective intelligence to emerge.

**What Is Transparent**:
- **Financial flows**: All income, expenditures, budget allocations, and financial decisions
- **Decision processes**: Complete records of proposals, discussions, voting, and rationales
- **Project development**: Roadmaps, progress updates, challenges, and pivots
- **Governance evolution**: Changes to protocols, lessons learned, and adaptive modifications
- **Success and failure metrics**: LMCI indicators, effectiveness measures, and honest assessments

**What Remains Private**:
- **Personal information**: Individual contributor details beyond their chosen public identity
- **Confidential communications**: Personal conflicts, health information, family circumstances
- **Strategic information**: Temporary confidentiality for negotiations or security-sensitive matters
- **Third-party confidentiality**: Information shared by partners under confidentiality agreements

**Implementation Practices**:
- **Real-time disclosure**: Financial transactions and major decisions posted within 48 hours
- **Accessible formats**: Information presented in multiple formats for different audiences and accessibility needs
- **Proactive sharing**: Regular public updates rather than reactive disclosure upon request
- **Context provision**: Not just data dumps, but information with sufficient context for understanding

**Challenges and Solutions**:
- **Information overwhelm**: Curated summaries and multiple access levels prevent data overload
- **Competitive disadvantage**: Transparency as a competitive advantage, attracting aligned partners and deterring misaligned ones
- **Privacy concerns**: Clear protocols distinguishing personal privacy from operational transparency
- **Misinterpretation**: Regular community education about how to interpret shared information

**Consciousness Practice**: Radical transparency serves as a practice of letting go of control and trusting collective wisdom. It requires courage to be seen fully and wisdom to share information in ways that serve rather than harm.

## <a id="subsidiarity-polycentrism"></a>Subsidiarity & Polycentrism

GGF is a modular network of autonomous Working Groups (Labs). Decision-making is localized to Labs, with a Stewards Circle coordinating network-wide functions.

**Beyond Decentralization**: Subsidiarity goes deeper than decentralization. It embodies the principle that decisions should be made at the most local level capable of addressing them effectively. This honors both efficiency and human agency, ensuring people affected by decisions have maximum appropriate influence over them.

**Subsidiarity in Practice**:
- **Lab autonomy**: Each Lab manages its projects, budgets, and teams within GGF-OS principles
- **Local solutions**: Problems addressed at the level where they arise when possible
- **Escalation protocols**: Clear pathways for issues that require broader coordination
- **Resource allocation**: Maximum local control over resources with network-level coordination for shared needs

**Polycentrism Principles**:
- **Multiple centers**: No single point of control or failure
- **Networked coordination**: Voluntary cooperation rather than hierarchical command
- **Diverse approaches**: Different Labs can experiment with different methods for similar challenges
- **Emergent order**: Network-level coherence emerging from local intelligence rather than central planning

**Coordination Mechanisms**:
- **Stewards Circle**: Representatives from each Lab coordinating network-wide functions
- **Shared protocols**: Common frameworks that enable interoperability without centralized control
- **Resource sharing**: Mutual aid and resource exchange between autonomous units
- **Information flows**: Transparent sharing of learnings, challenges, and innovations

**Benefits**:
- **Resilience**: No single point of failure; network survives and adapts even if components fail
- **Innovation**: Multiple experiments increase collective learning and adaptation speed
- **Engagement**: People more invested in decisions they have genuine influence over
- **Cultural adaptation**: Local implementations can adapt to specific cultural contexts

**Challenges and Safeguards**:
- **Coordination complexity**: Clear protocols and communication channels prevent fragmentation
- **Quality consistency**: Shared standards and peer review maintain network coherence
- **Resource inequity**: Mutual aid mechanisms and resource sharing protocols
- **Mission drift**: Regular alignment processes and shared principles maintain coherence

**Consciousness Practice**: Subsidiarity requires letting go of the need to control outcomes while maintaining commitment to shared purpose. It practices trust in distributed intelligence and the courage to allow emergence.

## <a id="direct-deliberative-participation"></a>Direct & Deliberative Participation

All members have a voice. Decision-making uses a tiered model: Consensus for charter amendments, Consent for operational decisions, Individual autonomy for personal tasks. Digital tools like Loomio and Pol.is enable scalable deliberation.

**Beyond Majority Rule**: Direct and deliberative participation transcends simple voting mechanisms to create conditions for genuine collective intelligence. The goal is not just to aggregate preferences but to enable collective wisdom to emerge through quality deliberation.

**Tiered Decision-Making Model**:

**Consensus** (for charter amendments and fundamental changes):
- **Process**: Extended deliberation until all voices are heard and integrated
- **Standard**: Everyone can live with the decision, even if not their first preference
- **Safeguards**: Time limits, facilitation support, and fallback to super-majority if consensus proves impossible
- **Purpose**: Ensures fundamental changes have broad buy-in and integration

**Consent** (for operational decisions):
- **Process**: Proposal, clarification, objections, modification, approval
- **Standard**: No reasoned objections that haven't been addressed
- **Speed**: Decisions within 14 days unless extended by consent
- **Purpose**: Efficient decision-making while ensuring all voices are heard

**Individual Autonomy** (for personal tasks and contributions):
- **Scope**: How individuals contribute their time, energy, and skills
- **Boundaries**: Must align with Lab purpose and GGF-OS principles
- **Support**: Coaching, resources, and feedback available but not mandated
- **Purpose**: Maximum individual agency within collective framework

**Digital Deliberation Tools**:

**Consciousness Practice**: Deliberative participation requires listening deeply, speaking authentically, and holding space for perspectives different from our own. It practices collective intelligence as a higher form of knowing.

## <a id="epistemic-humility-open-inquiry"></a>Epistemic Humility & Open Inquiry

We foster curiosity over certainty. An internal "Office of the Adversary" challenges assumptions, with rotating contributors selected via open nomination and consent-based processes, intervening at least quarterly to critique strategies, propose creative alternatives, and ensure balance between critique and collaboration. Interventions may be anonymous to encourage candid feedback. The Office operates as a rotating function, potentially integrated with Guardian Council responsibilities, to maintain agility.

**Beyond Being Right**: Epistemic humility recognizes that our knowledge is always partial, our perspectives limited, and our certainties often illusions. In a complex, rapidly changing world, the capacity to learn and adapt matters more than being right in any given moment.

**Practices of Epistemic Humility**:
- **Versioning everything**: All frameworks, documents, and decisions explicitly versioned to encourage iteration
- **Explicit assumptions**: Making underlying assumptions visible and available for questioning
- **Multiple perspectives**: Actively seeking diverse viewpoints, especially those that challenge dominant thinking

**Consciousness Practice**: Ethical tooling requires mindfulness about how technology shapes consciousness and the courage to choose values alignment over convenience when they conflict.

## <a id="graceful-obsolescence"></a>Graceful Obsolescence

GGF is a scaffold, not a monument. A "Sunset Protocol" ensures dissolution or transition when the mission is fulfilled, with knowledge transfer via open-source licensing for long-term projects.

**Beyond Institutional Perpetuation**: Most organizations develop self-preservation instincts that outlive their usefulness. Graceful obsolescence builds in the wisdom to recognize when an organization's purpose has been fulfilled and the grace to dissolve or transform appropriately.

**Scaffold Metaphor**: The GGF exists to enable the construction of better governance systems. Like scaffolding around a building under construction, its purpose is to support the creation of something beyond itself, not to become a permanent fixture.

- **New opportunity focus**: Emphasizing opportunities for contributors in post-GGF contexts

**Consciousness Practice**: Graceful obsolescence requires profound non-attachment and trust in larger processes. It practices the wisdom of impermanence and the courage to let go of forms when they no longer serve.

## <a id="principle-of-reversibility"></a>Principle of Reversibility

Decisions are reversible where possible, with review periods and rollback plans to adapt to unintended consequences, supporting epistemic humility.

**Beyond Permanent Commitment**: In a complex, rapidly changing world, the consequences of decisions often differ from expectations. The Principle of Reversibility creates space for learning and adaptation by designing decisions to be modifiable when new information emerges.

**Reversibility Design Principles**:

## <a id="principle-of-reciprocal-gifting"></a>Principle of Reciprocal Gifting

The GGF operates within a gift economy ethos. We recognize that contributions are gifts of time, energy, and wisdom to the commons. The GGF, in turn, reciprocates by gifting back to its contributors through open access to knowledge, "Growth Support" opportunities, and by stewarding the collective work for planetary benefit. This principle fosters a non-transactional culture of mutual support.

**Beyond Market Economics**: The Principle of Reciprocal Gifting challenges the transactional logic that dominates most organizational relationships. Instead of simple exchanges ("I give X, you give Y"), it creates flows of mutual support that strengthen the whole while honoring individual contributions.

**Gift Economy Principles**:
- **Abundance mindset**: Operating from the assumption that there is enough to go around when we share wisely
- **Intrinsic motivation**: Supporting contributions that arise from genuine care and interest rather than external reward
- **Mutual flourishing**: Ensuring that both individual contributors and the collective benefit from participation
- **Non-commodification**: Treating knowledge, wisdom, and care as gifts rather than commodities to be hoarded or sold

**Forms of Gifting to the Commons**:
- **Time and energy**: Hours spent in meetings, project work, and collaboration
- **Knowledge and skills**: Expertise, experience, and specialized capabilities shared freely
