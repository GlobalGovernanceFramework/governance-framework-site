## 3.1 Traditional Rights

The framework fully incorporates established human rights standards, including:

- **Civil and Political Rights**: Freedom of expression, association, religion, and belief; right to fair trial; freedom from torture and arbitrary detention; political participation rights; and protection from discrimination.

- **Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights**: Right to education, healthcare, housing, food security, work, and cultural expression.

These traditional rights remain the foundation of our framework, with additional attention to implementing them across different developmental stages and cultural contexts.

**Indigenous Rights** receive explicit recognition, honoring the sovereignty, knowledge systems, and spiritual custodianship of land held by Indigenous peoples. These rights include:

- Self-determination and autonomy in governance
- Protection of cultural heritage and traditional knowledge
- Free, prior, and informed consent for actions affecting Indigenous territories
- Recognition of unique relationships with ancestral lands and waters
- Preservation and revitalization of languages, customs, and spiritual practices

When conflicts arise between rights categories, the framework employs a principled hierarchy that prioritizes survival needs over autonomy rights in crisis situations, while working toward solutions that ultimately respect both.
