The legal transformation of mental health requires more than policy reform—it demands a fundamental reimagining of law itself from a tool of social control to an instrument of liberation and healing. This framework establishes legal architectures that protect consciousness exploration, honor traditional healing authority, and eliminate coercive practices while ensuring access to culturally-responsive care as a fundamental human right.

### Sunset Clauses for Coercive Practices

**Systematic elimination of forced psychiatric interventions**

Rather than gradual reform, this framework establishes clear timelines for ending all coercive mental health practices, with sunset clauses that automatically terminate legal authority for forced treatment unless explicitly renewed through community-led review processes.

**5-Year Phase-Out Timeline**:
- **Year 1**: Immediate ban on new involuntary commitments except for clear, imminent danger with 72-hour maximum holds
- **Year 2**: 50% reduction in existing involuntary hold capacity with mandatory community alternatives
- **Year 3**: Elimination of forced medication except in medical emergencies with judicial oversight
- **Year 4**: Transition to supported decision-making models with peer advocacy in all psychiatric settings
- **Year 5**: Complete elimination of involuntary psychiatric interventions, replaced by crisis support and community-led alternatives

**Deinstitutionalization Transition Packages**:
- **Housing First Implementation**: Guaranteed housing with mental health support for all individuals transitioning from institutional settings
- **Peer Support Networks**: Trained peer specialists providing 24/7 crisis support and community connection
- **Traditional Healing Access**: Culturally-appropriate healing options including indigenous practices, spiritual counseling, and somatic approaches
- **Economic Security**: Universal basic income or guaranteed employment for transition support

**Framework Synergy Note**: This systematic approach aligns with the Disability Freedom Framework's institutional abolition strategy while incorporating trauma-informed transition support.

### Consciousness-Inclusive Legal Protections

**Legal recognition of spiritual and mystical experiences as non-pathological**

Traditional legal frameworks criminalize or pathologize altered states of consciousness, spiritual experiences, and non-ordinary ways of being. This framework creates legal protections for consciousness exploration and spiritual emergency support.

- **Religious and Spiritual Freedom**: Protection for traditional healing practices involving altered states, including indigenous ceremonies and contemplative practices
- **Provider Immunity**: Legal protection for healthcare providers supporting spiritual emergence rather than pathologizing mystical experiences

**Clinical Decision Tree Legal Framework**:
- **Mandatory Training**: All mental health professionals required to complete consciousness-inclusive assessment training
- **Second Opinion Requirements**: Spiritual experiences require consultation with traditional healers or spiritual emergency specialists before psychiatric intervention
- **Community Advocate Rights**: Individuals experiencing spiritual crisis have right to cultural and spiritual advocates in any legal proceedings

### Neurodiversity Affirmation Legislation

**Legal recognition of cognitive and emotional diversity as natural human variation**

Moving beyond anti-discrimination to active affirmation, this framework establishes legal protections for neurodivergent individuals while eliminating pathologizing language and practices from mental health law.

**Neurodiversity Rights Protection**:
- **Cognitive Liberty**: Legal right to cognitive and emotional diversity without forced normalization
