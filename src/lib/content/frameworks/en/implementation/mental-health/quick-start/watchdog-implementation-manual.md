# Mental Health Watchdog Implementation Manual
## Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health

> *"Independent oversight with community authority - accountability that serves healing rather than bureaucracy."*



## Overview

The Global Mental Health Watchdog represents an independent oversight system that monitors mental health rights compliance, documents violations, and enforces accountability through a community-controlled Traffic Light System. Unlike traditional institutional monitoring, this watchdog prioritizes community voices, lived experience expertise, and cultural sovereignty in mental health accountability.

**Core Mission**: Transform mental health accountability from institutional compliance reporting to community-empowered oversight that serves healing and liberation rather than bureaucratic control.

### **Local Adaptation Note** ‚ö†Ô∏è
While grounded in research and international best practices, watchdog implementation should involve consultation with mental health advocates, traditional healers, and community leaders familiar with specific cultural, legal, and political contexts. Each regional implementation will be unique and should honor local wisdom and advocacy strategies.

**Remember: The watchdog exists to serve community healing and liberation, not institutional compliance. Its authority comes from community trust and traditional wisdom, not governmental or institutional recognition. Start with community needs, build with community wisdom, and measure success through community-defined flourishing.**

**Accountability that serves healing transforms systems from within while building community power for ongoing transformation. The watchdog is a tool for community empowerment, not external control.**
