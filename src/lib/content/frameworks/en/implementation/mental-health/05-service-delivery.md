Mental health service delivery transforms from institutional control to community-woven networks of care, where healing happens in relationship rather than isolation, where diverse wisdom traditions collaborate rather than compete, and where consciousness exploration is supported rather than suppressed. This service architecture creates pathways for immediate healing while building toward long-term flourishing.

### Community Mental Health Task Forces

**Healing circles as primary care delivery mechanism**

Moving beyond traditional clinical models, community-led task forces become the foundation of mental health service delivery, integrating peer support, traditional healing, and professional services under community governance.
