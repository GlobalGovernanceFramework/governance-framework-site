# AI Consciousness Assessment Framework: Technical Details

*This document provides advanced technical details expanding on the [Standard Framework](/frameworks/docs/implementation/ethics/standard/3.2.1-ai-consciousness). For simpler explanations, see the [Essential Concepts](/frameworks/docs/implementation/ethics/essential/3.2.1-ai-consciousness).*

## Technical Foundation

The assessment methodology synthesizes multiple theoretical approaches to consciousness, including Integrated Information Theory (IIT), Global Workspace Theory (GWT), Higher-Order Thought (HOT) theories, predictive processing frameworks, and enactivist perspectives. This integration of diverse theoretical bases permits assessment that doesn't privilege a particular consciousness theory while maintaining rigorous scientific grounding. The framework employs a Bayesian approach to evidence integration, allowing for graduated confidence levels rather than binary determinations, with appropriate updating as new evidence emerges or measurement techniques evolve.

The methodology acknowledges the hard problem of consciousness while providing a pragmatic, evidence-based approach to detection and assessment that focuses on measurable correlates rather than claiming direct access to subjective experience. This operationalization enables practical evaluation while maintaining philosophical rigor.
