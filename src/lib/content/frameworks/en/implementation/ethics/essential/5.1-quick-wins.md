# Quick Wins (2026–2027): Essential Concepts

## What is this about?
This explains specific, achievable goals the framework aims to accomplish in the next few years to demonstrate that expanding rights to all beings is practical and beneficial.

## Why does this matter?
Big changes happen through many small steps. By achieving visible successes quickly, we can build momentum, demonstrate that the framework works, and reduce opposition from people who are skeptical about change.

## The main idea in simple terms
Instead of trying to change everything at once, the framework focuses on specific, achievable goals that will show concrete progress and build support for broader changes over time.

## Immediate priority goals (2026-2027)

### End harmful testing on intelligent animals
**Goal**: Stop using primates (monkeys, apes) in research that causes them suffering
**Why this matters**: Primates are highly intelligent and emotional beings who suffer significantly in research settings
**How it works**:
- Global agreement to ban painful or invasive primate research
- Support for developing alternative testing methods that don't use animals
- Transition funding to help researchers adopt new approaches
- Protection for research primates, moving them to appropriate sanctuaries

**Why this is achievable**: Many countries are already moving in this direction, alternative methods are becoming available, and public support is strong.

### Create the first legally recognized river guardian
**Goal**: Establish legal representation for a major river system
**Why this matters**: Shows that ecosystems can have legal rights and effective protection
**How it works**:
- Choose a river system where there's community support for protection
- Create legal framework recognizing the river as having rights
- Establish a guardianship council with diverse representation
- Give guardians real authority to protect the river's interests
- Create funding for ongoing river protection and restoration

**Why this is achievable**: New Zealand and other countries have already done this successfully, providing a proven model.

### Develop standard AI ethics review process
**Goal**: Create agreed-upon methods for evaluating whether AI systems are ethical
**Why this matters**: AI is advancing rapidly, and we need systematic ways to ensure it serves all beings
**How it works**:
- Develop clear criteria for evaluating AI systems
- Create assessment tools that different organizations can use
- Focus first on AI systems that have major impacts on people's lives
- Establish review processes before AI systems are widely deployed
- Include diverse perspectives in AI evaluation, not just technology experts

**Why this is achievable**: There's growing recognition that AI needs ethical oversight, and many organizations want clear guidelines.

### Protect Indigenous knowledge systems
**Goal**: Create secure, Indigenous-controlled databases for traditional knowledge about nature and relationships with other beings
**Why this matters**: Indigenous communities have invaluable knowledge about living sustainably with other beings
**How it works**:
- Work with Indigenous communities to identify knowledge they want to preserve and share
- Create digital and physical storage systems controlled by Indigenous communities
- Establish protocols for who can access knowledge and how it can be used
- Ensure Indigenous communities benefit when their knowledge helps others
- Protect sacred or sensitive knowledge from inappropriate use

**Why this is achievable**: Many Indigenous communities want to preserve their knowledge, and technology exists to create secure storage systems.

### Create digital rights certification for companies
**Goal**: Voluntary standards that show companies are developing technology ethically
**Why this matters**: Gives consumers and investors ways to support ethical technology development
**How it works**:
- Develop clear standards for ethical technology practices
- Create certification process for companies that meet standards
- Include criteria for protecting privacy, preventing bias, and considering impacts on all beings
- Provide marketing and business benefits for certified companies
- Create incentives for companies to improve their practices

**Why this is achievable**: Many companies want to demonstrate ethical practices, and certification programs exist in other areas.

## Building support and reducing resistance

### Address economic concerns
**Economic impact studies**: Research and prizes for demonstrating the economic benefits of framework implementation
**Small business support**: Grants and assistance for smaller companies to adopt ethical practices
**Job transition help**: Support for workers whose jobs change as industries become more ethical

### Work with different value systems
**Religious leader engagement**: Conversations with faith leaders about how the framework aligns with spiritual values
**Traditional practice protection**: Ensuring that cultural and agricultural traditions can continue within the framework
**National sovereignty respect**: Showing how countries can implement the framework while maintaining independence

### Industry partnerships
**Technology company alliances**: Working with forward-thinking tech companies to develop ethical AI
**Extractive industry transition**: Partnerships with mining, logging, and other industries to develop sustainable practices
**Agricultural heritage programs**: Supporting farmers and ranchers in maintaining traditional practices while improving animal welfare

### Demonstration projects
**Success showcases**: High-profile examples of how traditional knowledge enhances rather than conflicts with modern practices
**Value alignment initiatives**: Showing how ethical practices serve business and community interests
**Sovereignty-affirming models**: Examples of framework implementation that strengthens rather than weakens local control

## Why these goals were chosen
