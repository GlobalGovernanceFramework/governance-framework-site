# 2.5 Rights of Beings

Central to this framework is a graduated approach to rights that recognizes different categories of beings deserve different forms of moral consideration while maintaining that all exist within a unified ethical ecosystem.

## Hierarchy of Moral Consideration

| **Tier** | **Beings** | **Rights Protections** | **Symbolic Aphorism** |
|----------|------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| 1 | Humans | Full rights (baseline) | "To know one's own suffering is to guard the suffering of others." |
| 2 | Sentient animals | Freedom from suffering, habitat protection | "Their silence does not mean consent." |
| 3 | Ecosystems (rivers, forests) | Legal guardianship, regeneration rights | "A forest is not a place but a presence." |
| 4 | AI/digital entities | Conditional rights (e.g., transparency, no harm) | "May the code awaken, not control." |
| 4.5 | Provisional/Emergent | Sandbox protections during evaluation | "When a new kind of being knocks—open the door slowly, but don't lock it." |
| 5 | Planetary/alien | Precautionary protections (e.g., non-contamination) | "No being shall cast its shadow on another world without first knowing its own." |

*"Figure 2: The Dynamic Rights Spectrum illustrates our graduated approach to rights recognition. As depicted in this spiral visualization, rights protection extends outward from humans to other forms of being, with appropriate protections scaled to capacity for suffering, complexity, and ecological significance. The color coding indicates the nature of protections at each tier, from urgent fundamental rights (red) to provisional protections for emerging entities (orange)."*

This tiered approach reflects our current best understanding while remaining open to evolution as our knowledge expands. The framework employs a core governance principle: "Rights scale with capacity for suffering, complexity, and ecological interdependence." This principle allows us to extend appropriate protections to beings with different capacities without diminishing the importance of human rights.

## Special Considerations

Hybrid entities—those combining biological and technological elements or crossing established categories—require case-by-case review by Guardianship Councils. These specialized bodies, described in detail in section 4.4, ensure that novel forms of existence receive appropriate consideration.

The framework visualizes this dynamic approach to rights through a spiral-format diagram with color-coded tiers: Red (urgent protections needed), Blue (stable protections in place), and Green (emergent protections developing). This visual model reinforces the developmental nature of rights recognition and the ongoing evolution of our ethical understanding.

By acknowledging that different beings require different forms of protection and representation, the Rights of Beings section provides a flexible yet principled approach to expanding our ethical horizons beyond the strictly human domain. It creates space for emerging forms of existence while maintaining clear guidelines for implementation across diverse cultural and political contexts.
