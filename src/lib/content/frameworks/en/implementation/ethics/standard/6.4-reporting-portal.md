## 6.4 Appendix D: Citizen Reporting Portal Template

The Citizen Reporting Portal provides an accessible, secure platform for individuals and communities to report potential rights violations and implementation challenges. This template outlines the essential components for developing effective reporting systems adaptable to various contexts and user needs.

### Accessible Submission Forms

- **Multi-modal Input Options:**
- Text-based reporting with simplified fields
- Voice recording submission for oral cultures or literacy barriers
- Image and video upload capabilities for visual documentation
- Sketch/drawing tools for situations where photos are not possible
- In-person reporting options with digital transcription

- **Accessibility Features:**
- Screen reader compatibility with WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- High contrast modes and adjustable text sizing
- Simplified language options (maximum 6th-grade reading level)
- Step-by-step guided reporting with clear instructions
- Progress saving functionality for intermittent connectivity

- **Language Inclusion:**
- Translation in 30+ languages with cultural adaptation
- Indigenous language support for regional implementation
- Pictogram-based reporting for universal understanding
- Automatic language detection based on user settings
- Cultural mediator support for translation challenges

### Case Tagging System

- **Rights Category Classification:**
- Human rights (civil, political, economic, social, cultural)
- Animal rights (welfare, habitat, species-specific protections)
- Ecosystem rights (rivers, forests, mountains, specific protected areas)
- Digital/AI rights (algorithmic transparency, data protection)
- Emerging rights (celestial bodies, future generations)

- **Violation Type Taxonomy:**
- Direct harm (physical damage, destruction, suffering)
- Indirect harm (pollution, degradation, systemic impacts)
- Procedural violations (lack of consultation, transparency failures)
- Guardianship failures (negligence, conflicts of interest)
- Implementation gaps (resource inadequacy, governance failures)

- **Severity Assessment:**
- Urgency indicators for time-sensitive cases
- Impact scale estimation (individual, community, ecosystem)
- Reversibility evaluation of reported harms
- Vulnerability factors of affected rights-holders
- Pattern recognition linking to similar reports

### Mobile-First Design

- **Optimized Performance:**
- Low-bandwidth operation (under 50KB per page)
- Progressive loading of non-essential components
- Battery-efficient operation on basic devices
- Functionality across diverse device types and screen sizes
- Graceful degradation for feature phones

- **Offline Capability:**
- Report creation and editing without connectivity
- Automatic synchronization when connection restored
- Local storage with encryption for sensitive data
- Bandwidth-conscious media compression
- SMS fallback option for critical reporting

- **Field-Friendly Features:**
- Location tagging with offline maps
- Battery status warnings and power-saving mode
- Ruggedized interface for adverse conditions
- Quick-capture options for time-sensitive documentation
- Minimal-click workflows for efficiency

### Multi-Language Support

- **Translation Infrastructure:**
- Real-time machine translation with human verification
- Local dialect recognition and adaptation
- Cultural context preservation in translation
- Technical term glossaries for accurate rights terminology
- Community-verified translations improving over time

- **Visual Reporting Options:**
- Icon-based navigation transcending language barriers
- Universal visual indicators for violation categories
- Culturally adaptive imagery respecting local contexts
- Visual evidence documentation guidelines
- Graphic storyboard reporting for sequential events

### Anonymous Reporting Protections

- **Privacy Safeguards:**
- End-to-end encryption for all submissions
- Metadata scrubbing from uploaded media
- IP address masking and routing protection
- User-controlled identity disclosure options
- Secure credential management

- **Anti-Retaliation Measures:**
- Proxy submission through trusted third parties
- Collaborative reporting allowing multiple anonymous contributors
- Temporal submission delays to prevent source identification
- Secure communication channels for follow-up questions
- Risk assessment tools for potential reporters

- **Data Protection:**
- Granular consent for information sharing
- Secure data storage with strict access controls
- Retention policies limiting vulnerability exposure
- Breach notification protocols
- Right to deletion of personal identifiers

### Implementation Requirements

- **Technical Specifications:**
- Progressive web application with native app options
- Distributed server architecture for resilience
- Open-source codebase for transparency and adaptation
- Modular design for context-specific customization
- Regular security auditing and updates

- **Training Resources:**
- Administrator guides for local implementation
- User tutorials in multiple formats (video, text, audio)
- Community workshop materials for group training
- Troubleshooting documentation and support channels
- Best practices for safe and effective reporting

- **Integration Capabilities:**
- API connections to relevant governance bodies
- Secure data sharing with authorized investigators
- Integration with existing human rights monitoring systems
- Evidence preservation for legal proceedings
- Anonymous aggregate data for public transparency

This template provides a comprehensive foundation for developing culturally appropriate, technically robust reporting systems that enable meaningful participation in rights protection for all beings.
