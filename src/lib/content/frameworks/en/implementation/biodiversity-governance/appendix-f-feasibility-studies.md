**Case Study (Real)**: **Costa Rica's Payment for Ecosystem Services Evolution** (1997-2025) demonstrates 28-year feasibility of comprehensive environmental transformation. Starting with $10M budget and 10,000 hectares, the program scaled to $100M annually covering 1M hectares, increasing forest cover from 24% to 54% while maintaining democratic governance and community participation. The program's success through multiple government changes, economic crises, and international pressure provides proof-of-concept for political and economic feasibility of large-scale environmental governance transformation.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Pacific Island Climate Alliance Feasibility Assessment** (2027-2030) projected successful implementation across 12 island nations through traditional governance integration and community-controlled technology. Economic modeling showed 15:1 benefit-cost ratio through ecosystem service preservation, while political analysis identified customary marine tenure as implementation accelerator. Technical assessment confirmed mesh network feasibility with 95% coverage using solar infrastructure, while cultural evaluation verified traditional knowledge compatibility with framework principles.
