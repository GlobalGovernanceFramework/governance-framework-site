Economic security through AUBI creates the foundation for elder agency, but true dignity requires the right to meaningful occupationâ€”the opportunity to contribute skills, wisdom, and energy in ways that matter to both elders and their communities. Current systems artificially terminate elder careers through arbitrary retirement ages, perpetuate ageism in hiring and workplace culture, and waste decades of accumulated expertise. The Right to Meaningful Occupation dismantles these barriers while creating innovation ecosystems where elder wisdom drives technological development and community solutions.
