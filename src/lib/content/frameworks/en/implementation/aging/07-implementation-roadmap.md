## Framework Integration and Implementation Coherence

The implementation roadmap creates systematic political, economic, and cultural transformation enabling comprehensive aging support while maintaining elder agency throughout the process. Phased implementation builds evidence and political power gradually, while political coalition building creates the electoral influence necessary to sustain framework development across government changes.

Economic modeling provides the evidence base for political advocacy while diversified funding ensures financial sustainability. Cultural transformation changes the narrative supporting political change, while international coordination builds global cooperation and resource sharing. Together, these implementation strategies create the political, economic, and cultural conditions enabling elders to lead their own transformation while building global solidarity for aging support.
