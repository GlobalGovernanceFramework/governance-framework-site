# EGP Glossary
## *Key Terms and Concepts*

---

## Core EGP Terms

**`adopt(experiment)`**  
The third EGP system call. Communities or institutions temporarily implement proposals as time-bound experiments with built-in review periods and exit strategies.

**`propose(solution)`**  
The second EGP system call. Anyone can suggest responses to sense signals, but must include test criteria, timeline, resources needed, and automatic sunset clauses.

**`sense(issue)`**  
The first EGP system call. Any agent (human, AI, sensor, community) can flag a systemic stressor or opportunity using standardized data formats.

**Emergent Governance Protocol (EGP)**  
The Minimum Viable Grammar for governance—three universal operations that enable simple, interoperable coordination without imposing specific decision-making processes.

**Minimum Viable Grammar (MVG)**  
The philosophical foundation of EGP: providing simple, combinable elements that enable infinite governance expressions rather than trying to design perfect systems.

**Stress Packet**  
Standardized data output from `sense()` operations containing location, severity, affected parties, evidence, and urgency information in machine-readable format.

**Sunset Clause**  
Automatic expiration date built into all `propose()` and `adopt()` operations. Nothing is permanent—good ideas get renewed, bad ones die naturally.

**System Call**  
Computing term borrowed for governance: fundamental operations that any agent can invoke, similar to how computer programs make basic requests to the operating system.

## Global Governance Framework (GGF) Terms

**Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)**  
Economic framework providing basic income through Hearts (social currency) and Leaves (ecological currency), rewarding care work and environmental restoration.

**Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ)**  
Indigenous-led governance systems organized around ecosystem boundaries rather than colonial borders, implementing traditional ecological knowledge and consensus decision-making.

**Digital Justice Tribunal**  
Global judicial body established by the Treaty for Our Only Home, with authority to prosecute ecocide, digital rights violations, and other planetary-scale harms.

**Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)**  
International standard requiring Indigenous communities' agreement before any activities affecting their territories, data, or traditional knowledge.

**Global Commons Fund (GCF)**  
Funding mechanism established by the Treaty, financed through global taxes (carbon tax, financial transaction tax) to support planetary public goods and climate action.

**Hearts Currency**  
Social currency within AUBI framework that rewards care work, community building, cultural preservation, and social contributions to well-being.

**Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework**  
The ethical foundation of the GGF, centering Indigenous sovereignty, traditional ecological knowledge, and land-based governance as guides for all other frameworks.

**Leaves Currency**  
Ecological currency within AUBI framework that rewards verified ecosystem restoration, biodiversity conservation, and environmental stewardship activities.

**Love Ledger**  
Decentralized platform for logging and validating contributions of care work, ecological restoration, and community building that generates Hearts and Leaves rewards.

**Meta-Governance**  
Coordination framework enabling different governance systems to work together without imposing uniformity—"governance of governance" across domains and scales.

**Treaty for Our Only Home**  
Constitutional framework providing legal foundation, institutional reforms, and enforcement mechanisms that enable all other GGF frameworks to operate globally.

## Technical Terms

**API (Application Programming Interface)**  
Technical standard allowing different software systems to communicate and share data, adapted for governance to enable coordination between different frameworks and communities.

**Interoperability**  
Ability of different systems to work together and exchange information effectively while maintaining their unique characteristics and decision-making processes.

**JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)**  
Standard data format used for EGP operations, making governance data machine-readable and easily shareable between different platforms and systems.

**Machine-Readable Data**  
Information formatted so computers can process and analyze it automatically, enabling rapid coordination and pattern recognition across large networks.

## Governance Philosophy Terms

**Cathedral vs. Bazaar**  
Eric Raymond's distinction between top-down designed systems (cathedral) and bottom-up emergent systems (bazaar). EGP embraces the bazaar approach for operational governance.

**Polycentric Coordination**  
Governance principle where power is shared across many centers rather than concentrated in single authorities, enabling local autonomy with global coordination.

**Subsidiarity**  
Principle that decisions should be made at the most local level possible, with higher levels providing support only when local capacity is insufficient.

**Unix Philosophy**  
Software design approach emphasizing simple, modular, composable tools that "do one thing well"—the inspiration for EGP's minimal, interoperable approach to governance.

**"Worse is Better"**  
Design philosophy prioritizing simplicity and adaptability over perfection—an adaptive "good enough" solution that can be implemented now beats a perfect one that never arrives.

## Cultural and Rights Terms

**Ceremonial Governance**  
Decision-making processes that integrate ritual, spiritual practices, and traditional protocols, recognizing governance as sacred relationship rather than purely technical activity.

**Rights of Nature**  
Legal recognition that ecosystems, rivers, forests, and other natural entities have inherent rights independent of human utility, often implemented through Indigenous advocacy.

**Seven-Generation Thinking**  
Indigenous governance principle requiring all major decisions to consider impacts on the seventh generation to come (approximately 200 years), ensuring long-term sustainability.

**Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)**  
Indigenous and traditional knowledge systems about ecological relationships, sustainable practices, and land-based governance developed over millennia of direct relationship with specific places.
