True accountability in mental health transformation requires moving beyond institutional metrics to community-defined measures of flourishing, from top-down evaluation to participatory assessment, from compliance measurement to liberation tracking. This monitoring architecture ensures that mental health systems serve community healing rather than institutional preservation, with accountability flowing from grassroots wisdom to global coordination.
