### Global Mental Health Governance Council

**Strengthening WHO leadership through multi-stakeholder transformation**

The existing WHO mental health architecture requires fundamental restructuring to center community sovereignty and rights-based approaches. Rather than creating parallel systems, this framework transforms WHO's governance model from expert-driven to community-led, ensuring that global mental health policy emerges from lived experience rather than institutional expertise alone.

**Composition & Representation**:
- **50% Lived Experience Seats**: People with personal mental health experiences, including neurodivergent individuals, psychiatric survivors, and traditional healing practitioners
- **20% Community Representatives**: Rotated biennially from community-led mental health initiatives, with 50% from marginalized communities (BIPOC, LGBTQ+, disabled, economically marginalized)
- **15% Traditional Healers & Spiritual Leaders**: UNESCO-certified practitioners representing diverse healing traditions
- **10% Frontline Providers**: Community health workers, peer specialists, and culturally-responsive clinicians
- **5% Youth Delegates**: Under-30 representatives with decision-making authority, not advisory roles

**Framework Synergy Note**: This composition aligns with the Disability Freedom Framework's "Nothing About Us Without Us" principle while incorporating the Planetary Health Accord's emphasis on frontline worker representation.

**Powers & Mechanisms**:
- **Global Standards Authority**: Establish minimum standards for rights-based mental health care, with enforcement through trade incentives and development aid conditions
- **Funding Allocation**: Direct distribution of Global Mental Health Commons Fund resources based on community-led priorities and equity metrics
- **Treaty Development**: Draft and negotiate the International Mental Health Rights Treaty with binding enforcement mechanisms
- **Veto Authority**: Suspend implementation of mental health policies that violate community sovereignty or human dignity principles

### AI-Assisted Governance Infrastructure

**Technology serving community wisdom rather than replacing it**

Governance dashboards and AI tools support but never substitute community decision-making, ensuring transparency while protecting community sovereignty and cultural knowledge.

**Technical Implementation**:
- **Transparency Dashboards**: Real-time tracking of funding flows, policy implementation, and outcome metrics, co-designed with neurodivergent communities for accessibility
- **AI Ethics Integration**: All AI governance tools audited annually for bias, with community consent protocols for data usage
- **Digital Sovereignty Protocols**: Communities maintain control over their data and participation in digital systems
- **Low-Tech Alternatives**: Paper-based scorecards and community assemblies ensure participation regardless of technological access

**Interoperability Standards**: HL7 FHIR protocols enable secure data sharing while respecting indigenous data sovereignty and community consent frameworks.

### Regional Mental Health Coordination Hubs

**Bioregional adaptation with global solidarity**

Regional coordination transcends nation-state boundaries, organizing around shared ecosystems, cultural traditions, and healing practices while maintaining connection to global solidarity networks.

**Regional Hub Structure**:
- **Bioregional Councils**: Mental health governance organized around watersheds, mountain ranges, and cultural regions rather than political boundaries

### Global Youth Mental Health Parliament

**Intergenerational governance with youth leadership**

Young people, disproportionately affected by climate anxiety, social media impacts, and economic uncertainty, require meaningful decision-making authority rather than tokenistic consultation.

**Structure & Authority**:
- **50% Global South Representation**: Centering voices from communities most impacted by mental health inequities
- **Policy-Making Authority**: Direct power to propose, amend, and veto mental health policies affecting young people
- **Budget Allocation**: Control over dedicated youth mental health funding streams within the Commons Fund
- **Crisis Response Leadership**: Youth-led rapid response teams for mental health emergencies in educational and community settings

### National Mental Health Commissions

**Community sovereignty within national frameworks**

Each nation establishes Mental Health Commissions that operationalize global standards while respecting cultural sovereignty and traditional healing approaches.

**Mandatory Composition Standards**:
- **≥30% Marginalized Group Representation**: Ensuring power-sharing with communities most harmed by current systems
- **Indigenous Healing Authority**: Traditional healers hold veto power over policies affecting indigenous communities

**Annual Performance Reviews**: Community-led evaluation of Commission effectiveness using both quantitative outcomes (budget compliance, access metrics) and qualitative measures (community trust, cultural responsiveness).

### UHC Integration Implementation

**Mental health as healthcare foundation, not add-on**

Universal Health Coverage implementation centers mental health as fundamental to all healthcare rather than a specialized service, requiring systematic transformation of health system architecture.

**Path to Compliance Framework**:

**Framework Synergy Note**: These task forces align with the Disability Freedom Framework's Care Cooperatives model, creating opportunities for cross-framework collaboration and resource sharing.

### Digital Cooperatives with Community Control

**Technology sovereignty in mental health governance**

Digital platforms serve community governance while maintaining community control over data, participation, and technological choices.

**Community Trust Scoring**:
- **Peer Accountability Systems**: Community-developed metrics for evaluating the trustworthiness and effectiveness of local mental health resources
- **Transparent Feedback Mechanisms**: Open systems for community members to share experiences and guide resource allocation
- **Cultural Integrity Monitoring**: Community oversight ensuring digital systems respect cultural values and traditional practices

**Centralized Fallback Systems**: When digital cooperatives face technical challenges or community conflict, centralized support provides mediation and technical assistance without overriding community authority.

### Conflict Resolution & Mediation

**Restorative justice in mental health governance**

Mental health governance conflicts require healing-centered approaches that address root causes while maintaining community relationships.

**Community-Based Mediation Protocols**:
- **Three-Step Process**: Community dialogue → elder mediation → regional arbitration only as final resort
- **Restorative Circle Training**: Community members trained in facilitating healing-centered conflict resolution
- **Traditional Justice Integration**: Incorporating indigenous and traditional approaches to community healing and accountability

**Standardized Mediation Protocols**: While respecting cultural diversity, common frameworks ensure fair process and prevent abuse of traditional authority.

- **Community Veto Power**: Communities can reject AI recommendations and require human-led alternatives

### Data Protection & Community Consent

**Information sovereignty in mental health governance**

Mental health data requires the highest protection standards given historical abuse of psychiatric information for social control and discrimination.

**Community Consent Protocols**:
- **Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC 2.0)**: Enhanced indigenous data governance principles applied to all mental health information
- **Collective Consent Mechanisms**: Community-level agreement required for research or data sharing, not just individual consent
- **Right to Digital Forgetfulness**: Communities and individuals can require deletion of mental health information from governance systems
