In a world grappling with mental health crises, climate anxiety, and spiritual disconnection, the *Living Mandala for Planetary Mental Health* offers a transformative blueprint for global healing—positioning mental health not as individual pathology, but as a transcultural human right woven into our planetary interdependence. This framework transcends traditional healthcare models, embracing holistic care, community sovereignty, and the sacred dimensions of human consciousness as foundations for collective flourishing.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

This framework presents a revolutionary **Global Mental Health Governance System** that moves beyond treatment toward transformation. It integrates rights-based care, ecological well-being, and consciousness-inclusive healing with practical implementation mechanisms, economic frameworks, and community-led governance structures. Aligned with Universal Health Coverage goals, the Paris Agreement's mental health provisions, and emerging Rights of Consciousness legislation, it prioritizes psychosocial flourishing, cultural sovereignty, and planetary healing.

**Vision**: Transform global mental health from a medical-industrial complex to a regenerative ecosystem of care, where Traditional Healing Knowledge guides AI, community-led governance replaces institutional control, and consciousness-inclusive healing emerges as humanity's path toward collective flourishing.

**2035 Commitment**: Mental health as a transcultural human right in 195 countries, 80% reduction in involuntary psychiatric interventions, community-led care in 10,000 bioregions, and mystical experiences recognized as healing rather than pathology in clinical practice worldwide.

**Key Features**:
- **Rights-Based Mental Health Care** with sunset clauses for coercive practices and deinstitutionalization
- **Community-Led Task Forces** with Traditional Healing Knowledge integration and cultural sovereignty
- **Global Mental Health Watchdog** with Traffic Light System and transparency dashboards
- **Consciousness-Inclusive Healing** recognizing spiritual crises as non-pathological experiences
- **Psychosocial Flourishing Metrics** beyond symptom reduction to meaning, connection, and awe
- **Ecological Well-Being Integration** addressing climate grief and human-planetary interdependence
- **Global Mental Health Commons Fund** with innovative financing and digital public infrastructure
- **Youth Mental Health Parliament** with 50% Global South representation and policy-making authority

**Target Outcomes by 2030**: ≥5% of national health budgets allocated to mental health, 50% reduction in mental health stigma globally, 10,000 community-led healing networks established, and traditional healing practices integrated into 80% of national mental health systems.
