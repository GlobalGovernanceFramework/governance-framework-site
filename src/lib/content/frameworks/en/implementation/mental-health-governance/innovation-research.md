Mental health innovation must transcend Western academic paradigms to embrace diverse ways of knowing, from ancient traditional healing wisdom to cutting-edge consciousness research. This innovation architecture ensures that research serves community needs rather than academic careers, that traditional knowledge receives equal standing with contemporary science, and that breakthrough discoveries benefit all humanity rather than enriching pharmaceutical corporations.
