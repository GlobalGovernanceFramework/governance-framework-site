Economic Decision Protocols form the governance core of the Nested Sovereignty Framework, ensuring that economic integration across local, regional, and global scales is transparent, equitable, and responsive to diverse needs. These protocols define decision-making rights, conflict resolution mechanisms, and evaluation processes, embedding the principles of sovereignty, interoperability, justice, and adaptability. Co-designed with indigenous communities, women, non-binary individuals, and marginalized groups, they prioritize inclusivity, accessibility, and accountability, enabling stakeholders to navigate complex economic systems with clarity and fairness.

## <a id="mechanisms"></a>Mechanisms
Decision protocols operate across three levels to balance autonomy and coordination:
- **Local Decision-Making**:
  - **Decision Rights Matrix**: Assigns authority for local policies (e.g., currency issuance, budgeting) to communities, with 50% women/non-binary and indigenous representation.
  - **Participatory Platforms**: Tools like “DecideTogether” enable 80% community participation in budget and policy decisions, with offline options for inclusivity.
  - **Local Arbitration**: Community panels resolve disputes (e.g., currency misuse), guided by model bylaws and indigenous protocols.
- **Regional Decision-Making**:
  - **Regional Governance Councils**: Coordinate trade zones and watershed protocols, with decision rights allocated to ensure local input and indigenous leadership.
  - **Cross-Community Arbitration**: Regional panels address conflicts (e.g., trade disputes), using transparent protocols and blockchain-based records.
  - **Feedback Loops**: Platforms collect stakeholder input to refine policies, ensuring adaptability to regional needs.
- **Global Decision-Making**:
  - **Global Mediation Network**: A UN-led network (100 mediators by 2028) resolves cross-regional disputes, with escalation to the International Court of Justice (ICJ) for unresolved cases.
  - **Commons Oversight**: Global treaties assign decision rights for commons (e.g., oceans), co-governed by indigenous and marginalized representatives.
  - **Biennial Evaluations**: Global reviews assess framework performance using the Nested Economic Health Index, informing policy updates.

## <a id="power-aware-decision-governance"></a>Power-Aware Decision Governance

The framework's decision protocols must explicitly address power imbalances to prevent capture by economic interests that may undermine its transformative potential. This section outlines specific mechanisms to ensure decision governance remains aligned with framework principles despite powerful actor influence attempts.

### Power Distribution Mechanisms

Decision governance incorporates specific structures to address both formal and informal power imbalances:

1. **Representation Balancing Requirements**:
   - **Mechanism**: Decision bodies at all levels require balanced representation across axes of power:
     - Economic: Maximum 30% representation from any single economic sector
     - Gender: Minimum 50% women and non-binary individuals
     - Stakeholder: Minimum 30% from traditionally marginalized groups
     - Geographic: Representation proportional to population with rural protection provisions
   - **Enforcement**: The **Governance Audit Protocol** provides third-party verification of balance metrics.
   - **Precedent Example**: The Forest Stewardship Council's three-chamber system (economic, social, environmental) demonstrates how structural balance requirements prevent capture.

2. **Rotating Authority Mechanisms**:
   - **Mechanism**: Key decision roles rotate on staggered 2-year terms with:
     - Term limits (maximum two consecutive terms)
     - Mandatory diversity in succession
     - Transparent nomination processes
     - Supermajority (70%) approval requirements
   - **Enforcement**: The **Leadership Transition Protocol** defines processes and verification steps.
   - **Precedent Example**: Mondragón cooperatives' rotating leadership with mandatory diversity has maintained democratic function despite growth.

3. **Power-Balancing Procedures**:
   - **Mechanism**: Meeting and decision procedures incorporate specific equalizing practices:
     - Structured turn-taking requirements
     - Anonymous idea submission options
     - Deliberation formats before voting
     - Impact assessment on marginalized stakeholders
   - **Enforcement**: The **Facilitation Justice Toolkit** provides trained facilitators and assessment tools.
   - **Precedent Example**: Quaker consensus processes with structured speaking opportunities demonstrate procedural power-balancing in action.

4. **Resource Equalization**:
   - **Mechanism**: Decision participation barriers addressed through:
     - Compensated participation for low-resource stakeholders
     - Technical assistance for complex decisions
     - Scheduling accommodation for caregivers
     - Language services for multilingual participation
   - **Enforcement**: The **Participation Accessibility Fund** provides resources and verification.
   - **Precedent Example**: The participatory budgeting systems in Recife, Brazil demonstrated how resource equalization dramatically increased participation from marginalized communities.

### Capture Prevention Systems

Specific mechanisms prevent decision capture by powerful economic interests:

1. **Conflict Disclosure Requirements**:
   - **Mechanism**: Comprehensive disclosure systems for all decision participants including:
     - Direct financial interests in affected sectors (current and past 5 years)
     - Professional relationships with potentially affected entities
     - Family and social network connections to interested parties
     - Previous positions and revolving door histories
   - **Enforcement**: The **Conflict Transparency Database** provides public access to all disclosures.
   - **Precedent Example**: The International Association of Impact Assessment's enhanced disclosure protocols demonstrated how transparency reduces hidden influence.

2. **Supermajority Escalation**:
   - **Mechanism**: Decisions with identified power imbalance risks require escalating supermajorities:
     - Standard decisions: Simple majority (>50%)
     - Resource allocation decisions: Enhanced majority (>60%)
     - Structural governance changes: High supermajority (>70%)
     - Fundamental principle modifications: Near-consensus (>80%)
   - **Enforcement**: The **Decision Classification Protocol** categorizes decisions by power implications.
   - **Precedent Example**: Cooperative bylaws with escalating approval requirements for structural changes have prevented power consolidation.

3. **Sunset and Review Requirements**:
   - **Mechanism**: All significant authorities and delegations include:
     - Automatic sunset provisions (2-5 year maximum)
     - Mandatory public review processes before renewal
     - Performance evaluation against power distribution metrics
     - Public comment periods for affected communities
   - **Enforcement**: The **Authority Review Calendar** tracks and publishes upcoming reviews.
   - **Precedent Example**: The Great Lakes Compact's mandatory review periods have enabled improved indigenous representation over time.

4. **Algorithmic Power Audit**:
   - **Mechanism**: Technical systems and algorithms undergo power analysis including:
     - Disparate impact assessment across demographic groups
     - Accessibility barriers identification
     - Decision opacity evaluation
     - Benefit distribution analysis
   - **Enforcement**: The **Algorithmic Justice Tool** provides standardized audit procedures.
   - **Precedent Example**: Barcelona's Algorithmic Audit Office demonstrated how technical assessments can identify and remediate hidden power biases.

### Countering Specific Capture Tactics

Decision protocols include specific defenses against common capture mechanisms:

1. **Technical Complexity Capture**:
   - **Tactic**: Powerful actors often embed influence through technical complexity that obscures power implications
   - **Defense Mechanism**: The **Technical Translation Protocol** requires plain language summaries of all technical proposals with explicit power impact statements
   - **Implementation Tool**: The **Complexity-to-Power Mapping** exercise identifies hidden power implications
   - **Success Metric**: 80% comprehension by all stakeholders before voting

2. **Urgency Manipulation**:
   - **Tactic**: Creating artificial urgency to bypass normal deliberation and participation requirements
   - **Defense Mechanism**: The **Urgency Verification Framework** requires evidence-based assessment of true time constraints
   - **Implementation Tool**: The **Deliberation Triage Tool** distinguishes genuine emergencies from manufactured urgency
   - **Success Metric**: 90% of decisions follow full deliberation protocols

3. **Proxy Control**:
   - **Tactic**: Influencing decisions through ostensibly independent representatives with hidden connections
   - **Defense Mechanism**: The **Network Analysis Protocol** maps relationship patterns across decision bodies
   - **Implementation Tool**: The **Influence Mapping Database** tracks voting patterns and proposal origins
   - **Success Metric**: Public disclosure of all identified proxy relationships

4. **Resource Asymmetry Exploitation**:
   - **Tactic**: Using superior resources (staff, legal expertise, technical capacity) to dominate decision processes
   - **Defense Mechanism**: The **Resource Equalization Fund** provides support to under-resourced stakeholders
   - **Implementation Tool**: The **Power-Balanced Deliberation Guide** structures processes to neutralize resource advantages
   - **Success Metric**: Participation ratios across resource levels within 20% of population distribution

By implementing these power-aware governance mechanisms, the framework ensures that decision processes remain aligned with core principles despite inevitable influence attempts by established economic interests. Rather than naive proceduralism that ignores power realities, this approach builds structural safeguards that enable authentic democratic function in the context of existing power imbalances.

## <a id="monetary-policy-coordination-protocols"></a>Monetary Policy Coordination Protocols

The framework establishes clear protocols for coordination between community monetary governance and central bank policy to reduce conflicts while preserving local sovereignty:

- **Policy Monitoring Mechanism**: Currency Boards implement systematic tracking of central bank policies, with:
  - Quarterly analysis of monetary policy statements and decisions
  - Assessment of potential impacts on community currency
  - Preparation of adaptation strategies for significant policy shifts
  
  This proactive monitoring enables communities to adjust parameters before conflicts emerge.

- **Two-Way Communication Channels**: Formal structures for regular dialogue, including:
  - Standardized quarterly reports to central banks on community currency metrics
  - Notification protocols for significant parameter changes
  - Annual policy coordination meetings with central bank representatives
  - Emergency communication channels during financial instability
  
  These channels ensure both transparency and coordination without subordination.

- **Complementary Policy Framework**: Guidelines for designing community currency policies that complement rather than counteract central bank objectives:
  - Countercyclical parameters that enhance rather than undermine price stability
  - Circuit breaker mechanisms that activate during extreme monetary conditions
  - Automatic stabilizers that reduce volatility transmission
  
  This framework enables monetary diversity while acknowledging shared stability objectives.

- **Conflict Resolution Process**: When monetary policy conflicts arise, a structured resolution approach includes:
  1. Technical assessment of actual versus perceived impacts
  2. Mediated dialogue facilitated by neutral monetary experts
  3. Temporary parameter adjustments while maintaining core functions
  4. If necessary, appeal to defined legal frameworks for monetary plurality
  
  This process preserves community monetary sovereignty while providing resolution mechanisms.

- **Legal Recognition Strategy**: A pathway to formal recognition includes:
  - Draft legislation for "Complementary Currency" legal status
  - Model regulations distinguishing from both national currency and payment systems
  - Precedent documentation from supportive jurisdictions
  - Engagement with legislative committees on monetary innovation
  
  This strategy aims to secure clear legal status for community monetary sovereignty.

The Monetary Policy Coordination Protocols balance the tension between local monetary innovation and central bank mandates, creating sustainable space for community currencies within the broader monetary system. These protocols are customizable via the DecideTogether Platform to reflect local regulatory environments while maintaining framework compliance.

## <a id="monetary-policy-framework"></a>Monetary Policy Framework

The framework's monetary components operate alongside national and global financial systems through a carefully structured approach to monetary policy coordination, sovereignty balance, and macroeconomic stability:

### Monetary Governance Structure
- **Local Level**: Community Currency Boards with elected representatives manage issuance, backed by local assets (production capacity, land trusts, renewable energy) rather than solely national currency.
- **Regional Level**: Currency Network Councils coordinate exchange rates, with stabilization protocols triggered by inflation differentials between member currencies.
- **Global Level**: Monetary Advisory Network composed of economists, central bankers, and indigenous leaders develops best practices for complementary currency stability.

### Inflation Management Protocols
- **Measurement**: Community-specific inflation baskets track local prices, weighted toward essential goods (food, housing, energy) and recalculated quarterly.
- **Issuance Controls**: Algorithmic issuance tied to productive capacity and basket-of-goods indicators rather than fixed targets, with 60% weight to local production and 40% to regional trade balance.
- **Purchasing Power Protection**: Smart contracts automatically adjust currency parameters during inflationary periods, maintaining stable pricing for essential goods while allowing fluctuation in luxury sectors.

### Interest Rate and Credit Systems
- **Mutual Credit Clearinghouses**: Zero-interest mutual credit provides liquidity for business-to-business transactions, reducing dependency on interest rate sensitive capital.
- **Community Investment Pools**: Cooperative financing applies time-limited, purpose-specific investment with returns linked to project success rather than arbitrary rates.
- **Countercyclical Mechanisms**: Regional development banks increase lending capacity during national monetary tightening, funded by pre-established stability reserves.

### Exchange Rate Governance
- **Multi-tier System**: Three-level exchange system separates: (1) essential goods with stability mandates, (2) regional trade with managed flexibility, and (3) external exchange with protection mechanisms.
- **Volatility Management**: Algorithmic trading bands prevent extreme daily fluctuations while allowing gradual adjustment to fundamental changes.
- **Crisis Protocols**: Predefined emergency measures including temporary conversion limits, priority exchange for essential imports, and regional mutual support activate automatically during severe instability.

This monetary policy framework ensures framework currencies function as effective complements to national monetary systems while providing local resilience during macroeconomic instability. Governance mechanisms prioritize transparency and democratic oversight, with 80% of monetary decisions requiring community approval via DecideTogether platforms.

- **90% Dispute Resolution**: 90% of conflicts resolved within 6 months by 2035, measured through arbitration and ICJ records.
- **50% Marginalized Representation**: 50% of decision-making roles held by women, non-binary, and indigenous individuals, assessed via governance audits.
- **70% Policy Adaptability**: 70% of policies updated based on biennial evaluations, monitored through framework reports.

## <a id="currency-stability-governance"></a>Currency Stability Governance

The governance of currency volatility management requires specialized decision protocols that balance rapid response capabilities with democratic oversight:

### Decision Rights Matrix for Volatility Management

| Decision Type | Normal Conditions | Moderate Volatility | Severe Volatility |
|---------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| Daily Exchange Parameters | Algorithm-based with Currency Board oversight | Currency Board with community notification | Emergency Committee with 24-hour community review |
| Reserve Deployment | Quarterly review with 70% approval | Currency Board with 48-hour community review | Emergency Committee with post-action community review |
| Circuit Breaker Activation | Automatic based on predetermined thresholds | Currency Board can modify thresholds by 20% | Emergency Committee can implement special measures |
| External Exchange Limits | Community vote with 60% approval | Currency Board can implement temporary restrictions | Emergency Committee can suspend non-essential exchange |

### Governance Bodies

- **Currency Board**: 7-11 elected members with 50% women/non-binary and indigenous representation, serving staggered 2-year terms. Requires financial literacy training and commits to transparency protocols.

- **Emergency Committee**: 5 members including Currency Board Chair, two additional board members, and two community representatives with relevant expertise. Activated only during predefined volatility emergencies.

- **Community Assembly**: All currency users, participating via the DecideTogether Platform for major decisions and policy reviews. Holds ultimate authority to override other bodies with 70% supermajority.

### Decision Process Flow

1. **Monitoring and Detection**: Automated systems continuously monitor volatility indicators against predefined thresholds.

2. **Alert and Escalation**: Tiered alert system notifies appropriate governance bodies when thresholds are crossed:
   - Level 1 (±5% deviation): Currency Board notification only
   - Level 2 (±10% deviation): Currency Board convenes within 24 hours
   - Level 3 (±15% deviation): Emergency Committee activation

3. **Decision Implementation**: Response measures implemented through:
   - Blockchain-based execution for technical parameters
   - Community notification via multiple channels (digital, SMS, community boards)
   - Regional coordination when appropriate

4. **Review and Adaptation**: All volatility responses undergo mandatory review:
   - Minor adjustments: Monthly Currency Board review
   - Major interventions: Community Assembly review within 30 days
   - Emergency measures: Comprehensive review with external evaluation

This governance structure ensures volatility management remains accountable to community priorities while enabling swift response to protect currency stability and local economic function during turbulent conditions. The Decision Rights Matrix is customizable via the DecideTogether Platform, allowing communities to adapt governance to local conditions while maintaining framework compliance.
