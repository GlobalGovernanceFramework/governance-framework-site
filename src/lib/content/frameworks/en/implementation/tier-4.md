## Tier 4: The Visionary & Meta-Systems Layer

This highest tier contains the frameworks responsible for long-term, species-level stewardship and oversight. It includes protocols for handling existential risks (`Planetary Immune System`), governing our expansion into new domains (`Space Governance`), and cultivating the collective consciousness and wisdom (`Wisdom Governance`) needed to guide the entire GGF ecosystem into the far future.
