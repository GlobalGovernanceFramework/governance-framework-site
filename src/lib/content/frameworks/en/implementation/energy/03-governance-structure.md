# 3. Governance Structure

**In this section:**
- [Governance Design Principles](#governance-design-principles)
- [Global Oversight Body](#global-oversight-body)
- [Regional Hubs](#regional-hubs)
- [National Implementation Units](#national-implementation-units)
- [Integration with Existing International Structures](#integration-with-existing-international-structures)
- [Private Sector and Market Governance](#private-sector-and-market-governance)
- [Institutional Integrity Safeguards](#institutional-integrity-safeguards)

The Climate & Energy Governance Framework establishes a multi-level, interconnected governance architecture designed to balance global coordination with regional contexts and national sovereignty. This structure addresses key weaknesses in current climate and energy governance systems: insufficient coordination, inadequate implementation support, limited accountability mechanisms, and vulnerability to political shifts. The structure consists of three complementary levels working in concert to ensure effective, resilient, and equitable governance.

## Governance Design Principles

The framework's governance structure is built upon several core design principles:

- **Subsidiarity**: Decisions are made at the lowest effective level, with higher governance levels addressing only those issues that cannot be resolved at lower levels.

- **Polycentric Design**: Multiple, overlapping centers of decision-making create redundancy and resilience while allowing for context-specific solutions.

- **Inclusive Legitimacy**: Governance bodies derive legitimacy from both traditional state representation and meaningful inclusion of non-state actors, particularly affected communities.

- **Adaptive Learning**: Governance structures incorporate feedback mechanisms and regular review processes to evolve based on implementation experience.

- **Transparency by Design**: Information disclosure and decision transparency are built into operational procedures, not added as afterthoughts.

- **Balanced Accountability**: Governance bodies are accountable both upward to international commitments and downward to affected communities.

## <a id="global-oversight-body"></a>Global Oversight Body

At the global level, this framework establishes a Climate & Energy Governance Council that builds upon and enhances existing international mechanisms while adding crucial new capacities.

### Mandate and Functions

The Council serves as the apex coordinating body for global climate and energy governance with the following key functions:
