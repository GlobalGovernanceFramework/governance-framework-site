## Preamble

We carry the dust of our homelands on our feet and the songs of our ancestors in our hearts.  
We are the children of the first journey, the grandchildren of the great dispersal.  
Movement is our inheritance; belonging is our birthright.  
We do not cross borders; we weave threads between sacred places.  
This is our covenant: to ensure every journey is met with dignity, every arrival is an act of welcome, and every human being has a place to call home on this, our shared Earth.
