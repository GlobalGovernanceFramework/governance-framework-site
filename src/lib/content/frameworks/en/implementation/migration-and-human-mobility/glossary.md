This glossary provides essential definitions for understanding the Enhanced Global Governance Framework for Migration & Human Mobility and its integration with the Golden Triangle ecosystem. Terms are organized to support learning and implementation while respecting the cultural protocols and Traditional Knowledge that inform framework development.

## <a id="core-framework-terms"></a>Core Framework Terms

**Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)**: Indigenous-led territorial governance organized around watersheds, ecosystems, and traditional territories rather than colonial nation-state borders. BAZs operate through Traditional Knowledge, seasonal governance cycles, and Indigenous territorial sovereignty while coordinating with other bioregions through traditional confederacy and alliance protocols.

**Climate Adaptation Visas**: Support for communities choosing to remain in climate-vulnerable areas through Traditional Knowledge-guided adaptation, ecosystem restoration, and community resilience building rather than only offering relocation options. Funded through Treaty carbon tax revenue and corporate accountability for climate displacement.

**Climate Resilience Visas**: Automatic temporary relocation rights triggered by scientifically validated climate thresholds with Traditional Knowledge confirmation. Provide immediate legal status, community integration support, and Hearts currency validation for ecological and cultural contributions while maintaining cultural continuity and homeland connections.

**Enhanced Global Governance Framework for Migration & Human Mobility**: Comprehensive application layer demonstrating how the Golden Triangle frameworks (Treaty for Our Only Home, Meta-Governance, Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge, Financial Systems) work together to transform migration from crisis management into sacred circulation serving planetary healing.

**Fluid Sovereignty**: Rights and belonging based on community participation and contribution rather than fixed territorial citizenship or nation-state administrative classification. Operates through polycentric coordination recognizing diverse membership models from Indigenous kinship systems to bioregional stewardship relationships.

**Global Mobility Passport**: Blockchain-based credential recognizing contributions through Hearts currency validation while protecting Indigenous data sovereignty. Enables migration integration through community-validated care work, ecological restoration, and cultural preservation rather than narrow economic productivity or administrative approval.

**Golden Triangle**: The integrated architecture of four foundational frameworks: Treaty for Our Only Home (legal authority), Meta-Governance Framework (polycentric coordination), Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge (cultural sovereignty), and Financial Systems (sacred economics). Demonstrates that planetary governance requires comprehensive rather than fragmented transformation.

**Heritage Mobility Pathways**: Cultural continuity protection ensuring migration strengthens rather than weakens traditional knowledge transmission, language preservation, and ceremonial practice maintenance across geographic movement. Includes systematic Traditional Knowledge documentation, virtual homeland connections, and cultural ambassador programs.
