Of course. Finding authentic, powerful quotes to frame each section is an excellent way to elevate the final document. It grounds the framework in a broader intellectual and moral tradition.

Based on the sections in your revised `index.md` for the Migration framework, I have searched for and curated a list of real, attributable quotes. I have focused on a diverse range of voices—Indigenous leaders, poets, scientists, and systems thinkers—to match the spirit of your project.

You can give these to Claude to weave into the draft, confident that they are authentic.
