## Tier 3: Equity, Culture & Future Generations

This tier focuses on ensuring inclusion, preserving diverse heritages, and representing those often overlookedâ€”such as youth, Indigenous peoples, rural communities, and future generations. These frameworks ensure that the governance model reflects the full spectrum of humanity and honors our cultural and ecological legacy.
