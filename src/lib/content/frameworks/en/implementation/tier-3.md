## Tier 3: The Equity & Cultural Flourishing Layer

Once a society is stable and its core systems are healthy, this tier ensures that it is also deeply just, inclusive, and culturally vibrant. These frameworks focus on protecting the rights of specific communities (`Gender & Kinship`, `Disability Justice`, `Youth & Elders`), preserving our collective heritage, and managing our shared knowledge commons.
