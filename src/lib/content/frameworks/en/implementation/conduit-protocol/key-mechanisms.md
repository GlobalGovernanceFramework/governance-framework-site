# Key Mechanisms & Governance: From Planning to Performance

*This section details the integrated governance mechanisms that transform infrastructure from extraction to regeneration‚Äîcovering community co-design, technical standards, economic instruments, and crisis protocols that ensure infrastructure serves justice and ecological health.*

The Conduit Protocol operates through fourteen integrated mechanisms that coordinate across technical, governance, economic, and cultural dimensions. These mechanisms work together to ensure that infrastructure development serves community sovereignty, ecological regeneration, and climate resilience while preventing corporate capture and ensuring democratic accountability.

## **üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure Planning & Community Co-Design**

### **The Infrastructure Planning & Permitting Process (`process_ippp`)**
*Community-led development with justice and sustainability requirements*
