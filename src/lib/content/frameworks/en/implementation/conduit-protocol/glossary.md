*"Language shapes reality. When we speak of infrastructure as commons rather than commodity, of stewardship rather than ownership, of community sovereignty rather than corporate control, we create the conceptual foundation for the world we're building together."*

**Infrastructure as commons. Community as sovereign. Language as liberation.**
