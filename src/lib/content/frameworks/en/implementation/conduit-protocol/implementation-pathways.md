# Implementation Pathways: From Vision to Reality

*This section outlines the strategic three-phase approach that builds momentum while respecting community sovereignty—covering pilot development, regional scaling, and selective global adoption through adaptive milestone-based implementation that prioritizes willing participants while addressing resistance.*

The Conduit Protocol deploys through a **milestone-based, adaptive implementation plan** over 13-25 years that prioritizes effectiveness over rigid timelines. Rather than imposing uniform adoption, this approach builds momentum through demonstrated success, coalition building, and economic incentives while maintaining flexibility to adapt to geopolitical shifts, technological developments, and community priorities.

## **🌱 Pre-Phase Foundation (Year 0-1): Building the Foundation**
*Establishing legal frameworks, technical standards, and pilot program selection*
