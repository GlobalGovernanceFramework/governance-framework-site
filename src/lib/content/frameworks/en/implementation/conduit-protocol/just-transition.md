# Just Transition & Decommissioning: Healing the Wounds of Extraction

*This section outlines how the Conduit Protocol ensures infrastructure transformation serves justice and healing rather than perpetuating harm‚Äîthrough comprehensive worker support, community reparations, environmental restoration, and anti-displacement protections that center affected communities' voices and sovereignty.*

The transition from extractive to regenerative infrastructure must be fundamentally just, healing historical wounds while preventing new harms. The Conduit Protocol recognizes that fossil fuel infrastructure has devastated communities for generations‚Äîfrom coal mines poisoning Appalachian water sources to oil refineries creating cancer clusters in Louisiana's Cancer Alley. Black Americans are roughly 75% more likely to live in communities proximate to high-emission or toxic industrial processes, and typically endure levels of air pollution at least 56% higher than what would be equitable. This transformation must repair these injustices while supporting the workers and communities who built our energy systems.

## **üè≠ Fossil Fuel Decommissioning Trust**
*Comprehensive reparations and restoration for communities harmed by extractive infrastructure*

<details>
<summary><strong>Reparations Levy & Corporate Accountability</strong></summary>

The **Fossil Fuel Decommissioning Trust (`institution_decom_trust`)** represents a fundamental shift in who pays for infrastructure transformation. Rather than burdening communities with cleanup costs, the Trust is funded through a **Reparations Levy** on fossil fuel corporations via the **Corporate Reparations Protocol (`framework_hearthstone`)** and the **Global Commons Fund (`mechanism_gcf`)**.

**Funding Sources & Corporate Responsibility:**
- **Progressive Corporate Levy**: Tax rates based on historical extraction profits and documented environmental damage
- **Stranded Asset Assessment**: Additional charges for companies with assets requiring decommissioning
- **Pollution Damage Calculation**: Rates adjusted based on community health impacts and ecosystem destruction
- **Future Harm Prevention**: Higher rates for companies resisting transition or expanding fossil fuel operations

**Accountability Mechanisms:**
- **Community Damage Documentation**: Affected communities participate in assessing environmental and health impacts
- **Transparent Financial Tracking**: All levy calculations and Trust spending publicly documented
- **Corporate Disclosure Requirements**: Full disclosure of extraction history, environmental impacts, and transition plans
- **Enforcement Authority**: **Digital Justice Tribunal (`institution_dj_tribunal`)** can impose additional penalties for tax avoidance or false reporting

> **Justice Principle**: Those who profited from extraction must fund restoration and reparations, not the communities they harmed.
