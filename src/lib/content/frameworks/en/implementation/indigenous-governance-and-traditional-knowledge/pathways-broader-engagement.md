These pathways honor the principle that Indigenous sovereignty does not mean Indigenous isolation. While this framework is Indigenous-led and maintains Indigenous authority at every level, it creates possibilities for non-Indigenous people and organizations to support transformation while respecting Indigenous leadership and cultural protocols. These pathways emphasize relationship-building, mutual learning, and long-term commitment rather than extractive engagement or performative allyship.

Each pathway operates under the fundamental understanding that allies support Indigenous leadership rather than directing or co-opting Indigenous initiatives. Engagement requires ongoing relationship, cultural education, and accountability to Indigenous communities rather than one-time actions or symbolic gestures. The framework provides guidance for ethical support while maintaining Indigenous authority over the terms and conditions of collaboration.

### Understanding True Allyship

Non-Indigenous people living within traditional territories can support Indigenous sovereignty while addressing their own responsibilities as settlers and developing appropriate relationships with place-based Indigenous communities. This support begins with understanding that the land calls to all people, but some have forgotten their instructions while the invitation to remember remains open.

**Relationship-First Engagement**: Ways that some non-Indigenous people have learned to support Indigenous leadership:
- Land acknowledgment that moves beyond symbolic recognition to material support for land return and Indigenous sovereignty
- Traditional territory education about the history, culture, and contemporary realities of Indigenous peoples whose territory they inhabit
- Cultural protocol learning about appropriate ways to engage with Indigenous communities and governance systems
- Long-term relationship commitment to building sustained connections rather than project-based or transactional engagement

**Practical Support Activities**: Actions that some allies have taken:
- Land return campaigns supporting Indigenous land back movements through advocacy, fundraising, and volunteer labor
- Traditional knowledge learning about ecological practices appropriate for non-Indigenous people while respecting Indigenous intellectual property
- Economic support by redirecting spending to Indigenous-owned businesses and community economic development
- Political advocacy using settler privilege to advocate for Indigenous rights, treaty implementation, and government accountability

### Bioregional Restoration Support

**Ecological Restoration Under Indigenous Leadership**: Ways that some non-Indigenous people participate in healing work:
- Watershed restoration projects participating in Indigenous-led habitat restoration using traditional knowledge and ecological practices
- Traditional agriculture support learning about and supporting traditional farming practices while respecting Indigenous food sovereignty
- Species restoration assistance supporting Indigenous-led wildlife and plant restoration using traditional knowledge and contemporary conservation science
