# Pathways for Broader Engagement: Walking Together in Good Relation

> *"Stories carry the wisdom of our ancestors and the dreams of our children. When we share our stories with respect, we weave the world we want to live in."*

**Estimated Reading Time**: 24 minutes

These pathways operate within the broader [Integrated Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance), demonstrating how **pluriversal governance recognition** and **civic participation beyond representation** can be realized through Indigenous leadership while supporting coordination across diverse governance systems.

The pathways for broader engagement honor the principle that Indigenous sovereignty does not mean Indigenous isolation. While this framework is Indigenous-led and maintains Indigenous authority at every level, it creates multiple entry points for non-Indigenous people and organizations to support transformation while respecting Indigenous leadership and cultural protocols. These pathways emphasize relationship-building, mutual learning, and long-term commitment rather than extractive engagement or performative allyship.

Each pathway operates under the fundamental principle that allies support Indigenous leadership rather than directing or co-opting Indigenous initiatives. Engagement requires ongoing relationship, cultural education, and accountability to Indigenous communities rather than one-time actions or symbolic gestures. The framework provides clear guidance for ethical engagement while maintaining Indigenous authority over the terms and conditions of collaboration.

**Navigation Note**: These pathways for broader engagement provide multiple entry points for non-Indigenous people and organizations to support Indigenous-led transformation while maintaining Indigenous authority and cultural protocols. Continue to [Documentation and Risk Assessment](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#documentation-risk-assessment) to explore implementation challenges and success strategies, or access [Implementation Tools](/frameworks/tools/indigenous) for practical resources supporting ethical engagement and partnership development.

**Engagement Principles**: All broader engagement must operate under Indigenous leadership, respect cultural protocols, support Indigenous sovereignty, and commit to long-term relationship rather than extractive or transactional engagement. Allies support Indigenous initiatives rather than directing or co-opting Indigenous movements while taking responsibility for challenging colonialism within their own communities and institutions.
