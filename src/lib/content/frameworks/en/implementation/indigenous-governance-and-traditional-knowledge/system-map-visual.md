The Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework operates as a living system of interconnected relationships rather than a hierarchical structure. This system map visualizes the framework as Indigenous peoples understand systems—as webs of relationship, seasonal cycles, and flowing connections that strengthen through use and adapt through wisdom. Each component exists in relationship to all others, creating resilience through diversity and strength through unity.

This visualization honors Indigenous ways of seeing systems as circles rather than pyramids, flows rather than fixed structures, and relationships rather than isolated components. The system map demonstrates how Traditional Ecological Knowledge, bioregional governance, cultural revitalization, and technological sovereignty weave together into a coherent framework for planetary healing.

### Sacred Circle System Architecture

**Central Sacred Fire: Indigenous Sovereignty and Traditional Knowledge**
At the center of the framework sits Indigenous sovereignty and Traditional Ecological Knowledge—the sacred fire that gives life and direction to all other components. This central authority ensures that all framework elements serve Indigenous self-determination and Traditional Knowledge protection rather than external interests.

**Inner Circle: Core Governance Systems**

> *"In the traditional way, everything is connected. The health of the water depends on the health of the forest. The health of the people depends on the health of all our relations."*  
> — Anishinaabe teaching

### Traditional Knowledge → Governance Authority

**Foundation Relationship**: Traditional Ecological Knowledge provides the foundation for all governance decisions, ensuring that political authority emerges from ecological relationship and cultural wisdom rather than imposed colonial structures.

**Knowledge Flows**:
- Elder councils providing Traditional Knowledge guidance for Earth Council decisions
- Seasonal ecological observations informing bioregional governance cycles and policy priorities
- Traditional governance protocols guiding consensus decision-making and conflict resolution processes
