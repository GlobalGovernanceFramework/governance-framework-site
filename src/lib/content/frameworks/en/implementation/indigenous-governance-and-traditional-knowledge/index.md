In a world facing ecological collapse and spiritual disconnection, the *Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework* offers a radical blueprint for planetary transformation—positioning Indigenous peoples not as stakeholders to consult, but as the sovereign architects of regenerative governance systems. Rooted in decolonization, ecological regeneration, and post-human solidarity, this framework centers Indigenous sovereignty, ecological wisdom, and long-term sustainability as the foundation for planetary healing and thriving futures for all beings.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

This framework advances a revolutionary **Global Framework for Indigenous Governance & Traditional Knowledge Governance**, moving beyond reform to fundamental transformation. It integrates bioregional governance, non-human rights, and ceremonial stewardship with practical implementation mechanisms, comprehensive legal strategies, and technological sovereignty protocols. Aligned with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), the Paris Agreement, and emerging Rights of Nature legislation, it prioritizes Indigenous authority, ecological restoration, and seventh-generation accountability.

**Vision**: Transform planetary governance from extractive colonial systems to regenerative Indigenous-led stewardship, where Traditional Ecological Knowledge guides AI, bioregional autonomy replaces nation-states, and ceremonial governance emerges as humanity's path forward.

**2050 Commitment**: 80% of critical ecosystems under Indigenous-led Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs), Gross Planetary Health (GPH) replaces GDP globally, and 100 Indigenous languages revitalized through technology and cultural resurgence.

**Key Features**:
- **Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)** with Indigenous sovereignty and ecosystem-based governance
- **Earth Council (Kawsay Pacha)** providing moral authority and planetary coordination
- **Traditional Knowledge Protection** through Global Indigenous Creative Commons and data sovereignty
- **Regenerative Economics** centered on Gross Planetary Health metrics and reparations
- **Indigenous AI Governance** with Traditional Ecological Knowledge training and Indigenous oversight
- **Ceremonial Stewardship Transition** toward ritual-based governance inspired by songlines
- **Comprehensive Safeguards** including Red Lines Clause and cultural integrity protocols
- **Intergenerational Accountability** with 200+ year impact assessments and Future Generations Tribunal

**Target Outcomes by 2040**: 50% biodiversity increase in BAZs, 100 reparative agreements, $1T in ecological reparations, 50 languages revitalized, and 30% of land returned to Indigenous stewardship.

## <a id="framework-sections"></a>Framework Sections

The framework preserves its organic Indigenous-centered structure, organized into 10 transformative sections that honor traditional knowledge systems while providing practical implementation guidance:
