The structural components of Indigenous governance emerge from understanding that governance is relationship—relationship with place, with each other, with non-human beings, and with future generations. These structures honor the sacred architecture of Traditional Ecological Knowledge while providing possibilities for coordination that some communities may find helpful for planetary transformation.

Each component operates as a living system, adapting to local cultural protocols while maintaining connection to broader Indigenous solidarity networks. They are designed to serve and strengthen traditional governance systems rather than replace them, offering infrastructure for Indigenous communities to coordinate across bioregions while maintaining complete sovereignty over their own territories and cultural practices.

## <a id="earth-council"></a>Earth Council (Kawsay Pacha / Terra Sapiens)

### Purpose and Emergence

Some Indigenous communities have spoken of the need for a way to coordinate guidance on planetary decisions while honoring the diversity of Indigenous governance systems. The Earth Council represents one possible approach—a body that would serve participating communities through earned respect, traditional protocols, and consensus-based coordination rather than imposing authority from above.

This would not be a governing body but a wisdom council—offering guidance and coordination for communities that choose to participate while respecting the complete autonomy of all Indigenous cultures and governance systems.

**Possible Functions** (only for participating communities):
- Sharing wisdom on challenges affecting multiple bioregions
- Supporting traditional mediation when conflicts arise between Indigenous communities
- Developing protocols for ethical engagement with Traditional Knowledge
- Coordinating mutual aid during climate disasters or territorial threats

### Community-Determined Composition

If communities chose to form such a council, composition might emerge through traditional selection processes:

**Possible Representatives** (determined by participating communities):
- Indigenous Elders: Traditional knowledge keepers from bioregional confederations
- Indigenous Youth: Next-generation leaders representing future generations
- Ecological Observers: Those working under Indigenous research protocols
- Cultural Practitioners: Artists, storytellers, and ceremony leaders
- Land Defenders: Those protecting territories from extractive industries
- Traditional Knowledge Systems: Community-controlled information systems providing ecological data

**Selection Approaches**: 
- Bioregional nomination by Indigenous councils within each ecosystem area
- Cultural protocol consultation ensuring representation respects traditional governance
- Consensus confirmation requiring broad agreement from existing participants
- Elder council guidance ensuring cultural appropriateness

### Operational Possibilities

**Seasonal Gatherings**: Physical meetings that might rotate between bioregions, following cultural calendars:
- Ceremonial processes according to local Indigenous protocols
- Consensus-based coordination using traditional decision-making methods
- Consultation including non-human perspectives through traditional protocols
- Youth mentorship and governance experience opportunities

**Conflict Support**: Specialized approaches for supporting communities in disagreement:
- Traditional mediation protocols adapted from various Indigenous systems

- Sacred site changes requiring immediate protection measures
- Climate pattern changes activating adaptation coordination

### Living Examples and Possibilities

**Current Model**: The Sámi Parliament demonstrates Indigenous coordination across colonial borders, managing cultural affairs across Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia. Despite limitations imposed by Nordic states, it maintains cultural authority and provides a template for bioregional Indigenous coordination.

**Possible Development**: Communities might develop coordination systems where Traditional Knowledge protection and ecological restoration are managed across multiple nations. When colonial governments threaten Indigenous territories, coordinated response networks could activate mutual aid, international advocacy, and ecological restoration funding, demonstrating how Indigenous wisdom can guide planetary healing.

### Community Autonomy

**Participation Freedom**: Any Earth Council would exist only to serve participating communities:
- Complete freedom to join, modify participation, or withdraw at any time
- No authority over communities that choose not to participate
- Respect for diverse Indigenous governance systems and cultural protocols
- Support for community priorities rather than imposing external agendas
