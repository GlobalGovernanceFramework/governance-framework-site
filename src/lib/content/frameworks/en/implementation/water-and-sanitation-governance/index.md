In a world where 2 billion people lack safely managed drinking water and 3.6 billion lack safely managed sanitation, the *Global Framework for Water & Sanitation (WASH) Governance* offers a transformative blueprint for achieving universal access while healing our planet's water systems. Rooted in human rights, planetary stewardship, and Indigenous wisdom, this framework reimagines water governance as a pathway to justice, resilience, and regeneration. From sacred water ceremonies in Andean communities to cutting-edge smart water grids in urban centers, this framework bridges ancient wisdom with innovative technologies, empowering communities, governments, and organizations worldwide to co-create a future where water flows as a force for healing and justice.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

This framework represents the culmination of visionary thinking and practical implementation strategies, addressing the interconnected crises of water scarcity, climate change, and systemic inequity. It integrates human rights-based approaches with regenerative technologies, Indigenous knowledge systems with artificial intelligence, and local governance with global coordination. Aligned with SDG 6 and the broader Sustainable Development Goals, the Paris Agreement, and the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples, it prioritizes planetary healing, intergenerational justice, and blue democracy.

**Purpose**: To achieve universal access to safely managed water and sanitation by 2030 while regenerating Earth's hydrological systems, establishing water governance as a foundation for planetary health and social justice.

**Transformative Vision**: 
- Water recognized as a sacred, living entity with legal rights
- Universal access achieved through regenerative, climate-resilient infrastructure
- Indigenous and traditional knowledge systems at the heart of governance
- Communities empowered as water stewards and decision-makers
- Technology serving equity rather than extraction
- Water conflicts transformed into cooperation and healing

**Key Innovations**:
- **Hydrological Justice**: Systemic approach ensuring equitable water access and ecosystem health
- **Blue Democracy**: Participatory water governance as a fundamental political right  
- **Liquid Ethics**: Flexible, principled approaches to complex water governance realities
- **Water as Living Entity**: Legal personhood recognition following Indigenous worldviews
- **Regenerative WASH**: Infrastructure that heals rather than extracts
- **Intergenerational Governance**: Youth-Elder councils and 50-year impact assessments
- **Digital Water Commons**: AI and blockchain serving community empowerment
- **Planetary Healing**: Water governance as reconciliation with Earth's systems
