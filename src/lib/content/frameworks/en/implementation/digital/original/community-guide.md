# Community Implementation Guide: Digital Commons Framework

**Estimated Reading Time**: 10 minutes

**Purpose**: This guide empowers communities to implement the *Digital Commons Framework*, enabling equitable access to digital resources—data, software, knowledge, and infrastructure—through participatory governance. Designed for diverse groups, from rural villages to urban neighborhoods, it provides practical steps to start a Local Citizen Node, engage in governance, and access resources, with minimal technical or financial requirements. Rooted in historical commons practices (e.g., Iroquois Confederacy, medieval pastures) and aligned with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs 9, 10, 16), it ensures inclusivity, cultural respect, and sustainability, fostering local resilience and global collaboration.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The *Digital Commons Framework* reimagines digital resources as shared global commons, governed by communities through decentralized, transparent, and inclusive systems. Local Citizen Nodes are the heart of this framework, enabling communities to manage data, software, and infrastructure while contributing to global standards. This guide simplifies the process for communities, requiring only basic tools (e.g., a notebook, pen, phone) and offering support for low-resource settings. It emphasizes:

- **Equity**: 90% global access to digital resources by 2035.
- **Participation**: 50% adult governance engagement by 2035.
- **Sustainability**: 80% renewable energy for infrastructure by 2035.
- **Cultural Respect**: 100 languages and Indigenous protocols by 2035.

**Community Benefits**:
- Access to health, education, and climate data.
- Control over local data and cultural knowledge.
- Economic opportunities via open-source tools and data dividends.
- Resilience through decentralized infrastructure like mesh networks.

## <a id="why-start-a-node"></a>Why Start a Node?
Local Citizen Nodes empower communities to shape their digital future, addressing local needs while connecting globally. Benefits include:

- **Local Control**: Govern data and resources to reflect community priorities (e.g., health data for disease prevention).
- **Inclusivity**: Tools like SMS voting and paper ballots ensure everyone participates, regardless of tech access.
- **Economic Impact**: Access to open-source tools and data dividends boosts local innovation and income.
- **Cultural Preservation**: Protect and share traditional knowledge, as seen in Indigenous data protocols.
- **Global Voice**: Influence global digital policies through Regional Hubs and the Global Council.

**Challenges Addressed**:
- **Digital Divide**: 2.7 billion lack digital access; nodes bridge this with offline tools.
- **Corporate Control**: 72% of cloud infrastructure is corporate-owned; nodes decentralize access.
- **Environmental Harm**: Digital systems emit 5% of global emissions; nodes prioritize renewable energy.

## <a id="steps-to-start-a-local-citizen-node"></a>Steps to Start a Local Citizen Node
Starting a node is simple, requiring minimal resources and scalable to your community’s capacity.

1. **Gather a Core Group (1-2 weeks)**:
  - Assemble 10+ community members (diverse in age, gender, skills).
  - Discuss local digital needs (e.g., education access, health data).
  - Example: Senegal’s node started with 15 farmers and elders identifying malaria data needs.

2. **Register the Node (1 week)**:
  - Contact Regional Hub via SMS (text JOIN to 12345), email (globalgovernanceframework@gmail.com), or mail.
  - Submit a short description of your community and goals.
  - Receive a Node Starter Kit (guides, templates, contacts).

3. **Hold an Initial Meeting (1 day)**:
  - Use the Minimal-Viable Node Quickstart (Appendix F) to set priorities.
  - Assign roles (e.g., facilitator, scribe, tech liaison).
  - Example: Brazil’s node held a meeting under a banyan tree, setting open-source farming app goals.

4. **Set Up Basic Tools (1-2 weeks)**:
  - Use a notebook for a Field-Test Logbook to track decisions.
  - Access SMS Voting Template or paper ballots for governance.
  - Optional: Set up a solar-powered tablet or mesh network with Hub support.
  - Example: Rwanda’s node used a donated phone for SMS voting initially.

**Digital Presence Option**: Communities with basic internet access can establish an online presence using GitHub and AI tools, requiring only ~$15/year for domain registration. This ultra-lightweight approach (detailed in Appendix F) enables permanent documentation, transparent governance, and global visibility with minimal technical knowledge.

5. **Launch Pilot Activity (1-3 months)**:
  - Choose a quick-win project (e.g., access Knowledge Commons for education).
  - Vote on policies (66% majority, 50% quorum).
  - Document outcomes in the Logbook for Regional Hub feedback.
  - Example: Canada’s node piloted Indigenous knowledge archiving, voted via mesh network.

**Timeline**: Basic node setup takes 1 month; pilot activities start within 1-3 months.

**Requirements**:
- No technical expertise needed; basic literacy sufficient.
- Minimal costs ($0-$200 for initial setup, e.g., notebooks, phone credit).
- Support from Regional Hubs for training and tools.

## <a id="participating-in-governance"></a>Participating in Governance
Nodes govern digital resources through inclusive, transparent processes.

- **Propose Policies**:
  - Any member can suggest policies (e.g., data access rules, AI ethics).
  - Submit via SMS, paper, or digital platform.
  - Example: Bangladesh farmer proposed climate data sharing, adopted by 70% vote.

- **Vote on Decisions**:
  - Use SMS Voting Template (verification codes ensure security), paper ballots, or digital platforms.
  - Require 66% majority, 50% quorum.
  - Example: Senegal elders voted via paper ballots to prioritize health data.

- **Engage with Hubs/Council**:
  - Share proposals with Regional Hubs for regional/global alignment.
  - Elect representatives (stratified sampling) to Global Council.
  - Example: Rwanda node delegate shaped African data sovereignty standards.

- **Monitor and Audit**:
  - Review budgets and decisions via blockchain ledger (globalgovernanceframework.org).
  - Conduct quarterly community reviews; remove facilitators with 60% vote if needed.
  - Example: Brazil node audited AI model funding, ensuring transparency.

**Inclusivity Tools**:
- Offline scribes for non-literate members.
- Multilingual platforms (50 languages by 2030).
- Youth councils (16-25 years) for intergenerational input.

**Metrics**: Target 50% adult participation annually by 2035; 25% youth engagement by 2030.

## <a id="accessing-digital-resources"></a>Accessing Digital Resources
Nodes access five shared digital assets, tailored to local needs.

1. **Open Data Commons**:
  - Access health, climate, or education datasets via SMS, tablets, or offline archives.
