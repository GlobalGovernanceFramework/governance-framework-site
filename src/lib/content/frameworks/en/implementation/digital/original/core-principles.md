The Core Principles form the ethical and operational foundation of the Digital Commons Framework, guiding the governance of digital resources—data, software, knowledge, and infrastructure—as shared global commons. Rooted in historical commons practices, such as the Iroquois Confederacy’s consensus-based resource sharing and Elinor Ostrom’s design principles for collective management, these principles ensure a decentralized, equitable, and sustainable digital ecosystem. These seven principles form an interconnected system, mutually reinforcing each other to create a resilient commons. Radical Transparency enables meaningful Direct Participation, while Cultural Autonomy enhances Adaptive Evolution by incorporating diverse perspectives. When tensions arise between principles, deliberative processes guided by the Governance Structure resolve conflicts through transparent, participatory mechanisms. From Aisha in Senegal voting on data policies via SMS to Lila in Canada safeguarding Indigenous knowledge, these principles empower communities to shape a digital future that aligns with human rights, cultural diversity, and planetary well-being. The next section, Governance Structure, details how these principles are operationalized.

### <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The Core Principles articulate the values that underpin the Digital Commons Framework, ensuring it remains equitable, inclusive, and adaptive. Each principle is grounded in historical commons governance and translates into practical mechanisms, from blockchain-based transparency to SMS voting for participation. They are designed to balance local autonomy with global collaboration, resolve tensions through deliberation, and uphold ethical boundaries aligned with universal human rights. Success is measured through specific metrics, such as 50% adult participation in governance by 2035 and 80% renewable energy use by 2035, ensuring accountability and impact.

### <a id="decentralized-authority"></a>Decentralized Authority
Digital resources are managed by distributed networks of stakeholders, preventing control by any single entity. Inspired by medieval European commons, where villages collectively governed pastures, this principle ensures no corporation or government dominates the digital commons. While emphasizing local governance, this principle acknowledges the need for coordination on issues with global impacts. When a Local Citizen Node’s decisions might affect broader commons, Regional Hubs facilitate cross-node deliberation, ensuring autonomy is balanced with collective responsibility. Local Citizen Nodes, like one in rural Rwanda, propose and vote on policies, while Regional Digital Hubs and the Global Digital Commons Council coordinate without centralizing power. Tools like blockchain and federated learning enable secure, decentralized decision-making, ensuring governance remains community-driven and resilient to monopolistic pressures. Success is measured by the percentage of nodes operating autonomously (target: 80% by 2035).

### <a id="radical-transparency"></a>Radical Transparency
All decisions, data flows, and resource allocations are publicly auditable, fostering trust and accountability. Drawing on Elinor Ostrom’s principle of transparent monitoring, the framework uses blockchain ledgers or secure multi-party computation to make governance processes visible. For example, a Brazilian node led by Carlos, a retired programmer, can verify how automation tax funds are allocated globally, ensuring fairness. Transparency extends to AI models, with open training data and auditable algorithms, preventing hidden biases and enabling communities to scrutinize and improve digital systems. Success is measured by public audit participation rates (target: 25% of node members annually by 2035).

### <a id="direct-participation"></a>Direct Participation
Citizens, developers, and communities have a direct voice in shaping the digital commons through inclusive mechanisms like liquid democracy and citizen assemblies. In Bangladesh, an elderly farmer like Fatima participates via paper ballots, while urban youth in Singapore use digital platforms, ensuring accessibility across contexts. Modeled on historical Athenian assemblies and modern platforms like vTaiwan’s Pol.is, this principle empowers diverse stakeholders to propose, deliberate, and vote on policies, with tools like SMS voting and offline scribes ensuring no one is excluded from governance. Success is measured by participation rates (target: 50% of adults engaged in governance annually by 2035).

### <a id="resource-justice"></a>Resource Justice
Digital resources are treated as a global commons, accessible to all without exclusion, with benefits equitably shared. Inspired by Indigenous resource-sharing practices, such as the Iroquois Confederacy’s collective stewardship, this principle ensures that digital wealth—generated from data, software, or AI—benefits communities through mechanisms like data dividends. For instance, a Mexican artist like Javier accesses the Knowledge Commons for free, while profits from automation taxes fund local nodes, reducing digital inequality and aligning with the Global Governance Framework’s vision of economic equity. Success is measured by reduced digital wealth concentration (target: top 1% control less than 20% of digital assets by 2040).

### <a id="environmental-stewardship"></a>Environmental Stewardship
Digital infrastructure prioritizes energy efficiency, e-waste reduction, and alignment with planetary boundaries to minimize environmental harm. Reflecting Indigenous land management practices that balance human and ecological needs, this principle mandates renewable energy for server farms and recycling programs for hardware. A pilot in Norway integrates climate data into the Open Data Commons to enhance environmental monitoring, supporting cross-commons efforts to combat climate change. When tensions arise, such as a node’s infrastructure choices impacting global sustainability, Regional Hubs mediate to align local decisions with planetary goals. Success is measured by renewable energy use (target: 80% for digital infrastructure by 2035).

### <a id="cultural-autonomy"></a>Cultural Autonomy
Local communities adapt the digital commons to their cultural and linguistic contexts, preserving diversity and honoring global pluralism. Drawing on Ubuntu’s philosophy of collective well-being, this principle ensures that nodes, like one in Canada led by Lila, implement Indigenous data protocols to protect sacred knowledge. Multilingual platforms and culturally sensitive training enable regions to tailor governance, from Arabic interfaces in Morocco to Quechua resources in Peru. This autonomy exists within the framework of universal human rights and digital ethics, ensuring cultural expression enhances rather than undermines the commons’ core values. Success is measured by cultural diversity indicators (e.g., 100 languages supported by 2035) and global collaboration metrics (e.g., 90% of nodes engage in cross-regional projects by 2035).

### <a id="adaptive-evolution"></a>Adaptive Evolution
The digital commons evolves through citizen-driven feedback, experimentation, and iterative learning to remain relevant amid technological and societal shifts. Inspired by Ostrom’s principle of nested governance, policy updates are proposed by Local Citizen Nodes, vetted by Regional Digital Hubs, and ratified by the Global Digital Commons Council with 66% consensus. For example, a node in Singapore tests quantum encryption for voting, sharing results globally to refine the framework. This principle is measured through process indicators (e.g., 80% of nodes participating in annual reviews by 2035) and outcome metrics (e.g., average time to implement changes in response to emerging technologies: 12 months by 2035), ensuring the commons remains dynamic while maintaining its core values.
