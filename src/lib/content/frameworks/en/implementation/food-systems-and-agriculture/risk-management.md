The *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework* operates in a complex global environment, facing risks such as climate change, geopolitical tensions, and technological vulnerabilities. The Risk Management section identifies these challenges and provides proactive mitigation strategies to ensure the framework's resilience and success. By addressing potential obstacles, stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, youth, policymakers, and private sectors—can implement the framework's [Strategic Objectives](/frameworks/food-systems-and-agriculture#strategic-objectives) with confidence. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) and the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Voluntary Guidelines, this section strengthens the framework's ability to deliver equitable and sustainable food systems by 2035.

## <a id="anticipated-challenges"></a>Anticipated Challenges
**Objective**: Identify potential risks that could hinder framework implementation.

**Key Risks**:
- **Resistance from Agribusiness**: Large-scale agribusinesses may oppose transitions to regenerative practices due to short-term profit concerns.
- **Policy Misalignment**: Inconsistent national policies may fragment global efforts for sustainable food systems.
- **Geopolitical Tensions**: Trade disputes or conflicts could disrupt food supply chains and aid flows.
- **Supply Chain Disruptions**: Climate events (e.g., floods) or conflicts may interrupt food distribution.
- **Cyber Vulnerabilities**: Digital agriculture systems (e.g., artificial intelligence [AI], blockchain) face risks of hacking or data breaches.
- **Rapid Climate Changes**: Accelerated desertification or extreme weather could outpace adaptation efforts.
- **Tech Dependency**: Over-reliance on key nations or companies for technologies (e.g., AI, blockchain) may create vulnerabilities.
- **Surveillance/Data Misuse**: AI and blockchain systems could lead to privacy violations or data monopolies if not properly managed.

*Accessible explanation*: These are problems like big companies resisting change, wars disrupting food, or technology being hacked that could slow down the plan.

**Alignment**: Addresses SDG 13 (Climate Action) and SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).

## <a id="risk-priority-matrix"></a>Risk Priority Matrix
**Objective**: Prioritize risks for focused mitigation efforts.

**High Impact, High Likelihood**:
- Climate change acceleration (priority mitigation)
- Supply chain disruptions
- Geopolitical tensions affecting trade

**High Impact, Low Likelihood**:
- Cyber attacks on food systems
- Tech provider monopolization
- Pandemic-related disruptions

**Medium Impact, High Likelihood**:
- Agribusiness resistance
- Policy misalignment between nations
- Regional digital divides

**Low Impact, Variable Likelihood**:
- Temporary trade barriers
- Technology platform changes
- Minor regulatory adjustments

*Accessible explanation*: This shows which problems are most serious and likely, so we know what to fix first.

**Strategic Focus**: Prioritize resources for high-impact risks while maintaining adaptive capacity for all contingencies.

## <a id="mitigation-strategies"></a>Mitigation Strategies
**Objective**: Implement proactive measures to address risks and ensure resilience.

**Strategies**:
- **Build Coalitions for Agribusiness**: Offer tax breaks and co-investment models to align agribusiness incentives with sustainability, targeting 100 partnerships by 2028.
- **Engage in Policy Advocacy**: Facilitate policy harmonization workshops to align national policies, aiming for 50 countries adopting model legislation by 2028.
- **Establish Regional Trade Buffers**: Create regional trade networks to mitigate geopolitical risks, targeting 30% local sourcing by 2030.
- **Diversify Supply Chains**: Develop decentralized food hubs to reduce reliance on global supply chains, with 100 hubs operational by 2030.
- **Implement Cybersecurity Protocols**: Enforce data privacy frameworks and annual audits for digital platforms (e.g., AI, blockchain) to prevent breaches and misuse.
- **Develop Contingency Plans for Climate**: Create emergency seed banks and mobile farming units to address rapid climate shifts, targeting 1,000 units by 2030.
- **Mitigate Tech Dependency**: Prioritize open-source technologies and establish 10 regional tech hubs by 2030 to reduce reliance on single providers.
- **Pilot Scalable Projects**: Launch 50 pilot projects by 2027 to test solutions (e.g., drought-resistant crops, community gardens) and demonstrate viability to stakeholders.

*Accessible explanation*: Take steps like working with companies, protecting technology, and testing solutions to keep the plan strong against problems.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger), SDG 15 (Life on Land), and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

## <a id="cost-benefit-considerations"></a>Cost-Benefit Considerations
**Objective**: Evaluate the financial implications of risk mitigation versus inaction.

**Investment vs. Impact Analysis**:
- **Climate adaptation**: $10B investment prevents $100B in agricultural losses by 2035
- **Cyber security**: $500M annual spending protects $50B food system integrity
- **Regional hubs**: $2B creates $20B in resilient local economies
- **Policy alignment**: $100M coordination prevents $10B in trade barrier losses

*Key Insight*: Every $1 invested in prevention saves $10-15 in crisis response.

*Accessible explanation*: Spending money now to prevent problems is much cheaper than fixing them later.

## <a id="case-studies"></a>Case Studies
**Successful Risk Mitigation Examples**:

- **Kenya's Kilimo Salama**: Insured 185,000 farmers against climate risks, a model for scaling crop insurance to mitigate climate and supply chain disruptions.

- **India's Digital Agriculture Resilience**: IFFCO's drone delivery system maintained fertilizer supply to 1M farmers during COVID-19 lockdowns, demonstrating tech resilience.

- **Rwanda's Seed Security**: National seed reserve system protected 500,000 farmers from crop failure during 2022 drought, showing emergency preparedness effectiveness.

- **Colombia's Conflict Zones**: Mobile agricultural schools helped 50,000 displaced farmers maintain production, proving adaptability in geopolitical crises.

*Accessible explanation*: Real stories from different countries show how planning ahead helps farmers keep growing food during tough times.
