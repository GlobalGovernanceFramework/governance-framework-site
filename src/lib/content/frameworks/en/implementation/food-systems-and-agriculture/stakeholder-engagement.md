The *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework* thrives on inclusive collaboration, bringing together diverse stakeholders to transform global food systems. From smallholder farmers in Mali to policymakers in global capitals, this section outlines how governments, indigenous communities, youth movements, and private sectors co-create a resilient, equitable, and sustainable future. By prioritizing co-governance, tailored engagement, and transparent conflict resolution, the framework ensures all voices—especially marginalized ones—shape its implementation, aligning with the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP) and Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).

## <a id="key-actors"></a>Key Actors
Stakeholders critical to the framework's success include:
- **Governments**: National and local authorities shaping agricultural policies and subsidies.
- **Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs)**: Entities like Oxfam and Digital Green supporting sustainable practices and advocacy.
- **Farmers' Associations**: Groups representing smallholder and large-scale farmers, driving grassroots adoption.
- **Agribusinesses**: Companies investing in sustainable supply chains and innovation.
- **Indigenous Communities**: Custodians of Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), leading co-governance efforts.
- **Consumer Groups**: Advocates for fair trade and nutritious food access.
- **Youth Organizations and Movements**: Climate activists and young farmers spearheading innovation and advocacy.
- **Refugee Farming Communities**: Co-designing resilient farming models in camps and host areas.
- **Private Sector**: Technology firms (e.g., for AI solutions) and food retailers supporting equitable markets.

*Accessible explanation*: These are the people and groups—farmers, governments, youth, and businesses—working together to make food systems fair and sustainable.

## <a id="engagement-strategies"></a>Engagement Strategies
Methods to foster inclusive collaboration:
- **Multi-Stakeholder Dialogues**: Regional workshops to align priorities, targeting 100 events annually by 2027.
- **Inclusive Representation**: Ensuring marginalized groups (e.g., smallholder farmers, women, youth, indigenous communities, refugees) have decision-making roles, with at least 50% representation in governance bodies.
- **Youth-Led Advocacy**: Youth movements lead campaigns and innovation challenges, engaging 10,000 young advocates by 2026.
- **Refugee Integration**: Co-design workshops with refugee communities to develop farming solutions, targeting 1,000 participants by 2028.
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms and open-source repositories to disseminate TEK and best practices.

*Accessible explanation*: Bringing everyone together through meetings, fair representation, and sharing knowledge to make decisions.

## <a id="governance-structure"></a>Governance Structure
Framework for collaborative decision-making:
- **Steering Committee**: A diverse body with representatives from all key actor groups, including co-governance roles for indigenous communities to embed TEK and cultural perspectives.
- **Working Groups**: Specialized teams addressing specific issues (e.g., policy reform, innovation, equity), with 10 groups operational by 2025.
- **Example**: The United Nations (UN) Food Systems Summit's dialogues, which integrated 1,500+ actors across 148 countries, serve as a model for inclusive governance.
- **Youth and Refugee Roles**: Dedicated subcommittees for youth movements and refugee communities to ensure their priorities shape outcomes.

*Accessible explanation*: A leadership team and smaller groups, including indigenous and youth voices, guide the framework's work.

## <a id="conflict-resolution"></a>Conflict Resolution
Mechanisms to address disputes:
- **Tailored Mediation Panels**: Neutral facilitators, trained in Consensus Building Institute protocols, resolve conflicts (e.g., agribusiness vs. small farmers, indigenous groups vs. governments), with 20 panels established by 2026.
- **Participatory Decision-Making**: Protocols ensure equitable input, particularly for youth, indigenous, and refugee stakeholders, with decisions requiring 75% consensus.
- **Transparency**: Public reporting of mediation outcomes via biannual dashboards to build trust.

*Accessible explanation*: Fair processes to solve disagreements, ensuring everyone's voice is heard and solutions are open.

## <a id="partner-matrix"></a>Partner Matrix
Suggested lead organizations to drive strategic objectives:

| Objective | Suggested Lead Organizations |
|-----------|-----------------------------|
| Enhance Food Security | Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), World Food Programme (WFP), International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) |
| Promote Sustainable Practices | Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa (AGRA), Bioversity International, Indigenous Terra Madre Network |
| Foster Innovation | CGIAR, Digital Green, Microsoft (for AI), Ethereum Foundation (for blockchain) |
| Ensure Equitable Trade | Fairtrade International, World Trade Organization (WTO), Oxfam |

*Accessible explanation*: A table showing which trusted groups lead each goal, like improving food access or fair trade.

## <a id="power-dynamics--equity"></a>Power Dynamics & Equity
Strategies to address power imbalances:
- **Power Mapping Workshops**: Quarterly sessions to assess power dynamics between stakeholders, identifying where corporations might overshadow smallholder voices.
- **Resource Redistribution**: 30% of governance meeting budgets allocated to supporting participation by marginalized stakeholders (travel, translation, childcare).
- **Veto Protection**: Any stakeholder group representing >100,000 beneficiaries can trigger review of decisions affecting their community.
- **Corporate Accountability**: Agribusinesses must demonstrate community benefit sharing in any public-private partnership.
- **Voice Amplification**: Rotating leadership roles ensure diverse perspectives lead negotiations and planning sessions.

*Accessible explanation*: Fair rules to ensure small farmers have equal say as big companies, with resources to participate fully.
