The *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework* leverages communication and advocacy to inspire global action, amplify its vision, and mobilize stakeholdersâ€”farmers, indigenous communities, youth, policymakers, and private sectors. By sharing compelling narratives, using multilingual platforms, and targeting key global forums, this section ensures the framework's goals of resilient, equitable, and sustainable food systems resonate widely. Aligned with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), and the Food and Agriculture Organization's (FAO) Voluntary Guidelines, these strategies foster engagement and drive adoption, building momentum toward 2035.

## <a id="outreach-plan"></a>Outreach Plan
**Objective**: Increase visibility and engagement through diverse communication channels.

**Strategies**:
- Leverage the globalgovernanceframework.org platform to host framework materials, case studies, and interactive tools, targeting 1 million online engagements by 2027.
- Use social media campaigns, policy briefs, and webinars to reach diverse audiences, including farmers, youth, and policymakers, in multiple languages (e.g., English, Spanish, Swahili).
- Develop podcast channels to share stories of sustainable farming, aiming for 500,000 listeners by 2028.
- *Stretch Goal*: Create visual storytelling formats, such as comics depicting farmers' journeys, data-poems on biodiversity gains, and infographics on hunger reduction, targeting 100,000 views by 2029.

**Example**:
- A social media campaign featuring short videos of indigenous farmers using Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) to restore soil health, shared in 10 languages to reach global audiences.

*Accessible explanation*: Share the plan through websites, social media, podcasts, and visuals to get people excited and involved.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals).

## <a id="advocacy-goals"></a>Advocacy Goals
**Objective**: Influence global and national agendas to secure framework adoption.

**Strategies**:
- Influence key forums, including the UN Food Systems Summit, Conference of the Parties (COP), Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD), and UN Right to Food agendas, by presenting framework outcomes at 5 major events annually.
- Mobilize 10,000 grassroots supporters (e.g., farmers' associations, youth movements) to advocate for framework adoption by 2026 through regional workshops and online petitions.
- Partner with organizations like Fairtrade International and the World Food Programme (WFP) to advocate for policy reforms, such as subsidy redirection and fair trade certification.

**Feedback Mechanism**: Establish annual stakeholder surveys and social listening tools to track public reception (targeting 5,000 responses by 2027) and refine advocacy messages based on sentiment analysis and engagement metrics.

**Example**:
- A youth-led petition at the UN Food Systems Summit calling for 40% of agricultural subsidies to support regenerative practices, gaining 5,000 signatures by 2026.

*Accessible explanation*: Push for the plan at big global meetings and get thousands of people to support it with petitions and partnerships.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 2 (Zero Hunger) and SDG 13 (Climate Action).

## <a id="storytelling"></a>Storytelling
**Objective**: Use narratives to humanize the framework and inspire action.

**Strategies**:
- Develop campaigns highlighting local "food heroes" (e.g., farmers, indigenous leaders, youth innovators) and cultural food practices, shared via multimedia platforms.
- Create multilingual storytelling platforms to showcase success stories, such as Aisha's journey in Mali, reaching 500,000 people by 2028.
- Integrate qualitative Key Performance Indicators (KPIs), like stakeholder trust, into narratives to demonstrate impact beyond numbers.

**Example Quote**:
- "With TEK and SMS alerts, I saved my millet crop from drought," says Aisha, a Malian farmer, featured in a campaign brief to highlight the framework's impact.

**Case Example**:
- A comic series depicting a Peruvian farmer preserving potato varieties in the Potato Park, shared in schools to educate youth on biodiversity.

*Accessible explanation*: Share real stories of farmers and communities to show how the plan works and inspire others to join.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 4 (Quality Education) and UNDRIP.

## <a id="digital-accessibility"></a>Digital Accessibility
**Objective**: Ensure inclusive access to communication materials across all contexts.

**Strategies**:
- Develop offline content packages for low-bandwidth areas, including compressed video files, text-only versions, and downloadable mobile apps that sync when internet is available.
- Create audio broadcasts in local languages for regions with limited literacy, targeting 20 radio stations by 2027.
- Implement Progressive Web App technology for the globalgovernanceframework.org platform, ensuring functionality even with spotty connections.
- Use visual communication (icons, infographics) to transcend language barriers, with screen reader compatibility for visually impaired users.

*Accessible explanation*: Make sure everyone can access information, even in places with limited internet or language differences.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 10 (Reduced Inequalities).

## <a id="crisis-communication"></a>Crisis Communication
**Objective**: Maintain framework communication during emergencies and conflicts.

**Strategies**:
- Establish a crisis communication protocol with alternative platforms (e.g., SMS networks, satellite phones) for areas affected by conflict or natural disasters.
- Create emergency information kits covering food security measures, adapted for distribution by NGOs and UN agencies in crisis zones.
- Develop "Framework Continuity Guides" for local champions to maintain community engagement when external communication is disrupted.
- Partner with humanitarian organizations to ensure framework messaging aligns with emergency food response efforts.

**Example**:
- In conflict zones, local radio broadcasts continue sharing regenerative farming techniques using solar-powered equipment provided through humanitarian channels.

*Accessible explanation*: Keep sharing important information even during wars or disasters, using backup communication methods.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 16 (Peace, Justice, and Strong Institutions).
