The *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework* operates within the **Golden Triangle ecosystem**, requiring shared terminology across the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and [Integrated Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance). This expanded glossary provides quick-reference definitions organized by theme, ensuring clarity for all stakeholders‚Äîfarmers, policymakers, indigenous communities, youth, and global partners. By integrating terminology from all three core frameworks, the glossary supports the holistic approach needed to transform food systems through institutional reform, Indigenous wisdom, and systemic coordination.
