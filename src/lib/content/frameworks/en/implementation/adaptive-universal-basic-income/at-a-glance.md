## **AUBI: At a Glance 🌱**

What if our economy valued care, creativity, and a healthy planet? That's the vision of the Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI).

#### **What is it?** 💖
A new kind of economic system that provides a **safety net** for everyone, while also acting as a **launching pad** for you to contribute your unique gifts to the world.

#### **How Do You Participate?** 🤝
It's a simple, four-layer system designed to recognize all types of value:

* **Layer 1: Your Foundation to Live.** 🏠
    You receive a universal baseline income to cover essential needs with dignity. No strings attached.
* **Layer 2: Your Chance to Contribute.** ✨
    You can earn extra by doing meaningful work—caring for an elder, restoring a local forest, teaching a skill, or creating art.
* **Layer 3: Your Right to Fairness.** ⚖️
    The system provides extra support to repair historical injustices and help those with greater needs, like caregivers or people with disabilities.
* **Layer 0: Your Community's Heartbeat.** ❤️
    We honor the simple acts of kindness, wisdom, and connection that can't be measured but hold our communities together.

#### **How Does it Work?** 🌍
* **New Kinds of Money:** We use **Hearts (`♥`)** to reward care and community work, and **Leaves (`🍃`)** to reward healing the planet.
* **Community Governed:** This isn't a top-down system. It's guided by local communities and Indigenous leaders through the **Social Resilience Council**.
* **Our Goal:** To move beyond measuring "stuff" (GDP) and start measuring what really matters: **Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI)**.

**AUBI is our plan to build an economy where everyone doesn't just survive, they flourish.**
