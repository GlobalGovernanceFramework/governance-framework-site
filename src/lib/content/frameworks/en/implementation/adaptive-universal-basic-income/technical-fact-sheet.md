# Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) Framework At-A-Glance

**Version 5.0** | **Indigenous-Guided, Treaty-Integrated Synthesis** | **July 2025**

## **The Vision: Economics of Right Relationship**

AUBI transforms global economic systems from engines of inequality into infrastructure for universal flourishing through Indigenous-guided governance, care economy recognition, and regenerative abundance principles integrated with the Treaty for Our Only Home's comprehensive governance transformation.

**Core Philosophy**: Economic security as sacred right enabling Right Relationship between human, more-than-human, and planetary communities, measured through Love, Meaning, and Connection rather than accumulation and competition.
