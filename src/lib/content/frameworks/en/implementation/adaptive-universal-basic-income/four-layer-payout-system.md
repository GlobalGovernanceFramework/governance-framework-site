# Four-Layer Payout System: Recognizing All Forms of Wealth

> *"True wealth flows in rivers we have never learned to measure—the grandmother's wisdom shared over evening tea, the neighbor's help during illness, the forest's gift of clean air and water. Our economics must finally recognize what our hearts have always known: the most valuable work is often the most invisible."*

The AUBI payout system recognizes that human value extends far beyond market transactions, creating multiple pathways for economic participation that honor different forms of contribution while ensuring everyone's basic needs are met unconditionally. This four-layer architecture moves from philosophical foundation to practical implementation, transforming economic systems from scarcity-based competition to abundance-based cooperation.

## Layer 0: Relational Wealth (Philosophical Foundation)

**Layer 0** honors the unmonetized contributions that form the foundation of healthy communities—kinship care, spiritual guidance, cultural wisdom transmission, and countless daily acts of generosity that make life meaningful but never appear in economic accounting.

### The Invisible Economy of Care

Every day, billions of people contribute to community wellbeing through activities that economists classify as externalities but that Indigenous wisdom recognizes as the heart of true wealth. Maya's grandmother teaching plant medicine knowledge to children creates relational wealth that no corporation can produce. Dr. Williams listening compassionately to patients experiencing trauma provides healing that extends far beyond medical treatment. Ambassador Chen's elder sharing stories that connect island history with climate resilience builds cultural wealth that preserves community identity across generations.

These contributions sustain communities but remain invisible to GDP calculations that only count monetary transactions. A grandmother caring for grandchildren while parents work registers as economic burden rather than wealth creation. Community members organizing mutual aid networks appear as unpaid labor rather than essential infrastructure. Elders sharing wisdom through storytelling seems economically irrelevant despite preserving knowledge that enables community survival.

**Relational wealth** encompasses all the ways people create value through relationship, care, and cultural transmission that make communities resilient, meaningful, and joyful. This wealth cannot be accumulated like money but grows stronger through sharing and circulation.

### Recognition Without Commodification

Layer 0 acknowledges relational wealth without forcing it into market frameworks that would destroy its essential nature. Some gifts become less valuable when monetized—the grandmother's wisdom loses power when treated as paid service rather than loving transmission between generations.

**Gratitude Tokens**: The Love Ledger enables communities to recognize relational wealth through gratitude tokens that acknowledge contributions without creating payment obligations. When Maya's grandmother shares traditional knowledge, participants can record gratitude that becomes visible to the community without transforming sacred teaching into economic transaction.

**Ceremonial Recognition**: Communities develop their own protocols for honoring relational wealth through traditional ceremonies, community gatherings, and cultural celebrations that recognize essential contributions while preserving their sacred or communal character.

**Mentorship Pathways**: Layer 0 contributors receive priority access to mentorship opportunities and pathways into formal contribution systems when they choose to expand their economic participation. The grandmother teaching plant knowledge might become a paid instructor in traditional medicine programs if she wishes, but her informal teaching remains valuable whether or not she chooses formal recognition.

### Cultural Adaptation

Different communities define relational wealth according to their values, traditions, and social structures. Arctic communities might emphasize ice knowledge sharing and seasonal survival skills. Desert communities might prioritize water stewardship wisdom and heat adaptation practices. Urban communities might focus on neighborhood network maintenance and cultural bridge-building.

Indigenous communities maintain full authority over which aspects of their relational wealth they choose to make visible through Love Ledger systems, with sacred knowledge remaining protected under traditional protocols regardless of economic recognition opportunities.

## Layer 1: Universal Baseline (Hybrid Fiat/Hearts)

**Layer 1** guarantees dignified survival for all adults through unconditional payments that eliminate survival anxiety and enable people to refuse exploitative work while contributing their gifts to community flourishing.

### Freedom from Survival Work

The universal baseline transforms the fundamental relationship between survival and work. Currently, most people work primarily to avoid homelessness, hunger, and medical bankruptcy rather than to contribute their authentic gifts to community wellbeing. This survival imperative forces people into jobs that may be meaningless, harmful, or exploitative while preventing them from offering their true talents.

Dr. Williams sees this dynamic constantly—patients choosing between medication and rent, families skipping medical care due to cost, healthcare workers burning out in understaffed systems because leaving means losing health insurance. The survival imperative degrades both worker dignity and service quality.

**Unconditional Economic Security**: Layer 1 provides sufficient income to meet basic needs in dignity without work requirements, means testing, or bureaucratic surveillance. This follows the Alaska Permanent Fund model where all residents receive annual dividends simply by living in the state, creating economic security that enables rather than constrains human potential.

Regional calculations ensure Layer 1 payments reflect local cost-of-living while maintaining living wage standards. Rural communities with lower cash costs but greater self-reliance needs receive resource access support. Urban communities with higher housing costs receive increased cash payments. Island communities with import dependencies receive supply chain security assistance.

### Hybrid Currency Implementation

Layer 1 operates through innovative currency mix that balances immediate purchasing power with community wealth circulation:

**70% Traditional Currency**: Fiat payments ensure access to housing, healthcare, education, and other services priced in national currencies. This portion enables full participation in existing economic systems while communities develop Hearts-accepting businesses and services.

**30% Hearts Currency**: Hearts payments create parallel economic flows that prioritize care relationships and community resilience. This portion grows local economic sovereignty while connecting communities to global Hearts circulation networks that strengthen through use rather than accumulation.

Maya's community uses Hearts payments to support traditional food systems, cultural education programs, and ecological restoration projects that strengthen community identity while meeting practical needs. Hearts circulation keeps wealth within the community rather than extracting it to distant shareholders.

### Youth Integration and Education

**Education Stipends**: Young people aged 16-18 receive education-focused support that can include formal schooling, apprenticeships, traditional knowledge learning, or community service programs. This ensures youth have time to develop their gifts rather than entering the workforce prematurely due to family economic pressure.

**Civic Internships**: Optional programs enable youth to contribute to community projects while learning governance, ecological stewardship, or cultural preservation skills. These internships provide additional Hearts income while developing next-generation leadership capacity.

Ambassador Chen's island nation offers civic internships in coastal restoration, traditional navigation, and climate adaptation planning that prepare youth for meaningful adult roles while addressing urgent community needs.

### Work Liberation Foundation

Layer 1 provides the economic foundation for the Work in Liberation Framework's Community Work Teams by ensuring freedom from survival work. When basic needs are guaranteed, people can choose work based on passion, purpose, and community need rather than merely economic desperation.

This transforms employment relationships from coercion-based to contribution-based. Dr. Williams could reduce her clinical hours to focus on community health education and traditional medicine integration without risking her family's security. Maya could dedicate more time to traditional ecological knowledge preservation without sacrificing her household's economic stability.

## Layer 2: Contribution & Development Bonus (Hearts Currency)

**Layer 2** rewards verified contributions to love, meaning, and connection through Hearts currency payments that make visible and economically valuable the care work, cultural preservation, and community organizing that sustains thriving societies.

### Love Contributions: Building Community Connection

Love contributions encompass all activities that strengthen caring relationships and community solidarity, addressing the epidemic of loneliness and social isolation that undermines both individual wellbeing and collective resilience.

**Caregiving Recognition**: Direct care for children, elders, people with disabilities, and others needing support receives Hearts payments that acknowledge this work as skilled labor essential for community functioning. Dr. Williams receives Hearts for training community health workers, not just for treating individual patients.

**Mentorship and Teaching**: Sharing knowledge, skills, and wisdom through informal education receives economic recognition whether or not it occurs within formal educational institutions. Maya earns Hearts for teaching traditional ecological knowledge to youth, preserving cultural wisdom while building next-generation capacity.

**Conflict Resolution and Mediation**: Building peace within and between communities through restorative justice, traditional mediation practices, and conflict transformation receives Hearts recognition. This includes both formal mediation training and traditional peacemaking roles that prevent conflicts from escalating.

**Community Organizing**: Building collective capacity for democratic participation, mutual aid, and social change receives Hearts compensation. This includes organizing neighborhood networks, facilitating community assemblies, and developing cooperative enterprises that strengthen local economic sovereignty.

### Meaning Contributions: Cultural and Spiritual Wealth

Meaning contributions address the crisis of purpose that affects communities when traditional cultures are displaced and spiritual practices marginalized by purely materialistic economic systems.

**Cultural Preservation**: Maintaining languages, ceremonies, stories, and traditional practices receives Hearts recognition for work that preserves community identity while contributing to global cultural diversity. Indigenous communities earn Hearts for language revitalization programs that strengthen cultural continuity.

**Knowledge Sharing**: Teaching both traditional and contemporary knowledge through formal and informal channels receives economic recognition. This includes everything from traditional craft instruction to citizen science education to spiritual guidance within appropriate cultural frameworks.

**Spiritual Care**: Providing spiritual support, ceremony facilitation, and meaning-making assistance receives Hearts compensation within culturally appropriate boundaries. This recognizes that human wellbeing includes spiritual dimensions often ignored by purely secular economic systems.

**Artistic Expression**: Creating art, music, literature, and other cultural expressions that enrich community life receives Hearts recognition, especially when it serves community celebration, education, or healing rather than purely individual expression.

### Connection Contributions: Ecological Stewardship

Connection contributions reward activities that restore and maintain healthy relationships between human communities and natural systems, addressing climate change through regenerative practices rather than merely technological solutions.

**Ecological Restoration**: Direct habitat restoration, species protection, and ecosystem repair receives Leaves tokens that integrate with carbon markets while prioritizing community knowledge and benefit over corporate profit extraction.

Maya's community earns Leaves for coral reef restoration that combines traditional knowledge with contemporary marine science, creating more effective restoration while maintaining Indigenous sovereignty over marine territories.

**Food Sovereignty**: Developing local food systems, seed preservation, and regenerative agriculture receives Hearts and Leaves recognition that strengthens community resilience while reducing dependence on industrial agriculture systems that degrade both soil and rural communities.

**Regenerative Practices**: Water conservation, renewable energy development, sustainable building, and other practices that reduce ecological impact while meeting human needs receive Leaves compensation scaled to environmental benefit and community control.

### Work in Liberation Coordination

Layer 2 contributions integrate seamlessly with Community Work Teams from the Work in Liberation Framework, enabling coordinated recognition of collective projects alongside individual contributions.

**Team Contribution Pools**: Work teams share Hearts earnings based on collective projects while individuals receive personal recognition for specific skills and leadership contributions. This balances cooperative work culture with individual gift acknowledgment.

**Skills Development Pathways**: The Love Ledger tracks learning progressions that enable people to develop new contribution capacities over time, with mentorship relationships receiving Hearts recognition for both teachers and learners.

**Cultural Practice Integration**: Teams adapt their work rhythms to seasonal cycles, ceremonial calendars, and cultural practices rather than imposing standardized productivity requirements that ignore community values and ecological relationships.

## Layer 3: Equity & Needs-Based Supplement (Hearts Currency)

**Layer 3** addresses systemic inequities and provides additional support for health needs, caregiving responsibilities, and reparations for historical harms, ensuring that economic transformation serves justice rather than perpetuating existing inequalities.

### Addressing Systemic Inequities

Economic transformation must actively address rather than ignore the historical and ongoing inequities that concentrate wealth among privileged groups while marginalizing others based on race, gender, disability status, geographic location, and other factors beyond individual control.

**Disability Support**: Additional Hearts payments ensure people with disabilities have full economic participation regardless of their capacity for standardized forms of contribution. This includes personal assistance funding, accessibility technology support, and recognition that disability communities contribute wisdom about interdependence and alternative ways of organizing social life.

**Caregiving Intensification**: Families caring for multiple dependents, single parents, and others with intensive caregiving responsibilities receive additional Hearts support that recognizes care work as skilled labor deserving fair compensation rather than unpaid burden.

Dr. Williams advocates for patients whose disabilities prevent standard employment but whose lived experience of navigating healthcare systems makes them valuable contributors to patient advocacy and healthcare improvement efforts.

### Geographic and Climate Justice

**Geographic Equity**: Communities in remote locations with higher living costs or limited economic opportunities receive additional Hearts support that enables them to maintain their cultural practices and ecological stewardship without forced migration to urban centers.

**Climate Reparations**: Communities most affected by climate change despite contributing least to emissions receive priority access to Layer 3 support for adaptation projects and economic transition assistance. Ambassador Chen's island nation receives reparations funding for sea level rise adaptation that enables community survival while maintaining cultural sovereignty.

**Infrastructure Investment**: Layer 3 includes funding for community infrastructure that enables economic participation—renewable energy systems, communication technology, transportation networks, and other shared resources that benefit everyone while requiring collective investment.

### Restorative Justice Implementation

**Historical Harm Redress**: Layer 3 includes specific reparations protocols for communities harmed by slavery, colonization, genocide, and other systematic injustices that continue to affect economic opportunities through intergenerational trauma and stolen wealth.

Indigenous communities receive additional Hearts support for land restoration, language revitalization, and traditional governance strengthening that addresses ongoing impacts of colonization while building future resilience.

**Community Healing Support**: Funding for trauma-informed community programs, traditional healing practices, and restorative justice processes that address both individual and collective healing needed for communities to thrive rather than merely survive.

Maya's community receives Layer 3 support for healing programs that address intergenerational trauma from forced assimilation while strengthening traditional cultural practices that promote resilience and community connection.

### Health and Wellness Integration

**Healthcare Access**: Additional Hearts support ensures universal healthcare access regardless of employment status or ability to pay, integrating traditional healing practices with biomedical care according to community preferences and cultural protocols.

**Mental Health and Spiritual Care**: Recognition that mental health includes spiritual and cultural dimensions often ignored by purely biomedical approaches, with funding for traditional healing practices, community support networks, and culturally appropriate mental health services.

**Community Wellness Infrastructure**: Investment in shared resources that promote collective health—community gardens, recreational facilities, gathering spaces, and other infrastructure that enables community connection and mutual support.

## Gaming Prevention and Validation Protocols

All layers include sophisticated safeguards ensuring authentic contribution recognition while preventing exploitation or gaming of the system:

**Community Validation Networks**: Local communities verify contributions through traditional knowledge validation methods alongside technological verification, ensuring recognition flows to genuine service rather than performative activities.

**Transparent Appeals Process**: Clear procedures enable individuals and communities to challenge assessments or report suspected gaming, with appeals reviewed by diverse panels including Indigenous knowledge keepers and community representatives.

**Cultural Adaptation Requirements**: All validation protocols must accommodate different cultural approaches to work, reciprocity, and community contribution rather than imposing standardized metrics that ignore cultural diversity.

**Anti-Exploitation Safeguards**: Protection against employers or institutions pressuring people to participate in specific contribution activities, maintaining individual and community autonomy over economic participation choices.

## **The four-layer system transforms economics from scarcity-based competition to abundance-based cooperation, recognizing that true wealth includes relational, cultural, and ecological dimensions that traditional economics systematically ignores. It provides practical pathways for economic participation that honor different gifts and circumstances while ensuring everyone's basic needs are met unconditionally.**

**This architecture enables communities to implement economic transformation today while building toward planetary coordination that serves rather than exploits human potential and ecological systems. The layers work together to create economic security that liberates rather than constrains human creativity and community flourishing.**
