The AUBI Economic Architecture creates a revolutionary financing ecosystem that transcends traditional monetary systems, integrating fiat currencies, Hearts currency, Love Ledger value recognition, and automated productivity sharing. This pluralistic approach ensures economic resilience while enabling the recognition of care work, environmental stewardship, and community contribution that traditional markets systematically undervalue.

## <a id="diversified-financing-framework"></a>Diversified Financing Framework

### 1.1 Multi-Source Revenue Architecture

AUBI financing operates through six integrated revenue streams, creating redundancy and resilience while aligning funding sources with the values the system promotes:

**Primary Revenue Sources:**
- **Automation Tax (30-40% of funding)**: Progressive taxation on AI and automated production systems
- **Resource & Environmental Taxes (25-30% of funding)**: Carbon pricing, extraction fees, land value capture
- **Commons Dividends (15-20% of funding)**: Revenue from shared digital and natural resources
- **Hearts Currency System (10-15% of funding)**: Alternative value creation through care economy
- **Financial Transaction Taxes (5-10% of funding)**: Levies on speculation and high-frequency trading
- **Solidarity Contributions (5-10% of funding)**: Voluntary contributions from high-wealth individuals and institutions

### 1.2 Automation Tax: Smart Threshold System

**Triggering Mechanisms:**
The automation tax activates when technological systems meet specific productivity and displacement thresholds, ensuring taxation targets genuine productivity gains rather than penalizing innovation:

- **Productivity Threshold**: >30% increase in output per worker within 24 months
- **Displacement Threshold**: >10% reduction in human labor hours within the same sector
- **Combined Threshold**: Systems meeting both criteria subject to progressive taxation (5-25% of productivity gains)

**Implementation Protocol:**
- **Monitoring System**: AI-driven productivity tracking across sectors with quarterly assessments
- **Phased Implementation**: 5-year rollout starting with highly automated sectors (finance, logistics, manufacturing)
- **Innovation Protection**: R&D exemptions for breakthrough technologies demonstrating clear social benefit
- **Appeal Process**: Companies can contest assessments through Value Courts with economic impact evidence

**Revenue Projections:**
Based on current automation trends and conservative adoption estimates:
- **Year 1-2**: $50-100 billion globally from existing high-automation sectors
- **Year 3-5**: $200-400 billion as threshold coverage expands
- **Year 6-10**: $500-800 billion with comprehensive sector integration

### 1.3 Resource and Environmental Tax Integration

**Carbon Pricing Coordination:**
AUBI integrates with Treaty P4 (Planetary Health) carbon pricing mechanisms:
- **Global Carbon Price**: Coordinated pricing starting at $50/ton CO2, escalating to $150/ton by 2030
- **Border Adjustments**: Tariffs on imports from non-participating regions to prevent carbon leakage
- **Revenue Distribution**: 60% to AUBI baseline funding, 40% to climate adaptation and mitigation

**Extraction and Land Value Taxes:**
- **Resource Extraction Fees**: Progressive taxation on mineral, fossil fuel, and water extraction
- **Land Value Capture**: Site value taxation preventing speculation while funding community development
- **Data Extraction Levies**: Taxation on commercial data harvesting and algorithmic value extraction

**Biodiversity and Ecosystem Service Payments:**
- **Ecosystem Service Recognition**: Payments for verified ecosystem preservation and restoration
- **Biodiversity Credits**: Tradeable credits for habitat protection and species conservation
- **Regenerative Agriculture Support**: Premium payments for verified regenerative farming practices

### 1.4 Commons Dividends: Shared Value Creation

**Digital Commons Revenue:**
- **Platform Taxation**: Revenue sharing from digital platforms based on user-generated value
- **Data Commons**: Taxation on commercial use of collectively-generated data
- **Intellectual Property Reform**: Reduced patent terms with revenue sharing for community-developed innovations

**Natural Commons Revenue:**
