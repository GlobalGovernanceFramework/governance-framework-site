**Framework Development**: This framework represents a comprehensive synthesis of Indigenous wisdom, economic justice principles, and proven universal basic income models, developed through iterative refinement integrating traditional knowledge systems with contemporary economic security needs. While developed through analytical diversity, it stands on foundations of Indigenous gift economies, Alaska Permanent Fund success, and the urgent necessity for economic transformation that serves all life.

In a world where technological abundance coexists with deepening poverty, where care work goes unrecognized while speculation reaps massive rewards, where Indigenous communities face economic marginalization despite stewarding the planet's most biodiverse regions, the **Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)** Framework offers a revolutionary blueprint for economic transformation—positioning economic security not as charity, but as the foundation for human flourishing, ecological regeneration, and **Right Relationship** with all beings.

## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction: Beyond Survival to Flourishing

**The Challenge**: Current economic systems generate unprecedented inequality while technological advancement could enable abundance for all. Traditional welfare systems trap people in poverty while failing to recognize the care work, ecological stewardship, and cultural preservation that make communities thrive. Meanwhile, automation eliminates jobs faster than new ones are created, and GDP growth often comes at the expense of community wellbeing and ecological health.

**The Opportunity**: For the first time in human history, we possess the technological capacity and economic knowledge to guarantee economic security for every person while rewarding the work that matters most—caring for children and elders, restoring ecosystems, preserving cultures, and building community resilience. We can create economic systems that grow stronger through everyone's flourishing rather than concentrating wealth among the few.

**The Framework**: The AUBI Framework creates a comprehensive economic security system that transforms scarcity-based economics into abundance-based flourishing through:

- **Four-Layer Payout Architecture**: Universal baseline + contribution bonuses + equity adjustments + relational wealth recognition
- **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**: Replacing GDP with holistic metrics of human and ecological flourishing, integrated with the Biosphere Health Index from the Planetary Health Governance Framework
- **Hearts & Leaves Currency**: Alternative value systems rewarding care economy and ecological restoration, operating through the Love Ledger platform from the Financial Systems Framework
- **Social Resilience Council**: Indigenous-guided governance ensuring community sovereignty and cultural adaptation, coordinated through the Meta-Governance Framework
- Treaty Integration: Alignment with global governance transformation through the Treaty for Our Only Home's Global Commons Fund and enforcement mechanisms
- Right Relationship Foundation: Economic systems that honor interconnection between human, more-than-human, and planetary communities, grounded in Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance principles

This framework doesn't just provide income—it creates the economic foundation for regenerative civilization where every person has freedom to contribute their gifts while meeting their needs with dignity.

## <a id="aubi-philosophy"></a>The AUBI Philosophy: Economic Security as Sacred Relationship

At the heart of this framework lies a fundamental reimagining of economics—from systems of extraction and accumulation toward economies of **Right Relationship** that honor the sacred interconnection of all life:

- **Economic Security as Sacred Right**: Every person deserves freedom from survival anxiety as the foundation for creativity, service, and spiritual development
- Right Relationship Economics: Economic systems must honor relationships between humans, more-than-human beings, and planetary systems rather than treating them as resources for exploitation  
- Care Economy Recognition: The work that sustains life—caregiving, cultural preservation, ecological stewardship—becomes economically visible and rewarded through Hearts & Leaves Currency
- Regenerative Abundance: Economic systems that create wealth through healing rather than extraction, growing stronger through universal flourishing, measured through LMCI integration with the Biosphere Health Index

This philosophy transforms economics from competition for scarce resources into cooperation for abundant wellbeing, measured not by accumulation but by the quality of relationships and the health of the whole.

**AUBI vs Traditional UBI**: Where Universal Basic Income focuses on income provision, Adaptive UBI creates adaptive, culturally-responsive systems that evolve with community needs while rewarding meaningful contributions. It's the difference between a safety net and a launching pad for human potential, integrated with the Work in Liberation Framework to organize meaningful contributions and the Planetary Health Governance Framework to ensure ecological alignment.

## About This Framework

**Development Status**: The Adaptive Universal Basic Income Framework represents a comprehensive synthesis of Indigenous wisdom, economic justice principles, and proven universal basic income models developed through iterative research and community consultation. It operates as the economic foundation within the broader Global Governance Framework ecosystem, coordinating with Indigenous sovereignty, planetary health, meta-governance, financial systems, and work organization frameworks.

**Living Document Status**: This framework is designed for continuous improvement based on pilot program outcomes, community feedback, and emerging economic challenges. Version 5.0 represents comprehensive analysis as of July 2025, with regular updates planned based on implementation experience and coordination with other framework developments.

**Implementation Guidance**: The framework provides evidence-based guidance for economic security transformation. Implementation should involve consultation with Indigenous knowledge keepers first and foremost, economists, social policy experts, and communities familiar with local economic, cultural, and legal contexts while maintaining coordination across the full framework ecosystem.

**The Urgency of Economic Justice**: Current economic systems generate unprecedented inequality while technological advancement could enable abundance for all. Traditional welfare systems trap people in poverty while failing to recognize the care work that sustains communities. AUBI offers a pathway to economic systems that reward human flourishing, ecological regeneration, and Right Relationship over pure accumulation, as part of comprehensive planetary governance transformation.

**The Vision Within Reach**: Every person deserves freedom from survival anxiety. Every community deserves recognition for the care work that sustains it. Every society deserves economic systems that measure what truly matters—love, meaning, and connection. The tools exist. The evidence supports it. What remains is the collective will to choose flourishing over fear, cooperation over competition, and Right Relationship over exploitation, coordinated across all dimensions of planetary governance.

**It begins with economic security as sacred right. It culminates in regenerative civilization. It starts with community action today, coordinated with Indigenous leadership and comprehensive framework transformation.**
