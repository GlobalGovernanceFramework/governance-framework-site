## Appendix H: Reparations Protocol

When governance structures cause harm to communities they were established to serve, accountability must include concrete restoration and repair. This protocol establishes clear procedures for addressing harm when Regional Hubs or other framework structures require dissolution due to misconduct.

### Reparations Framework

**For hubs dissolved due to harm:**

#### 1. Identification of Affected Communities
- **Ombudsman identifies affected communities** through a transparent, trauma-informed process
- Identification process includes:
  - Public call for impact statements from potentially affected groups
  - Outreach to marginalized communities who may not self-identify
  - Documentation of both immediate and systemic harms
  - Mapping of impact patterns across communities and individuals
  - Assessment of historical context and pre-existing vulnerabilities
- Multiple forms of harm are recognized, including:
  - Exclusion from representation or participation
  - Misrepresentation of traditions or teachings
  - Exploitation of spiritual practices or knowledge
  - Reinforcement of historical power imbalances
  - Resource allocation inequities
  - Psychological and community trauma

#### 2. Asset Allocation for Repair
- **Allocates 20% of redistributed assets to reparations** (e.g., conflict resolution programs, memorials) directed specifically toward healing identified harms
- Allocation process includes:
  - Community-led determination of reparation priorities
  - Transparent decision-making about resource distribution
  - Multiple forms of reparation beyond financial compensation
  - Long-term support rather than one-time interventions
  - Attention to both individual and community-level repair
- Appropriate reparation forms may include:
  - Funding for community-led healing initiatives
  - Support for truth-telling and historical documentation
  - Resources for revitalizing marginalized spiritual traditions
  - Educational programs addressing root causes of harm
  - Physical memorials or commemoration initiatives
  - Infrastructure for ongoing intergroup dialogue and relationship building

#### 3. Comprehensive Documentation and Learning
- **Public report on lessons learned** to prevent repetition and ensure institutional memory
- Documentation includes:
  - Detailed analysis of factors leading to harm
  - Early warning signs that were missed or ignored
  - Intervention attempts and their outcomes
  - Successful and unsuccessful elements of the dissolution process
  - Recommendations for systemic changes to prevent similar situations
  - Perspectives from affected communities on the reparations process
- Public accessibility with appropriate cultural sensitivity
- Integration into framework training and governance procedures

### Implementation Process

#### Phase 1: Assessment and Documentation (1-2 months)
- Independent ombudsman appointed by Advisory Board
- Evidence gathering through multiple mechanisms
- Interviews with affected communities and hub participants
- Documentation review and analysis
- Preliminary report on nature and extent of harm

#### Phase 2: Community Consultation (2-3 months)
- Facilitated dialogues with affected communities
- Collaborative development of reparation priorities
- Exploration of culturally appropriate repair mechanisms
- Creation of draft reparations plan
- Public comment period on proposed approach

#### Phase 3: Reparations Implementation (ongoing)
- Establishment of implementation oversight committee
- Allocation of 20% of hub assets to reparation initiatives
- Regular public reporting on implementation progress
- Independent evaluation of impact and effectiveness
- Adjustments based on community feedback and outcomes

#### Phase 4: Integration of Lessons (concurrent with Phase 3)
- Development of case study for framework training
- Review of governance structures to address vulnerabilities
- Revision of policies and procedures based on lessons learned
- Integration of preventative measures in other hubs
- Archive creation for institutional memory

### Ethical Principles Guiding Reparations

#### Community Agency
- Affected communities lead in determining appropriate reparations
- Decision-making power rests primarily with those who experienced harm
- Framework provides resources and support rather than directing process

#### Cultural Appropriateness
- Reparation approaches honor the cultural contexts of affected communities
- Multiple cultural understandings of harm and healing are respected
- Diverse traditional and contemporary repair practices are incorporated

#### Transparency and Accountability
- All aspects of the reparations process are documented and publicly accessible
- Regular reporting on implementation and outcomes
- Independent verification of fulfillment of commitments
- Ongoing relationship and feedback mechanisms

#### Transformative Intent
- Focus on addressing systemic issues rather than merely symbolic gestures
- Connection between individual instances and broader patterns
- Commitment to preventing recurrence through structural change
- Balance between acknowledgment of past harm and forward-looking healing

### Case Application Example

In the hypothetical case of Regional Hub X being dissolved after investigation confirmed systematic exclusion of Indigenous spiritual voices:

1. The appointed ombudsman conducts community consultations, identifying three Indigenous communities whose perspectives were marginalized and whose sacred site access was negatively impacted by hub activities.

2. Through facilitated dialogue, affected communities determine priorities including: documentation of their spiritual traditions in their own words, capacity building for future interfaith engagement, and a healing ceremony at the affected sacred site.

3. The oversight committee allocates 20% of hub assets (approximately $50,000) to fund these initiatives over a three-year period, with implementation led by community representatives.

4. A comprehensive report documents how the exclusion occurred, identifying insufficient representation requirements and facilitator training as contributing factors, leading to framework-wide policy revisions.

This reparations protocol demonstrates the framework's commitment to accountability, healing, and continuous learning when harm occurs. By establishing clear processes for addressing misconduct, the framework builds trust and resilience while modeling the principles of justice it seeks to promote.
