The Environmental Stewardship Framework employs a comprehensive set of metrics to track progress, ensure accountability, and guide adaptive management. These metrics span climate, biodiversity, equity, economic, spiritual, technological, rights, and well-being dimensions, providing a holistic view of implementation impact. For each category, the framework establishes both long-term targets and intermediate milestones to facilitate regular assessment and course correction.

These metrics for success provide a comprehensive framework for assessing progress toward the transformative vision of the Environmental Stewardship Framework. By tracking multiple dimensions—from climate and biodiversity to equity, rights, and well-being—they ensure a holistic view of implementation impacts. The combination of long-term targets and intermediate milestones facilitates adaptive management, while diverse measurement approaches integrate scientific, indigenous, and community perspectives.

The metrics are designed not merely to track compliance but to stimulate learning and improvement throughout implementation. Regular reporting, transparent methodologies, and stakeholder participation in assessment ensure that metrics serve as tools for collective reflection and evolution rather than mere accountability mechanisms. Through this approach, the metrics become an integral part of the transformation process itself, helping to build the regenerative world envisioned by the framework.
