In a world facing interconnected ecological, economic, and ethical challenges, the *Environmental Stewardship Framework* delivers a transformative blueprint for regenerative governance, integrating spiritual wisdom, indigenous knowledge, economic innovation, and ethical technology. Recognizing the rights of all beings—human, non-human, ecological, and technological—it operates across local, regional, and global scales to foster thriving ecosystems, empowered communities, and ethical tech alignment. This master index serves as your gateway to the framework, connecting its comprehensive sections and inviting diverse stakeholders to co-create a world where environmental stewardship becomes a unifying force for planetary well-being.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The Environmental Stewardship Framework is a comprehensive plan for transformative environmental governance that addresses the interconnected challenges of ecosystem degradation, climate change, economic inequity, and technological ethics. It integrates spiritual, indigenous, economic, and technological dimensions of governance while embedding the principles of dignity, justice, and rights for all beings through the *Dynamic Rights Spectrum*.

**Purpose**: To build a regenerative world by 2050 where ecosystems thrive as rights-holders, communities exercise sovereignty, spiritual wisdom informs ethics, and technologies align with the well-being of all beings, guided by *Spiral-Aware* ethical evolution.

**Short-Term Vision (2028–2032)**: Achieve 30% ecosystem restoration in pilot regions, 50% local transaction share via AUBI, and 25 ecosystems with legal personhood, fostering early trust and momentum through interfaith and indigenous-led initiatives.

**Key Features**:
- Recognition of rights for ecosystems, species, and AI through the *Dynamic Rights Spectrum*
- Nested sovereignty empowering local-to-global governance
- Integration of economic tools like AUBI (Adaptive Universal Basic Income)
- Sacred technology aligning with spiritual and ecological ethics
- Indigenous co-governance with 50% representation in Regional Hubs
- Climate and biodiversity targets aligned with Paris Agreement and SDGs
- Global fund of $100B with equity-focused allocation
- Multi-format accessibility in diverse languages and media
- Phased implementation from 2026-2050 with clear milestones
