# Crisis Response Protocols

*Biotechnology crises can unfold with devastating speedâ€”a contained pathogen escapes its laboratory, a gene drive begins spreading beyond intended boundaries, or a synthetic organism displays unexpected behavior. These protocols ensure rapid, coordinated response while maintaining democratic accountability and community sovereignty even during emergencies.*
