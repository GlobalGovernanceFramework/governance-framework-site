# Getting Started

*Transforming biotechnology governance requires action from diverse stakeholders working together across communities, institutions, and cultures. This section provides clear entry points and practical first steps for anyone committed to ensuring that humanity's power to edit life's code serves healing and restoration rather than exploitation and harm. Every voice matters, every action counts, and every relationship built strengthens the movement for community-controlled biotechnology stewardship.*
