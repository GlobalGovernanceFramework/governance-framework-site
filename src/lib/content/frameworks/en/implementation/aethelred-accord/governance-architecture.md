# Governance Architecture

*The governance of biotechnology requires institutions sophisticated enough to address complex technical questions while remaining accountable to those most affected by genetic interventions. This architecture functions as the "nervous system" of biotechnology stewardship—capable of rapid response to biosafety threats while ensuring democratic legitimacy, scientific rigor, and community sovereignty guide every decision affecting life's code.*
