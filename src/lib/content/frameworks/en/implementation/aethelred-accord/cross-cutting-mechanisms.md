# Cross-Cutting Mechanisms

*Effective biotechnology governance requires comprehensive systems that operate across all institutions and decisionsâ€”the connective tissue that ensures transparency, prevents corruption, enables meaningful participation, and maintains accountability to communities most affected by genetic interventions. These cross-cutting mechanisms transform governance from a series of isolated decisions into an integrated ecosystem serving community sovereignty and planetary healing.*
