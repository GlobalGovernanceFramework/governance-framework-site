# Implementation Roadmap

*Transforming biotechnology governance from corporate control to community stewardship requires a carefully orchestrated transition that builds trust through early successes while preparing for advanced challenges. This roadmap spans fifteen years, moving from pilot demonstrations through regional scaling to global coordination, always prioritizing Indigenous sovereignty and community consent over implementation speed.*
