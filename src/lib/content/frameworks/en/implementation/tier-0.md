## Tier 0: The Constitutional Layer

This foundational tier is the absolute prerequisite for the entire Global Governance Framework. It contains the singular **`Treaty for Our Only Home`**, which provides the legal and institutional "hardware" for the new global system. By reforming the core architecture of international law and authority, Tier 0 makes all subsequent coordination and enforcement possible.
