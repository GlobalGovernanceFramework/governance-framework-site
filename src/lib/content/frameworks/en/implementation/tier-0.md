## Tier 0: Global Institutional Reform

This foundational tier serves as the prerequisite for all others. It is the operating system upgrade for global governance, focusing on the core rules, bodies, and legal frameworks that make coordinated international action possible. By reforming the fundamental architecture of our global institutions, Tier 0 unlocks the capacity to effectively address the challenges in every subsequent tier.
