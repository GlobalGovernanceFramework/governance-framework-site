In a world where aging populations represent humanity's greatest untapped resource, the *Aging Population Support Framework* offers a revolutionary blueprint for transformation—positioning elders not as burdens, but as the architects of regenerative economies and thriving communities. Grounded in dignity, agency, and intergenerational wisdom, this framework reimagines aging as society's greatest strength, empowering elders from rural villages to urban centers to lead their own transformation while building economic systems that grow stronger through their participation.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The framework is a comprehensive plan to transform global aging support systems, addressing interconnected challenges of economic insecurity, social isolation, ageism, and untapped elder potential. It integrates strategic innovations—from Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) to Elder-Led Governance—with phased implementation strategies and robust monitoring systems. Aligned with UN human rights frameworks, climate adaptation goals, and intergenerational justice principles, it prioritizes elder agency, meaningful occupation, and regenerative economics.

**Vision**: Transform aging from a societal burden into a cornerstone of thriving communities through dignity, purpose, and intergenerational connection, WITH elders as primary architects of their own support systems.

**2040 Commitment**: Every elder lives with economic security, social purpose, respected voice, and agency over their own aging journey.

**Key Features**:
- **Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)** with contribution recognition and elder-led technology governance
- **Elder-First Innovation Ecosystem** including Economic Zones and Councils of Wisdom Keepers
- **Regenerative Care Systems** with mutual care networks and elder-owned cooperatives
- **Climate Integration** positioning elders as Climate Wisdom Keepers and Adaptation Council leaders
- **Nested Governance** from local elder cooperatives to global coordination mechanisms
- **Comprehensive Safeguards** including technology rights and cultural sensitivity protocols
- **Evidence-Based Implementation** with longitudinal tracking and randomized controlled trials
- **Elder Agency** at every level—elders lead, design, and evaluate their own support systems

**Target Metrics by 2035**: 80% elder economic inclusion, 70% reduction in age discrimination, 90% healthcare access, 50% reduction in elder isolation, 60% elder political participation.

## <a id="framework-sections"></a>Framework Sections
The framework is organized into 9 comprehensive sections, each a critical component of its transformative design. Explore them below:
