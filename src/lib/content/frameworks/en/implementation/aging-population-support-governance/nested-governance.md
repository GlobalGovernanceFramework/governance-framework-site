Elder agency requires governance systems that enable elders to lead their own policy development, implementation, and evaluation from local communities to global coordination. Current aging policies are typically developed by younger politicians and bureaucrats with minimal elder input, creating systems that serve institutional needs rather than elder priorities. Nested governance creates interconnected decision-making systems where elders control aging policy at every level while enabling coordination and resource sharing across communities, regions, and nations.

## Framework Integration and Governance Coherence

Nested governance creates the democratic foundation enabling elders to control their own support systems while building cooperation and resource sharing across communities and nations. Local elder cooperatives provide the democratic base where elders design their own support systems, while regional networks enable resource sharing and knowledge exchange. Global South integration ensures framework adaptation for diverse cultural and economic contexts, while international coordination provides support and accountability.

Anticipatory governance ensures systems evolve with changing conditions while maintaining elder agency and democratic control. Together, these governance systems create a global framework where elders lead their own policy development while building cooperation across communities, cultures, and nations.
