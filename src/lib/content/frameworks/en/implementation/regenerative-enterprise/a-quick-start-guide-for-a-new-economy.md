## **🚨 Red Flags: When to Pause and Reassess**

⛔ **Leadership resistance to consciousness work** → REF requires authentic transformation, not just process change  
⛔ **Employee LMCI scores declining** → Address culture and wellbeing before expanding modules  
⛔ **Community stakeholders feeling tokenized** → Ensure genuine power-sharing and decision authority  
⛔ **Hearts/Leaves generation stagnating** → Reassess community engagement and ecological impact  
⛔ **Investor pressure overriding regenerative goals** → Consider steward-ownership transition

The Regenerative Enterprise Framework isn't a destination—it's a continuous evolution toward businesses that heal rather than harm. Every small step matters. Every pilot project contributes to a larger transformation. Every Hearts currency generated and every Leaves earned represents real healing in communities and ecosystems.

**You're not just changing your business. You're helping birth a new economy.**
