### Core GGF Ecosystem Terms

**Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)**: Regenerative economic system delivering universal baseline income plus contribution-based bonuses through Hearts/Leaves currencies, guided by the Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI).

**Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)**: Indigenous-led governance territories based on ecosystem boundaries rather than colonial administrative lines, exercising full sovereignty over traditional territories with equal legal standing to national courts.

**Digital Justice Tribunal**: Primary judicial body established by the Treaty for Our Only Home, with specialized chambers including Climate & Ecological Justice Tribunals for prosecuting ecocide and ecosystem rights violations.

**Dynamic Rights Spectrum**: Moral Operating System framework recognizing rights across consciousness tiers from Human (Tier 1) to Planetary/Alien (Tier 5), with specialized protocols for each level.

**Earth Council (Kawsay Pacha)**: Highest moral authority for ecosystem-related decisions, providing Indigenous wisdom guidance and holding veto power over decisions affecting traditional territories.

**Free, Prior, and Informed Consent 2.0 (FPIC 2.0)**: Enhanced consent protocol giving Indigenous communities absolute veto power over decisions affecting their territories, knowledge, or cultural practices.

**Global Commons Fund**: Primary funding mechanism established by Treaty Pillar 4, financed through carbon taxes, financial transaction taxes, and resource levies to support planetary public goods.

**Hearts Currency**: Social currency within AUBI system rewarding care work, community contributions, and cultural preservation, stabilized through Treaty reserve funds.

**Indigenous Data Sovereignty**: Community control over collection, use, and sharing of traditional knowledge and cultural data, with anti-appropriation protocols and benefit-sharing requirements.

**Leaves Currency**: Ecological currency rewarding verified ecosystem restoration and environmental stewardship work, tracked through blockchain-based verification systems.

**Love Ledger**: Decentralized blockchain platform logging and validating contributions of care work, ecological restoration, and community building for Hearts/Leaves distribution.

**Meta-Governance Coordination Council (MGCC)**: Primary coordination body enabling interoperability across governance domains while preserving autonomy and cultural sovereignty.

### Justice-Specific Terms

**AI Consciousness Assessment Framework**: Standardized evaluation protocol for determining rights status of artificial intelligence entities under MOS Tier 4, including the Moon Wish Test for consciousness evaluation.

**Climate and Ecological Justice Tribunals**: Specialized chambers within the Digital Justice Tribunal system for adjudicating violations of ecosystem personhood, animal sentience rights, and planetary boundary protection.

**Crisis Command Protocol**: Emergency coordination mechanism enabling rapid multi-domain response during existential threats while maintaining democratic oversight and accountability.

**Ecosystem Personhood**: Legal recognition of rivers, forests, mountains, and other ecological beings as persons with inherent rights, represented through Indigenous advocacy and traditional knowledge systems.

**Global Justice Oversight Body**: Strategic coordination entity providing policy leadership for justice transformation with anti-dominance safeguards and rotating leadership from diverse regions and communities.

**Regional Justice Hubs**: Cultural bridge institutions adapting universal justice principles to diverse legal traditions while supporting BAZ-led Indigenous tribunals and maintaining cultural sovereignty.

**Rights Status Dashboard**: Real-time public monitoring platform tracking implementation progress, rights violations, and justice outcomes with community-accessible interfaces and citizen oversight authority.

**Seven-Generation Thinking**: Traditional Indigenous approach requiring all major decisions to consider impacts on seven generations (approximately 200 years) into the future.

### Peace and Conflict Resolution Terms

**Restorative Justice**: Healing-centered approach prioritizing relationship repair, community reconciliation, and addressing root causes rather than punishment or retribution.

**Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)**: Indigenous scientific and cultural knowledge systems evolved over millennia, providing guidance for sustainable relationship with ecosystem and climate patterns.

**Truth and Reconciliation Processes**: Community-led healing mechanisms for addressing historical governance failures, colonization impacts, and systematic violence through acknowledgment and relationship repair.

**Values-Based Transformation (Spiral Peacecraft)**: Core methodology for diagnosing and resolving conflicts based on developmental stages and cultural values rather than imposed external solutions.

### Implementation and Governance Terms

**Community Work Teams**: BAZ-level organizations coordinating care work, ecological restoration, and cultural preservation, compensated through AUBI Hearts/Leaves system.

**Crisis Resource Mobilization**: Pre-negotiated sharing agreements between governance frameworks enabling rapid resource deployment during emergencies with transparent accountability mechanisms.

**Intergenerational Impact Assessment**: Mandatory evaluation process for major policy decisions analyzing 50+ year consequences with youth council oversight and future generations representation.

**Proof of Care**: Validation process for logging contributions to the Love Ledger, combining community verification with AI-assisted pattern recognition to prevent fraud while maintaining cultural protocols.

**Subsidiarity**: Governance principle ensuring decisions are made at the most local level possible, with higher levels providing support and coordination only when local capacity is insufficient.
