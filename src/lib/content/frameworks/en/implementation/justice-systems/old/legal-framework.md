The Legal Framework establishes a revolutionary pluralistic justice architecture that recognizes Indigenous sovereignty as foundational to planetary law while creating coordination mechanisms between diverse legal traditions. Operating within the institutional reforms of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars), guided by [Traditional Ecological Knowledge](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#core-principles), and coordinated through [Meta-Governance principles](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles), this framework transforms global law from colonial extraction toward regenerative relationship.

### <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The Legal Framework establishes a revolutionary **dual-jurisdiction system** where Indigenous law operates with equal—and often superior—authority to colonial legal frameworks, particularly within traditional territories. This represents a fundamental departure from hierarchical legal systems toward **legal pluralism** that honors the diversity of human governance wisdom while enabling coordination for planetary challenges.

**Foundational Recognition**: Indigenous communities, restorative court systems are similar to traditional systems where a council of tribal elders or community leaders will facilitate conversations to resolve interpersonal problems. In this type of resolution, the compliance of the offender is necessary for the families involved. Most importantly, this process attempts to heal the underlying means for a crime, preventing repetitive behavior and aiding the offender's reintegration into the community...Tribes are increasingly embracing Indigenous-based restorative justice models, which have regenerated Tribal jurisdiction and enhanced the well-being of Tribal members.

**Integration with Golden Triangle**:
- **Indigenous Framework Primary Authority**: [Earth Council](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) provides moral and legal guidance for all planetary law, with [Bioregional Autonomous Zones](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) operating as sovereign legal jurisdictions
- **Treaty Institutional Mechanisms**: Enhanced [International Court of Justice and International Criminal Court](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) serve as apex institutions for violations of international law, while [Global Enforcement Mechanism](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) enforces ecocide prosecution and Rights of Nature protection
- **Meta-Governance Coordination**: [Pluriversal governance recognition](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) enables different legal traditions to interoperate while [power-balancing mechanisms](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) prevent capture by colonial systems

**Legal Hierarchy**: Indigenous law takes precedence within traditional territories, while coordination mechanisms enable respectful interaction between legal systems for issues crossing jurisdictional boundaries. The Indigenous World Court serves as the supreme authority for Indigenous rights and Rights of Nature violations globally.
