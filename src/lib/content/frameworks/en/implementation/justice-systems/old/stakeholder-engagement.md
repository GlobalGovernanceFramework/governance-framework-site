The Stakeholder Engagement section ensures that justice transformation is genuinely **Indigenous-led and community-controlled** while creating respectful pathways for allied participation. Operating under [Earth Council](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) guidance and [Traditional Knowledge sovereignty](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#key-mechanisms), this engagement framework builds on the [feedback channels and public engagement strategies](/frameworks/justice-systems#monitoring-accountability) while centering Indigenous governance protocols, traditional consensus-building, and ceremonial decision-making. Aligned with [Meta-Governance principles](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) of power-balancing and pluriversal recognition, it transforms stakeholder engagement from colonial consultation toward Indigenous sovereignty and regenerative relationship.

### <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Stakeholder engagement is fundamentally **relationship-based** rather than transactional, grounded in Indigenous concepts of reciprocity, responsibility, and respect for all relations. This approach recognizes that meaningful engagement requires ongoing relationship-building, cultural protocol compliance, and recognition of Indigenous peoples as the primary authorities on sustainable governance and Traditional Knowledge.

**Foundational Principles for Engagement**:
- **Indigenous Sovereignty Recognition**: Indigenous peoples hold primary authority over engagement processes affecting traditional territories and cultural practices
- **Traditional Protocol Compliance**: All engagement conducted according to appropriate Indigenous cultural protocols and traditional governance requirements
- **Relationship Over Transaction**: Engagement focused on building long-term relationships rather than extracting consent or participation
- **Community Self-Determination**: Indigenous communities control their level and method of participation in all engagement processes

**Hierarchy of Engagement Authority**:
1. **[Earth Council](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components)** - Supreme authority for planetary engagement guidance and Traditional Knowledge protection
2. **[Bioregional Indigenous Councils](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components)** - Regional engagement coordination under traditional governance protocols
3. **Traditional Territory Governance** - Local Indigenous authority over engagement within traditional territories
4. **Allied Participant Coordination** - Non-Indigenous stakeholder engagement under Indigenous guidance and cultural protocol compliance

**Integration with Golden Triangle Frameworks**:
- **Indigenous Framework Primary Authority**: [Traditional governance protocols](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) and [ceremonial stewardship](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) guide all engagement approaches
- **Treaty Institutional Support**: [Global Citizens' Initiative](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) and [enhanced international courts](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) provide global engagement mechanisms while operating under Indigenous sovereignty constraints
- **Meta-Governance Coordination**: [Power-balancing mechanisms](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) and [pluriversal recognition](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) prevent engagement capture while enabling diverse participation

**Engagement Transformation Goals**:
- Increase Indigenous community control over justice transformation processes to 80% by Year 5
- Achieve 90% Indigenous community satisfaction with engagement approaches by Year 3
- Ensure 100% cultural protocol compliance in all engagement activities
- Establish Traditional Knowledge protection in 95% of engagement processes by Year 2
- Build long-term relationships rather than extractive consultation processes
