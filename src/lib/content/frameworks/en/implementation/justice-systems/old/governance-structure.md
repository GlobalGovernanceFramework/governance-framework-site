**Planned Visual Chart**: An organizational chart depicting the relationships between Indigenous-led governance bodies, reformed international institutions, and coordination mechanisms is under development and will be included in the [Appendices](/frameworks/justice-systems#appendices).

The Governance Structure establishes a revolutionary **Indigenous-led coordination model** that recognizes the [Earth Council](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) as the supreme moral and legal authority for planetary justice while creating respectful coordination mechanisms between diverse legal traditions. Operating through the institutional reforms of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) and guided by [Meta-Governance principles](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) of power-balancing and pluriversal recognition, this structure transforms global justice governance from colonial domination toward Indigenous sovereignty and regenerative relationship.

### <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The governance model operates through **Indigenous sovereignty as foundational authority** with coordination mechanisms that enable diverse justice systems to work together while maintaining their distinct cultural integrity. This represents a fundamental departure from hierarchical colonial structures toward **polycentric governance** where the wisdom of Indigenous peoples—who have maintained sustainable justice systems for millennia—guides planetary transformation.

**Authority Hierarchy**:
1. **[Earth Council](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components)** - Supreme moral and legal authority for planetary justice
2. **[Indigenous World Court](/frameworks/justice-systems#indigenous-world-court-system)** - Highest legal authority for Indigenous rights and Rights of Nature
3. **[Bioregional Autonomous Zones](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components)** - Sovereign legal jurisdictions under traditional law
4. **Reformed International Bodies** - Coordination mechanisms operating under Indigenous sovereignty principles
5. **Colonial Transition Systems** - Legacy institutions evolving toward Indigenous-aligned governance

**Meta-Governance Integration**: This structure embodies the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance) principles of **[polycentric coordination](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles)**, **[subsidiarity](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles)**, and **[power-balancing mechanisms](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles)** while ensuring that **[pluriversal governance recognition](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles)** enables different legal traditions to interoperate respectfully without forced assimilation.

**Treaty Institutional Support**: Reformed institutions created through the [Treaty's Pillar 1](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) provide implementation mechanisms while operating under Indigenous sovereignty constraints, ensuring institutional transformation serves Indigenous liberation rather than perpetuating colonial control.
