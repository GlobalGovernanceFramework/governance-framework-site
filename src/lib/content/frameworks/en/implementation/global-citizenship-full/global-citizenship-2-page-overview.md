- **Action:** Progressing from awareness to leadership (5 levels).
- **Systems Change:** Supporting innovations like **AUBI** (Adaptive Universal Basic Income) to enable participation.

## 🔹 **Start Today**
### **Tools & Practices**
- **🧰 AUBI Advocacy:** Support economic systems that free people to participate.
- **📱 Tech for Good:** Use AI translators to bridge language gaps.
- **🌱 Daily Rituals:** Pause to ask: *"Who benefits from my choices? Who bears the cost?" “What am I carrying that no longer serves—physically, digitally, monetarily and mentally?”*

### **Expanding the Circle**
Global citizenship now includes:
- **Non-humans:** Legal rights for rivers (New Zealand’s Whanganui River).

### 🧹 Digital Minimalism for the Planet
Start small:

🌍 *Each digital choice carries an ecological and mental weight.*

*Global citizenship starts with mindful data.*
