# Sacred Covenant for Planetary Trade

> *"We, the peoples of Earth, recognize that trade is ceremony—sacred exchange that strengthens the web of relationships connecting all beings. We covenant to transform commerce from a force of destruction into a regenerative practice that heals communities, restores ecosystems, and honors the gifts of our planetary home. May every transaction serve the flourishing of life for seven generations to come."*

## Our Sacred Commitment

At this pivotal moment in Earth's history, we acknowledge that our current trade systems have become engines of planetary destruction—extracting wealth from communities, depleting ecosystems, and concentrating power in the hands of the few. We covenant to transform this legacy, remembering that **trade is sacred exchange** carrying spiritual and ethical weight far beyond monetary transaction.

## The Ancient Teachings We Honor

**Trade is Ceremony**: Every exchange creates relationships and responsibilities extending across generations and species. We commit to conducting commerce with the reverence due to sacred practice.

**The Earth is Our Teacher**: Indigenous peoples worldwide demonstrate that sustainable commerce emerges from intimate relationship with place. We covenant to learn from Traditional Ecological Knowledge and honor Indigenous sovereignty over ancestral territories.

**Future Generations are Present**: In every trade decision, we hear the voices of children not yet born and species not yet evolved. We covenant to choose regeneration over extraction, healing over harm.

**The Commons Belong to All**: Oceans, atmosphere, forests, and genetic heritage are the shared inheritance of all life. We covenant to stewerd these gifts collectively, never allowing them to be monopolized or weaponized.

## Our Sacred Vows

We commit to worker ownership, community control, and cooperative enterprise. We covenant to ensure that those who create wealth through their labor and wisdom share fairly in its benefits.

We commit to preventing appropriation of traditional knowledge while supporting ethical sharing that benefits originating communities. We covenant to honor the spiritual dimensions of Indigenous wisdom.

### We Vow to Choose Local Resilience
We commit to bioregional production and circular economies that strengthen local communities while reducing transportation emissions. We covenant to support community self-reliance and mutual aid.

## The World We Are Creating

Through this sacred covenant, we are birthing a world where:

- **Children breathe clean air** because trade patterns prioritize renewable energy and forest restoration over fossil fuel extraction
- **Workers own their enterprises** and share fairly in the wealth they create through democratic cooperatives and community ownership
- **Indigenous communities control their territories** and benefit from their traditional knowledge rather than suffering extraction and appropriation
- **Local communities are resilient** through bioregional production systems that meet needs locally while trading surplus ethically
- **Ecosystems flourish** because commerce actively regenerates rather than depletes biodiversity, soil health, and water systems
- **Youth inherit abundance** rather than debt, degradation, and climate chaos

## Our Call to Action

This covenant is not merely aspiration—it is commitment requiring immediate action. We call upon:

**Individuals** to support businesses practicing regenerative trade and demand supply chain transparency from all enterprises

**Communities** to develop local production systems, cooperative enterprises, and bioregional trade networks

**Businesses** to adopt worker ownership, ecological restoration, and Indigenous sovereignty recognition as core practices

**Governments** to establish Regenerative Trade Zones, Indigenous Trade Councils, and planetary boundary enforcement

**International Institutions** to replace extractive trade agreements with frameworks serving planetary healing and community flourishing

## The Sacred Trust

We hold this covenant as sacred trust, knowing that our choices in this generation determine whether future generations inherit a world of abundance or scarcity, cooperation or conflict, healing or harm.

We commit to accountability—to each other, to the living Earth, and to the children of all species who depend on our wisdom and courage in this moment of unprecedented challenge and opportunity.

**May our trade serve the healing of the world.**  
**May our commerce strengthen the web of life.**  
**May our exchanges honor the sacred gift of our planetary home.**
