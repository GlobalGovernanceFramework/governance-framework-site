# Key Mechanisms & Policies: The Tools of Regenerative Trade

> *"Every mechanism is a ceremony, every policy a prayer for the healing of our relationships with each other and our planetary home."*

The Gaian Trade Framework deploys comprehensive mechanisms that transform trade flows from extractive to regenerative, creating the infrastructure for commerce that serves all life within planetary boundaries. These tools work together as an integrated system, each mechanism reinforcing the others while maintaining adaptability to diverse cultural and ecological contexts.

## Digital Product & Material Passports: Radical Transparency for Planetary Healing

**Goal**: Complete transparency and traceability for all goods, materials, and digital services flowing through global trade networks, ensuring every transaction serves regenerative principles.

### Technical Architecture & Sovereignty Protection

**Blockchain-Based Tracking Systems**: Built on quantum-resistant, energy-efficient blockchain infrastructure (Hyperledger Fabric or similar) showing:
- **Origin & Extraction**: Geographic location, extraction methods, and ecological impact at source
- **Composition & Materials**: Complete ingredient/component list with toxicity and biodiversity impact scores
- **Labor Conditions**: Worker rights compliance, living wage verification, neurodiversity accommodations
- **Energy & Water Footprint**: Lifecycle energy consumption including digital services' data center impacts
- **Circularity Score**: Repairability, recyclability, and end-of-life management protocols
- **Cultural Sensitivity Rating**: Protection of traditional knowledge and sacred resource protocols

**Data Sovereignty Compliance**: Governed by **Aurora Accord** standards with:
- Community-controlled privacy settings enabling selective transparency
- Indigenous data sovereignty protection for traditional knowledge
- Worker privacy protection while ensuring accountability
- Zero-knowledge proofs enabling verification without exposing sensitive information

### Implementation Across Sectors

**Physical Products**:
