*How do we govern technology appropriately—applying rigorous oversight to high-risk systems while avoiding bureaucratic burden on beneficial local innovations?*

The Technology Risk & Responsibility Tiering (TRRT) system solves one of governance's most persistent challenges: matching oversight intensity to actual risk and impact. Rather than applying one-size-fits-all regulations that either stifle innovation or allow harm, TRRT creates a graduated approach where governance requirements scale with technology's potential for community impact.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview: Why We Need Tiered Governance

### **The Governance Mismatch Problem**

Traditional technology regulation faces an impossible choice: either regulate everything heavily (crushing beneficial innovation) or regulate lightly (allowing harmful technologies to proliferate). TRRT offers a third path—intelligent scaling where governance intensity matches technology impact.

***Example in Action:*** *A community app helping neighbors share garden tools needs basic transparency and community oversight—not the same intensive review required for an AI system making medical diagnoses or a biotechnology that could affect entire ecosystems. TRRT ensures the garden app gets Tier 1 treatment (community-led, lightweight) while the medical AI gets Tier 3 scrutiny (full GTC review with extensive safety protocols).*

### **Core Design Principles**

**Subsidiarity in Practice**: Local governance for local-impact technologies, with higher-level coordination only when impacts cross community boundaries or threaten broader systems.

**Proportional Response**: Governance requirements that match technology risk—more oversight for greater potential harm, streamlined processes for beneficial community innovations.

**Cultural Adaptability**: Each tier allows communities to adapt governance approaches to their cultural contexts while maintaining interoperability standards.

**Dynamic Evolution**: Technologies can move between tiers as their impacts become clearer or as risks change over time.

## <a id="four-tiers"></a>The Four-Tier System

*How do we determine which technologies need which level of governance?*

### **Tier 1: Local/Low-Risk Technologies**

**Governance Philosophy**: Community-led oversight with transparency and basic safety requirements.

**Technology Examples**:
- Local community apps for sharing resources or organizing events
- Small-scale renewable energy systems for individual buildings or neighborhoods
- Community mesh networks and local communication systems
- Educational tools for local schools or community centers
- Neighborhood-scale transportation solutions (bike shares, local rideshare)

**Governance Requirements**:
- **Community Oversight**: Local Community Tech Review Board approval and ongoing monitoring
- **Public Logging**: Decision processes and community impact documented on public platforms
- **Basic Security**: Implementation of GGF Minimum Viable Security Stack fundamentals
- **Transparency**: Open-source code preferred; proprietary systems require public auditing
- **Community Consent**: Local community approval through accessible participation processes

***Example in Action:*** *When a neighborhood wanted to install a community energy storage system using solar panels and batteries, the local Community Tech Review Board evaluated safety, environmental impact, and community benefit. After three community meetings with technical experts and cultural elders, they approved the project with requirements for local job training and traditional ecological knowledge integration. The entire process took six weeks and was managed entirely at community level.*

### **Tier 2: Regional/Medium-Risk Technologies**

**Governance Philosophy**: Cross-community coordination with standardized assessment while maintaining community authority.

**Technology Examples**:
- Bioregional food distribution networks and supply chain platforms
- Regional renewable energy grids connecting multiple communities
- Educational technology platforms serving multiple schools or regions
- Regional transportation coordination systems
- Cross-community data sharing platforms with privacy protection

**Governance Requirements**:
- **Multi-Community Review**: Assessment by affected Community Tech Review Boards
- **GTC Standard Compliance**: Adherence to interoperability and safety standards
- **Cross-Community Audit**: Independent assessment of impacts on multiple communities
- **Enhanced Security**: Full GGF Minimum Viable Security Stack implementation
- **Regional Coordination**: Alignment with bioregional governance priorities

***Example in Action:*** *A food distribution platform connecting farmers across three bioregions required Tier 2 review. Community Tech Review Boards from each region evaluated local impacts, while GTC technical standards ensured data security and fair algorithmic matching between producers and consumers. Indigenous food sovereignty representatives ensured traditional foods and farming practices were protected. The review process took four months with continuous community input, resulting in platform modifications that better served smallholder farmers and maintained cultural food practices.*

### **Tier 3: Global/Systemic-Risk Technologies**

**Governance Philosophy**: Full GTC review with comprehensive safety assessment and international coordination.

**Technology Examples**:
- Social media platforms affecting millions of users across multiple regions
- Financial technology systems with cross-border implications
- Large-scale AI systems affecting employment or social structures
- Global communication infrastructure and internet backbone technologies
- Planetary-scale environmental monitoring or geoengineering systems

**Governance Requirements**:
- **Full GTC Review**: Comprehensive assessment by Global Technology Council
- **Cybersecurity Resilience**: Complete security audit by Cybersecurity & Resilience Council
- **Community Impact Assessment**: Systematic evaluation of effects on different communities
- **International Coordination**: Alignment with other global governance frameworks
- **Ongoing Monitoring**: Continuous assessment with community feedback integration

***Example in Action:*** *When a major tech corporation proposed a global AI system for content moderation across social media platforms, it triggered Tier 3 review. The GTC's comprehensive assessment involved technical experts evaluating algorithmic bias, Indigenous representatives ensuring cultural content protection, youth delegates assessing long-term social impacts, and cybersecurity specialists reviewing data protection. The nine-month review process resulted in requirements for community-controlled content policies, transparent bias reporting, and local cultural adaptation—ultimately making the system more effective while protecting community autonomy.*

### **Tier 4: High-Stakes/Specialized Technologies**

**Governance Philosophy**: Delegation to specialized frameworks with GTC coordination and oversight.

**Technology Examples**:
- Advanced artificial intelligence with potential consciousness or autonomy
- Genetic modification and synthetic biology affecting ecosystems
- Military and security technologies including autonomous weapons
- Space exploration and terraforming technologies
- Neurotechnology interfacing directly with human consciousness

**Governance Requirements**:
- **Specialized Framework Governance**: Delegation to Aurora Accord, Aethelred Accord, Shield Protocol, or Frontier Governance
- **GTC Coordination**: Ongoing alignment with universal technology governance principles
- **Earth Council Consultation**: Indigenous wisdom integration for technologies affecting planetary systems
- **Precautionary Protocols**: Enhanced safety requirements with burden of proof on technology developers
- **International Treaty Integration**: Alignment with global agreements and planetary protection protocols

***Example in Action:*** *A biotechnology company developed a synthetic organism designed to consume ocean plastic. While potentially beneficial, this Tier 4 technology was immediately handed to the Aethelred Accord for specialized biotechnology governance. The review process involved marine ecology experts, Indigenous ocean knowledge holders, and international environmental law specialists. After 18 months of assessment including small-scale contained trials, the organism was approved for limited deployment with extensive monitoring and immediate recall capability if unexpected ecological effects emerged.*

## <a id="classification"></a>Classification Criteria and Process

*How do we decide which tier a technology belongs in?*

### **Risk Assessment Framework**

**Impact Scope Evaluation**:
- **Geographic Reach**: How many communities and regions does the technology affect?
- **Population Impact**: How many people are directly or indirectly affected?
- **Temporal Duration**: Are effects temporary, long-term, or potentially permanent?
- **Reversibility**: Can negative effects be undone if problems emerge?

**Risk Category Assessment**:
- **Ecosystem Risk**: Potential for environmental harm or ecological disruption
- **Social Risk**: Effects on community relationships, cultural practices, and social cohesion
- **Economic Risk**: Impacts on livelihoods, economic systems, and wealth distribution
- **Security Risk**: Cybersecurity vulnerabilities and potential for malicious use
- **Autonomy Risk**: Effects on human agency and community self-determination

***Example in Action:*** *A proposed AI tutoring system initially seemed like Tier 1 (local education tool), but deeper assessment revealed it would collect detailed data on children's learning patterns, potentially affecting educational approaches globally, and posed risks of creating dependency on corporate education technology. These factors elevated it to Tier 3, requiring full GTC review with special attention to children's rights and educational sovereignty.*

### **Classification Process**

**Initial Assessment** (30 days):
1. **Self-Classification**: Technology developers submit initial tier assessment with supporting evidence
2. **Community Input**: Affected communities provide feedback through digital platforms and local assemblies
3. **Technical Review**: GTC technical experts evaluate claimed tier assignment
4. **Cultural Consultation**: Indigenous and community representatives assess cultural impacts

**Review and Determination** (60 days):
1. **Multi-Stakeholder Dialogue**: Structured discussion between developers, communities, and technical experts
2. **Risk Modeling**: Quantitative and qualitative risk assessment using standardized frameworks
3. **Precautionary Assessment**: Evaluation of uncertain but potentially serious risks
4. **Final Classification**: GTC determination with clear rationale and community input integration

### **Appeal and Modification Process**

**Developer Appeals**: Technology creators can appeal tier classifications they believe are too restrictive:
- **Evidence Submission**: Additional data about safety, community benefit, or risk mitigation
- **Community Support**: Demonstration of community support for the technology
- **Modified Implementation**: Proposed changes to address governance concerns
- **Independent Review**: Assessment by external experts not involved in initial classification

**Community Challenges**: Communities can request higher tier classification for technologies they believe pose underestimated risks:
- **Impact Documentation**: Evidence of actual or potential community harm
- **Cultural Concerns**: Demonstration of threats to cultural practices or sovereignty
- **Precautionary Requests**: Calls for additional caution in uncertain situations
- **Collective Action**: Coordination among multiple affected communities

## <a id="dynamic-retiering"></a>Dynamic Re-tiering and Appeals

*How do we ensure tier classifications remain accurate as technologies evolve and our understanding improves?*

### **Continuous Monitoring and Assessment**

**Annual Review Cycles**: Every technology undergoes yearly assessment to determine if tier classification remains appropriate based on:
- **Actual Impact Data**: Evidence of real-world effects on communities and ecosystems
- **Technology Evolution**: Changes in how the technology operates or is used
- **Scale Changes**: Expansion or contraction of technology deployment
- **New Risk Understanding**: Emerging evidence about potential harms or benefits

***Example in Action:*** *A community solar energy management system started as Tier 1 but gradually connected to regional grids and began using AI optimization. Annual review revealed it now affected multiple communities and involved complex algorithms, triggering re-classification to Tier 2 with additional oversight requirements for algorithmic transparency and cross-community coordination.*

### **Trigger-Based Re-evaluation**

**Automatic Review Triggers**:
- **Significant Harm Events**: Any technology causing unexpected community harm triggers immediate re-evaluation
- **Scale Expansion**: Technologies expanding beyond their original scope automatically undergo tier review
- **Community Petitions**: Formal requests from affected communities for tier re-evaluation
- **Technical Evolution**: Major changes to technology capabilities or implementation

**Emergency Re-tiering**: Technologies causing immediate harm can be rapidly moved to higher tiers with emergency governance protocols:
- **24-Hour Assessment**: Immediate risk evaluation by available GTC members
- **Community Protection**: Temporary restrictions to prevent ongoing harm
- **Full Review**: Comprehensive re-evaluation within 30 days
- **Compensation**: Support for communities affected by governance delays

### **Learning Integration**

**System-Wide Learning**: Insights from tier re-evaluations inform improvements to classification criteria and governance approaches:
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identifying common factors in misclassified technologies
- **Criteria Refinement**: Updating assessment frameworks based on implementation experience
- **Community Feedback Integration**: Incorporating community insights into governance improvement
- **Predictive Enhancement**: Improving ability to anticipate technology risks and benefits

## <a id="integration"></a>Cross-Tier Integration and Interoperability

*How do technologies from different tiers work together while maintaining appropriate governance?*

### **Interoperability Standards**

**Technical Standards**: All tiers share common technical foundations enabling coordination:
- **Communication Protocols**: Standardized ways for technologies to exchange information
- **Security Frameworks**: Shared cybersecurity standards scaling with tier requirements
- **Data Formats**: Common approaches to data sharing and privacy protection
- **Cultural Adaptability**: Technical standards that accommodate diverse community values

**Governance Coordination**: Higher-tier technologies must integrate with lower-tier community governance:
- **Community Override**: Local communities retain authority over how global technologies operate in their territories
- **Cultural Adaptation**: Technologies must adapt to local governance styles and decision-making processes
- **Benefit Sharing**: Higher-tier technologies must demonstrate benefit to affected lower-tier communities
- **Transparency**: All tiers maintain public documentation accessible to affected communities

***Example in Action:*** *When a Tier 3 global communication platform wanted to integrate with Tier 1 local mesh networks, it had to demonstrate that the integration would enhance rather than undermine community communication sovereignty. The integration required community-controlled data policies, local content moderation authority, and the ability for communities to disconnect from the global platform while maintaining local functionality.*

### **Cross-Tier Crisis Response**

**Coordinated Emergency Protocols**: When technological crises span multiple tiers, governance response scales appropriately:
- **Local Response**: Tier 1 technologies managed by community crisis protocols
- **Regional Coordination**: Tier 2 technologies coordinated across affected communities
- **Global Response**: Tier 3 technologies managed by GTC with community input
- **Specialized Crisis**: Tier 4 technologies handled by specialized frameworks with GTC coordination

## <a id="enforcement"></a>Enforcement and Compliance

*How do we ensure technologies actually follow their tier requirements?*

### **Graduated Enforcement Approach**

**Community-Based Enforcement** (Tiers 1-2):
- **Community Monitoring**: Local Community Tech Review Boards maintain ongoing oversight
- **Peer Pressure**: Public documentation creates social accountability
- **Community Sanctions**: Local communities can restrict or modify technology use
- **Technical Assistance**: Support for developers to achieve compliance rather than punishment

**Formal Enforcement** (Tiers 3-4):
- **GTC Sanctions**: Official warnings, funding restrictions, and operational limitations
- **Digital Justice Tribunal**: Legal proceedings for serious violations
- **International Coordination**: Enforcement coordination with other governance frameworks
- **Economic Consequences**: Exclusion from GGF economic incentives and certification programs

***Example in Action:*** *When a Tier 2 regional platform failed to implement required community consultation processes, affected Community Tech Review Boards first offered technical assistance and extended deadlines. When the company continued non-compliance, communities collectively withdrew support, leading to user migration to community-controlled alternatives. The economic pressure proved more effective than legal sanctions.*

### **Positive Incentives and Support**

**Compliance Support Rather Than Punishment**:
- **Technology Amnesty Program**: 12-24 month grace periods for existing technologies to achieve compliance
- **Technical Assistance**: Free support for developers working toward compliance
- **Community Mediation**: Conflict resolution between developers and communities
- **Economic Incentives**: Hearts and Leaves rewards for technologies serving community benefit

**Innovation Encouragement**:
- **Governance Sandboxes**: Safe spaces for experimental technologies to test governance approaches
- **Fast-Track Processes**: Expedited review for technologies with clear community benefit
- **Community Partnership**: Support for developer-community collaboration in technology design
- **Recognition Programs**: Public acknowledgment of exemplary community-serving technologies
