# Technology Governance Implementation Framework (TGIF) - At-a-Glance

**Version 3.2** | Tier 1 Global Technology Governance | Status: GGF-Integrated

---

## **Vision Statement**
Technology as sacred world-building partner—ensuring AI, biotech, and digital systems serve humanity, ecosystems, and future generations through proactive stewardship rather than reactive regulation.

---

## **Core Architecture**

### **The Global Technology Council (GTC)**
*Primary governance body with cybersecurity-enhanced structure*

**Composition:**
- 40% Technical Experts (AI, biotech, blockchain, cybersecurity)
- 30% Civil Society & Affected Communities  
- 20% Ethicists & Legal Scholars
- 10% Youth Delegates

**Key Sub-Council:**
- **Cybersecurity & Resilience Council** - Coordinates security across Shield Protocol, Aurora Accord, and Digital Commons Framework

### **Technology Risk & Responsibility Tiering (TRRT)**
Smart governance scaling with technology impact:

| **Tier** | **Technology Examples** | **Governance Level** | **Oversight** |
|----------|------------------------|---------------------|---------------|
| **Tier 1** | Community apps, local tools | BAZ oversight, light touch | Public logs, security audits |
| **Tier 2** | Regional platforms, services | GTC standards compliance | Cross-BAZ review |
| **Tier 3** | Social media, blockchain | Full GTC review | Global security stack |
| **Tier 4** | Frontier AI, biotech, military | Specialized frameworks | Expert committees |

---

## **Core Principles**

### **🛡️ Human-Centered Security**
- AI supports but never replaces human ethical reasoning
- Mandatory cybersecurity resilience protocols
- Fail-safe defaults and ethical circuit breakers

### **🌍 Indigenous Sovereignty**
- FPIC 2.0 required for tech deployment in/near BAZs
- Earth Council veto power over ecosystem-impacting tech
- Community right to adapt or reject technologies

### **⚖️ Technological Justice**
- Prevention of algorithmic wage theft
- Platform cooperative promotion
- Digital well-being by design (non-addictive interfaces)

### **🔄 Lifecycle Responsibility**
- Mandatory carbon footprint assessment
- Circular economy principles
- Biomimetic innovation incentives

---

## **Crisis Response System**

### **Tech Crisis Response Unit (TCRU)**
**6-hour containment** | **12-hour recovery** | **24-hour transparency**

**Triggers:**
- Tier 1 cyberattacks on GGF infrastructure
- >20% drop in FPIC Satisfaction Index
- Autonomous technology violations
- Mental health/social division crises

**Process:**
1. **TCRU** diagnoses and contains incidents
2. **Shield Protocol's GETF** pursues attackers
3. **Community-Led Resilience** activates local backups
4. Public incident reporting within 24 hours

---
