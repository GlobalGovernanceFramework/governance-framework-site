# **Appendix H: Tech Crisis Response Unit**

*Technology Governance Implementation Framework (TGIF) v3.2*

---

## **Overview & Mandate**

The **Tech Crisis Response Unit (TCRU)** serves as the Technology Governance Implementation Framework's specialized rapid-response capability for handling cybersecurity breaches, non-existential AI incidents, autonomous technology violations, and other technology-related emergencies. Operating under the Global Technology Council's authority, the TCRU provides the critical bridge between immediate crisis containment and comprehensive investigation through coordination with the Shield Protocol's Global Enforcement Task Force.

**Core Mission**: Provide 24/7 rapid response to technology crises affecting GGF infrastructure, community safety, or democratic governance while maintaining ethical standards and ensuring seamless handoff to specialized enforcement agencies.

**Operational Scope**: The TCRU handles **Tier 1-3** technology crises as defined by the Technology Risk & Responsibility Tiering (TRRT) system, while **Tier 0** existential threats escalate directly to the Planetary Immune System and Shield Protocol coordination.
