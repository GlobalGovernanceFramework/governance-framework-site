# **Appendix E: Technology Risk & Responsibility Tiering System (TRRT)**

*Technology Governance Implementation Framework (TGIF) Version 3.2*

---

## **Overview: Scalable Governance from Local Apps to Frontier AI**

The Technology Risk & Responsibility Tiering (TRRT) system provides a **scalable governance framework** that matches oversight intensity to technology risk and impact. Rather than applying one-size-fits-all governance, TRRT ensures that:

- **Low-risk local technologies** get lightweight, community-focused oversight
- **Medium-risk regional technologies** receive cross-community coordination
- **High-risk global technologies** undergo comprehensive multi-stakeholder review
- **Frontier technologies** are handed to specialized frameworks with deep expertise

## **1. Tier Classification Overview**

| Tier | Risk Level | Geographic Scope | Example Technologies | Governance Body | Review Frequency |
|------|------------|------------------|---------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| **Tier 1** | Local/Low-Risk | Single BAZ/Community | Community apps, local sensors, basic tools | Community Tech Review Board | Annual |
| **Tier 2** | Regional/Medium-Risk | Multi-BAZ/Regional | Bioregional platforms, cross-community systems | Regional Tech Council + GTC Standards | Quarterly |
| **Tier 3** | Global/Systemic-Risk | Multi-regional/Global | Social media, search engines, e-commerce | Full GTC Review + Public Process | Monthly |
