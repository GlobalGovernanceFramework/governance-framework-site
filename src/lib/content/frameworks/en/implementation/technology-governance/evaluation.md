*How do we know if technology governance is actually working for communities, or just creating the appearance of accountability while perpetuating harm?*

Traditional technology governance metrics focus on compliance, efficiency, and economic impact—often missing whether governance actually serves community well-being, ecological health, and Indigenous sovereignty. This framework measures success through community-defined indicators, long-term relationship health, and the absence of harm alongside positive outcomes.

## <a id="redefining-success"></a>Redefining Success in Technology Governance

*What does technology governance success look like when measured by community flourishing rather than corporate profits?*

### **Beyond Compliance to Community Thriving**

Success in technology governance isn't just about whether organizations follow rules—it's about whether governance creates conditions for communities to thrive, ecosystems to regenerate, and future generations to inherit a world enhanced rather than degraded by technology.

**Community-Defined Success Indicators**:
- **Cultural Vitality**: Technology supports rather than undermines language preservation, ceremonial practices, and traditional knowledge transmission
- **Ecological Relationship**: Technology enhances rather than disrupts human-Earth relationships and traditional ecological practices
- **Youth Empowerment**: Young people feel agency over their technological future rather than being passive consumers of imposed systems
- **Elder Wisdom Integration**: Traditional knowledge holders see their wisdom honored and protected in technology decisions

***Example in Action:*** *A region implemented new agricultural AI systems over three years. Traditional compliance metrics showed 98% adoption and 15% yield increases. However, community-defined success metrics revealed concerning patterns: Indigenous seed-saving practices declined by 40%, youth increasingly disconnected from traditional farming knowledge, and soil health degraded despite higher yields. This led to governance modifications prioritizing traditional knowledge integration and community-controlled technology adaptation.*

### **Long-Term Relationship Health**

**Seven-Generation Thinking in Evaluation**: Technology governance success is measured across Indigenous seven-generation timescales (approximately 140-200 years), assessing whether current decisions support or undermine long-term community and ecological well-being.

**Relational Accountability Metrics**: Rather than just measuring individual outcomes, evaluation focuses on relationship health between:
- **Human-Technology Relationships**: Whether technology enhances human agency and dignity
- **Community-Governance Relationships**: Whether communities trust governance processes and feel heard
- **Technology-Ecology Relationships**: Whether technological systems support ecological regeneration
- **Present-Future Relationships**: Whether current technology decisions serve future generations

## <a id="quantitative-metrics"></a>Quantitative Metrics: Numbers with Purpose
