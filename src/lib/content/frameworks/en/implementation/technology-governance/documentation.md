# Appendix K: Documentation & Evaluation Framework

## K.1 Overview: Living Documentation for Democratic Technology Governance

The Documentation & Evaluation Framework ensures that the Technology Governance Implementation Framework (TGIF) remains transparent, accountable, and continuously improving through comprehensive documentation standards and participatory evaluation methodologies. This framework recognizes that effective technology governance requires not just good policies, but also accessible documentation, meaningful community participation in evaluation, and adaptive learning systems that evolve with both technological and social change.

**Core Philosophy**: Documentation serves democracy—making technology governance transparent, accessible, and accountable to the communities it serves. Evaluation serves justice—ensuring governance systems actually deliver on their promises while respecting cultural diversity and Indigenous sovereignty.
