*How do we govern technology at global scale while ensuring it serves human values, respects community sovereignty, and prevents technological harm?*

The Global Technology Council (GTC) represents humanity's answer to this challenge—a governance body designed to operate at the speed of innovation while ensuring diverse voices shape our technological future. More than just another expert panel, the GTC embeds democracy, Indigenous wisdom, and community sovereignty into the heart of global technology governance.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview and Mission

*What would it look like if technology governance truly served all communities rather than just powerful corporations and wealthy nations?*

### **Core Mission**

The Global Technology Council exists to ensure that technology development and deployment serves human flourishing, ecological integrity, and community self-determination. Rather than reactive regulation that always lags behind innovation, the GTC provides adaptive governance that evolves alongside technology while keeping human values at the center.

***Example in Action:*** *When the first city-wide autonomous vehicle system was proposed for deployment, traditional regulatory bodies would have spent years developing rules while the technology rolled out uncontrolled. Instead, the GTC's Community Tech Review Boards worked with residents to develop real-time safety protocols, Indigenous communities ensured the system respected sacred sites and walking paths, and youth delegates required long-term environmental impact commitments—all coordinated and implemented within months.*

**Primary Functions**:
- Develop and maintain universal technology governance standards
- Coordinate technology governance across specialized frameworks
- Provide crisis response leadership for technological emergencies
- Ensure democratic participation in global technology decisions
- Protect community sovereignty and Indigenous rights in technology governance

**Guiding Vision**: Technology governance that operates at the speed of innovation while ensuring human values guide technological development, diverse communities meaningfully shape technology decisions, and governance evolves as thoughtfully as the technologies it oversees.

### **Relationship to Meta-Governance**

**Meta-Governance Integration**: The GTC operates as a specialized council within the Meta-Governance Coordination Council (MGCC) architecture:
- Reports to MGCC on technology governance coordination with other domains
- Participates in cross-domain crisis response through Meta-Governance crisis protocols
- Aligns technology governance with broader GGF principles and coordination mechanisms
- Contributes to system-wide reflexivity and learning processes

**Coordination Authority**: While maintaining autonomy over technology-specific decisions, the GTC coordinates with other Meta-Governance councils to ensure technology governance supports rather than conflicts with ecological, economic, and social governance priorities.

### **Operating Principles**

**Adaptive Governance**: The GTC operates as a learning organization, continuously evolving its approaches based on technological development, implementation experience, and community feedback.

**Polycentric Coordination**: Rather than centralized control, the GTC facilitates coordination among diverse technology governance actors while respecting their autonomy and cultural contexts.

**Transparent Authority**: All GTC decisions are publicly documented with clear rationales, community input integration, and impact assessment, maintaining accountability to affected communities.

**Precautionary Wisdom**: When facing uncertain risks, the GTC applies precautionary principles while supporting beneficial innovation through risk-proportionate governance approaches.

## <a id="composition"></a>Council Composition and Representation

*How do we balance technical expertise with democratic legitimacy—ensuring the GTC can understand complex technologies while remaining accountable to affected communities?*

The GTC's composition represents a radical departure from expert-only governance bodies. Every seat is designed to bring both competence and community accountability to technology decisions that affect billions of lives.

### **Core Council Structure**

The GTC maintains a carefully balanced composition ensuring both technical expertise and democratic representation:

## <a id="decision-making"></a>Decision-Making Processes

*How do we make technology governance decisions that are both technically sound and democratically legitimate?*

The GTC's decision-making processes reflect its core belief: those most affected by technology should have meaningful authority over technology decisions, while maintaining the technical expertise necessary for effective governance.

### **Transparent and Inclusive Procedures**

**Public Documentation Requirements**:
Every GTC decision becomes part of the permanent public record within 24 hours, with clear explanations of reasoning, community input integration, and dissenting opinions. This isn't just transparency—it's radical accountability to the communities technology affects.

***Example in Action:*** *When the GTC debated whether to approve a new facial recognition system for public spaces, the Public Trust Dashboard showed real-time community input from 127 affected neighborhoods. The final decision to require "privacy by design" modifications reflected specific concerns from disability rights advocates about discriminatory algorithms and Indigenous communities about surveillance of sacred gatherings. Every voice that influenced the decision was publicly documented.*

### **Decision Authority and Thresholds**

**Standard Decision Process (Simple Majority)**:
For routine governance decisions that don't significantly impact community sovereignty—technology tier classifications, resource allocation within budgets, inter-framework coordination.

**High-Stakes Decision Process (Double Majority)**:
When decisions could reshape entire technological domains or affect future generations, the GTC requires both technical expertise and youth validation:
- **Full Council Majority**: 16 of 30 GTC members (simple majority)
- **Youth Delegate Approval**: 2 of 3 youth delegates (super-majority)
- **Community Validation**: No formal community objections during 72-hour comment period

***Example in Action:*** *A major tech corporation proposed releasing an advanced AI system claiming it was "completely safe." The GTC's technical experts, impressed by the safety testing, voted 18-12 in favor. However, the Youth Delegates, concerned about irreversible impacts on how their generation would relate to technology, voted 3-0 against approval. This triggered the Double Majority rule, automatically requiring a one-year precautionary review with mandatory community input from digital natives worldwide.*

### **Emergency and Crisis Decision-Making**

**Crisis Governance Authority**:
- **Immediate Response** (6 hours): Individual GTC members can trigger crisis protocols for cybersecurity incidents or technology emergencies
- **Crisis Continuation** (72 hours): Simple majority required to continue crisis governance beyond initial response

**Emergency Safeguards**:
- All crisis decisions automatically expire after specified periods unless explicitly renewed
- Community impact monitoring required throughout crisis governance periods
- Emergency decisions subject to post-crisis review and community validation
- Crisis governance cannot override fundamental community sovereignty rights

### **Cultural and Conflict Resolution**

**Cultural Decision-Making Integration**:
- Traditional consensus methods available for Indigenous representatives when culturally appropriate
- Ceremonial opening and closing of major decision-making sessions respecting diverse spiritual traditions
- Seasonal and lunar calendar considerations for decision timing when requested by Indigenous representatives
