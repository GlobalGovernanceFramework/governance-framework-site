- **NO** → Continue to harm assessment

#### **Is there immediate harm to people?**
- **YES** → Immediate pause of technology, notify affected communities within 2 hours
- **NO** → Continue to risk assessment

#### **Could this cause irreversible damage?**
- **YES** → Implement precautionary pause, convene emergency stakeholder consultation within 24 hours
- **NO** → Use standard governance process with expedited timeline

#### **Is community consent threatened?**
- **YES** → Halt deployment, restart with proper FPIC process
- **NO** → Monitor closely, increase community consultation frequency

### **Cybersecurity Incident Response**

#### **Detection & Initial Response (0-2 hours)**
- **Identify threat**: Use automated monitoring and community reports
