# Glossary: Essential Terms for Data Sovereignty

> *"Words carry the spirit of our intentions. When we say 'data sovereignty' instead of 'data protection,' when we speak of 'sacred trust' rather than 'user agreements,' when we choose 'community control' over 'stakeholder engagement'—we transform not just language but the very foundation of how power flows in the digital age."*

*Language shapes reality. When Amara, the Kenyan farmer, opens her "consent dashboard" instead of clicking "I agree" to incomprehensible terms of service, she exercises meaningful choice rather than performative consent. When the Sámi Parliament asserts "data sovereignty" over traditional territory information rather than accepting "consultation" on external research, they claim authority rather than influence. When young people demand "intergenerational impact assessment" instead of hoping adults will consider their futures, they exercise democratic power rather than moral suasion. This glossary provides the conceptual vocabulary for transformation from data extraction to data sovereignty.*

## <a id="core-framework-terms"></a>Core Framework Terms

### **Aurora Accord**
The binding international agreement establishing global data governance under Treaty for Our Only Home authority. Named for the natural phenomenon that illuminates polar skies through interaction of solar winds and Earth's magnetic field, symbolizing how diverse human knowledge systems can interact to create beauty, understanding, and planetary protection.

### **Data as Sacred Trust**
The framework's foundational principle treating data as a reflection of individual lives, community wisdom, and planetary health requiring stewardship rather than extraction. Transforms data from commodity to be mined into relationship to be honored.

### **Data Sovereignty** 
The authority of individuals, communities, and Indigenous peoples to control collection, ownership, and application of data about them. Goes beyond privacy protection to encompass democratic control over how information shapes power relations and resource distribution.

### **Indigenous Data Sovereignty**
The inherent right and responsibility of Indigenous peoples to control data about their communities, territories, and resources. Recognized as supreme authority over traditional knowledge and cultural data, with absolute veto power over external use. Distinguished from general data sovereignty by recognizing Indigenous peoples' unique relationship to traditional knowledge and territorial data.

### **Polycrisis**
The interconnected failures in climate, economic, and political systems that create cascading global challenges requiring coordinated response. Data governance is both symptom and potential solution to polycrisis through its role in information systems that either accelerate extraction or enable regeneration.

### **Public Interest Override**
Limited circumstances requiring data retention for critical societal needs despite individual deletion rights. Determined by Digital Justice Tribunal using transparent, precedent-based criteria with community input and independent ethical review. Examples include war crimes evidence, public health imperatives during declared emergencies.
