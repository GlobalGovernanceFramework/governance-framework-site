## 4.2 Inclusive Decision-Making

The framework prioritizes inclusive governance through mechanisms that ensure all affected beings—human and non-human—have appropriate representation in decisions that impact their rights and wellbeing.

Key inclusive decision-making approaches include:

- **Citizen Assemblies**: Deliberative bodies composed of randomly selected individuals who consider complex rights issues and make recommendations to formal governance institutions. These assemblies are supported with educational resources and expert testimony to facilitate informed deliberation.

- **Stratified Random Selection**: Participant selection methods that ensure demographic representativeness across age, gender, socioeconomic status, geographic location, and cultural background.

- **Youth and Elder Representation**: Guaranteed participation of both younger and older generations to ensure intergenerational perspectives are incorporated into rights governance.

- **Accessibility Mandate**: All participation mechanisms must include accommodations for linguistic, economic, and ability-based barriers to ensure marginalized communities can meaningfully engage in decision-making processes.

- **Non-Human Representation**: Specialized protocols for incorporating the interests of non-human rights-holders through scientific assessment, cultural knowledge, and designated guardians who can advocate on their behalf.

These inclusive governance mechanisms recognize that ethical decision-making requires diverse perspectives and direct participation from those most affected by outcomes.
