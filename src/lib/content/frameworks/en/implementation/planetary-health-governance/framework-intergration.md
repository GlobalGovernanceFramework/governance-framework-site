*In healthy ecosystems, different species don't compete for dominance but find complementary niches that serve the flourishing of the whole. The mycorrhizal networks that connect forest trees don't control the forest but enable communication and resource sharing that makes the entire ecosystem more resilient. Planetary health governance operates similarly within the broader ecosystem of global governance frameworks—serving as the ethical compass and integrative wisdom that helps specialized systems work together for the health of our planetary home rather than competing against each other.*

## <a id="ethical-compass"></a>Planetary Health as Ethical Compass

The Planetary Health Governance Framework serves as the ethical compass for the entire Global Governance Framework ecosystem, providing moral guidance and systems integration that ensures all governance innovations serve the health of the whole rather than narrow interests.

---

The integration of the Planetary Health Governance Framework with other specialized frameworks creates a coherent, comprehensive system for global cooperation that serves the health of our planetary home while respecting the autonomy and expertise of different domains and cultures.

This integration is not merger or absorption but collaboration between complementary systems that each contribute their unique strengths to the shared goal of planetary health and human flourishing. Like the organs of a healthy body or the species in a thriving ecosystem, these frameworks work together while maintaining their distinct identities and functions.

The success of framework integration depends on maintaining the understanding that planetary health is the foundation for all other goals—that economic prosperity, technological innovation, democratic governance, and international cooperation all depend on the health of the living systems that sustain all life. When this understanding guides integration, frameworks strengthen each other in service of our shared planetary home.

**Next**: [Implementation Roadmap](/frameworks/planetary-health-governance#implementation-roadmap) - The strategic pathway for transforming vision into reality through carefully phased implementation that builds capacity while delivering immediate benefits to communities worldwide.
