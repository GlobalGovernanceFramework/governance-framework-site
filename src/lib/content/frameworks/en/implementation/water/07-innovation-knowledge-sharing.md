Innovation for water justice must break free from extractive models that appropriate community knowledge while creating technological dependencies. This section outlines innovation approaches that strengthen community autonomy, protect traditional knowledge, and democratize access to transformative technologies. By centering Indigenous wisdom while supporting collaborative development, these strategies ensure innovation serves liberation rather than exploitation while fostering global solidarity among water stewards.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Current innovation systems often extract knowledge from communities while concentrating benefits in wealthy institutions and corporations. Patents, proprietary technologies, and research colonialism prevent the most affected communities from controlling the innovations they need most. Transformative innovation must redistribute power over knowledge creation and technology development while respecting traditional knowledge systems that have sustained communities for millennia.

This framework establishes innovation systems that prioritize community ownership, protect Indigenous intellectual property, and democratize access to transformative technologies through open source development and collaborative networks. Rather than imposing external solutions, it supports community-led innovation while facilitating knowledge sharing that strengthens rather than undermines local autonomy.

**Core Innovation Principles**:
- **Community Ownership**: Local control over innovation priorities and intellectual property
- **Traditional Knowledge Respect**: Indigenous knowledge as equal partner with scientific innovation
- **Open Source Collaboration**: Shared development that prevents technological appropriation
- **Innovation Justice**: Technology serving the most marginalized communities first
- **Collaborative Development**: Global cooperation that strengthens rather than undermines local autonomy
