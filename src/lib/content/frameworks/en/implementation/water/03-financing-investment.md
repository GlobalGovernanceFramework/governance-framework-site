Transformative water financing must break free from extractive models that treat water as commodity and communities as consumers. This section outlines financing approaches that build community wealth, support ecosystem regeneration, and ensure universal access through innovative mechanisms that prioritize equity over profit. By centering public and cooperative ownership while harnessing market tools for justice, these financing strategies enable the massive investments required for water transformation while strengthening rather than undermining democratic control.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Current water financing failures reflect broader economic systems that prioritize short-term profits over long-term sustainability and community wellbeing. Market-based approaches consistently fail to reach the poorest populations while creating financial burdens that undermine human rights realization. Transformative financing requires fundamentally different approaches that build community ownership, support ecosystem restoration, and ensure affordability for all.

This financing framework combines robust public investment, innovative cooperative models, and carefully designed market mechanisms that serve justice rather than extraction. It recognizes that adequate water financing requires approximately $114 billion annually in additional investments globally, while ensuring these investments build community power rather than creating new dependencies.

**Core Financing Principles**:
- **Public and Cooperative Control**: Democratic ownership rather than private extraction
- **Affordability Guarantee**: Progressive pricing that ensures universal access regardless of income
- **Community Wealth Building**: Investments that strengthen local economies and ownership
- **Ecosystem Investment**: Financing that restores rather than degrades natural systems
- **Global Solidarity**: Resource transfers from wealthy to vulnerable communities and nations

## <a id="funding-sources-models"></a>Funding Sources & Models

### **Public Investment Foundations**

**National Budget Allocation**: Establish water and sanitation as budget priorities through constitutional requirements for minimum spending percentages, protected budget lines that cannot be reduced during austerity, and performance-based allocation that rewards equity outcomes over efficiency metrics alone.

**Progressive Taxation for Water**: Implement tax policies that generate water investment revenue through wealth taxes, carbon pricing, financial transaction taxes, and luxury consumption taxes while ensuring water investments benefit contributors through improved services and ecosystem health.

**Municipal Finance Innovation**: Strengthen local government capacity for water investment through improved revenue collection, land value capture mechanisms, municipal bond markets with community participation, and intergovernmental transfer systems that support rather than undermine local autonomy.

**Case Study (Real)**: Ghana's implementation of the National Health Insurance Levy demonstrates how dedicated taxes can fund universal service provision. The levy, applied to VAT and petroleum products, generates sustainable revenue for health services while maintaining political support through visible service improvements.

### **Sovereign Investment Mechanisms**

**WASH Sovereign Wealth Funds**: Establish national wealth funds dedicated to water infrastructure using models adapted from Norway's oil fund, with democratic governance, transparent investment policies, and intergenerational protection against political interference.

**Sovereign WASH Innovation Funds**: Create national investment vehicles for water technology development, community ownership support, and ecosystem restoration with patient capital approaches that prioritize social and environmental returns alongside financial sustainability.

**Regional Cooperation Funds**: Develop multinational investment mechanisms for transboundary water cooperation, shared infrastructure development, and climate adaptation with governance structures that ensure equitable benefit-sharing and community participation.

**Implementation Framework**:
- **Democratic Governance**: Community representation on fund boards with Indigenous peoples and marginalized communities having guaranteed seats
- **Investment Criteria**: Environmental and social impact requirements, community ownership preferences, and additionality standards that ensure funds complement rather than replace other investment
- **Transparency Standards**: Public disclosure of all investments, performance metrics, and decision-making processes with community oversight mechanisms
- **Sustainability Requirements**: Long-term revenue generation strategies that do not depend on resource extraction or ecosystem exploitation

### **Development Finance Transformation**

**Multilateral Development Bank Reform**: Transform World Bank and regional development bank approaches through governance reforms that increase borrower country representation, policy conditionality elimination that prioritizes community ownership over privatization, and grant financing increase for lowest-income countries.

**South-South Finance Expansion**: Strengthen financial cooperation among developing countries through regional development banks, South-South loan facilities, technical assistance exchanges, and shared infrastructure investment approaches that reduce dependency on traditional donors.

**Debt Justice Integration**: Address unsustainable debt burdens that prevent water investment through debt cancellation campaigns, debt-for-nature swaps, audit processes that identify illegitimate debts, and reformed lending practices that prioritize grant financing for essential services.

**Case Study (Real)**: The Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank has demonstrated alternative approaches to development finance through streamlined procedures, reduced conditionality, and increased borrower country representation. However, stronger environmental and social standards and community participation mechanisms are needed for truly transformative impact.
