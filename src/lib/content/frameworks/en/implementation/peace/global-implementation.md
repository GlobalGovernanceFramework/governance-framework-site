**Implementation Support Resources:**

To bridge theory and practice, this framework is accompanied by a **Peace & Conflict Resolution Seed Kit** - a comprehensive package containing essential tools for immediate implementation. The kit includes conflict analysis templates, local peace committee charters, early warning protocols, dialogue facilitation guides, and regionally-adaptable resources. This practical starting point enables peace practitioners to rapidly deploy evidence-based approaches while maintaining alignment with the broader governance framework. Access the complete Seed Kit and additional implementation tools through the [Tools Library](/frameworks/tools/peace).

### Global Conflict Resolution Implementation (Planetary Scale)
- **Global Peace Infrastructure**: Institutions and mechanisms for preventing and resolving conflicts that transcend regional boundaries
- **Global Arms Governance**: Frameworks for reducing weapons proliferation and regulating emerging military technologies
- **Peace Technology Standards**: Ethical guidelines for technology in conflict prevention and resolution
- **Global Justice Mechanisms**: Systems for addressing international crimes and providing redress to victims

**Implementation Tools**:
- Models for global early warning and preventive diplomacy
- Frameworks for technology-enabled peacekeeping and civilian protection
- Standards for humanitarian intervention and responsibility to protect
- Templates for international mediation protocols
- Global conflict analysis frameworks
- Interoperability standards for peace and security organizations

**Case Study**: The International Criminal Court (ICC), despite limitations, represents an attempt to create global accountability for serious international crimes. By establishing individual criminal responsibility for genocide, crimes against humanity, and war crimes, the ICC has shifted international norms and demonstrated that even high-ranking officials may face consequences for atrocities. The Court's complementarity principle—operating only when national courts are unwilling or unable to prosecute—creates incentives for states to improve their domestic justice systems while providing recourse when they fail.
