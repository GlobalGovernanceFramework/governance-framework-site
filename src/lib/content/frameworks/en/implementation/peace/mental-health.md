### Mental Health & Psychosocial Support

The *Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework* recognizes mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) as essential for sustainable peace, addressing individual, collective, and intergenerational trauma to foster resilience, reconciliation, and social cohesion. Integrating behavioral psychology, cultural sensitivity, and trauma-informed approaches, this section outlines strategies to embed MHPSS in peacebuilding, aligned with SDG 16 (Peace, Justice and Strong Institutions), UNDP peacebuilding principles, and OSCE conflict prevention protocols (see [Core Peace & Conflict Resolution Principles](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#core-principles)).

#### 1. Trauma-Informed Peace Processes
- **Description**: Design peace initiatives that prioritize psychological well-being, avoid re-traumatization, and integrate healing into governance, ensuring inclusivity and cultural resonance.
- **Strategies**:
  - Conduct *Psychological Impact Assessments* to evaluate how peace processes (e.g., mediations, truth commissions) affect mental health, informing adaptive strategies.
  - Implement *Trauma-Sensitive Dialogue* methodologies, using Nonviolent Communication (NVC) to foster empathetic, non-judgmental exchanges (see [Local Conflict Resolution Implementation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#local-implementation)).
  - Promote *Healing-Centered Engagement*, focusing on well-being and community strengths rather than solely conflict resolution, as seen in Rwanda’s community-based approaches.
  - Incorporate *Mental Health Diplomacy* in official peace negotiations, including provisions for psychological recovery in peace agreements (see [Transitional Justice & Reconciliation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#transitional-justice)).
- **Application**: Use in multi-track dialogues to ensure mediators address trauma, as piloted in Colombia’s 2016 peace process with FARC.

#### 2. Community-Based Psychosocial Support
- **Description**: Deliver culturally resonant MHPSS through local resources, strengthening community capacities to address shared and individual trauma in fragile and post-conflict contexts (see [Context-Specific Implementation Roadmaps](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#context-specific-roadmaps)).
- **Strategies**:
  - Train *Community Health Workers* and local healers in trauma-informed care, using non-digital methods like storytelling and rituals for low-literacy groups.
  - Establish *Safe Spaces* for dialogue and healing, modeled on Liberia’s Women’s Peace Huts, to foster trust and peer support.
  - Build *Peer Support Networks* to connect conflict-affected individuals, facilitating collective recovery through shared experiences.
  - Implement *Resilience-Building Programs* to strengthen psychological coping capacities, integrating local cultural practices for accessibility.
- **Case Study**: South Sudan’s community healing circles (2018–2023) combined local rituals with facilitated group sessions, reducing community tensions by 25% and enhancing social cohesion.

#### 3. Collective Trauma Healing & Generational Memory
- **Description**: Address collective trauma and intergenerational memory through community-wide healing processes and truth-telling mechanisms, fostering trust and preventing trauma transmission (see [Transitional Justice & Reconciliation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#transitional-justice)).
- **Strategies**:
  - Implement *Community Truth-Telling Forums* to share narratives of past conflicts, using *Value System Mapping* to bridge cultural divides (see [Developmental Value Systems & Peace](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#developmental-value-systems)).
  - Develop *Healing-Oriented Memorialization* projects, such as memorials or oral history archives, to honor generational memory without rekindling divisions.
  - Engage youth in *Intergenerational Dialogue Programs* to process inherited trauma and build cooperative futures, as piloted in Northern Ireland.
  - Promote *Cross-Cultural Healing Approaches* to respect diverse understandings of trauma, combining indigenous and modern practices.
- **Case Study**: Rwanda’s post-genocide MHPSS initiatives, including *Ingando* solidarity camps and community-based sociotherapy, facilitated collective healing for over 120,000 participants. By integrating truth-telling, cultural rituals, and group sessions led by trained community facilitators, these programs processed 1.9 million cases, improved mental health, and strengthened conflict management capacities.

#### 4. Trauma Resilience in Digital Spaces
- **Description**: Mitigate trauma from exposure to online war content, trolling, and peacebuilder burnout, ensuring digital peacebuilding supports mental health (see [AI & Digital Peace Ethics](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#ai-ethics)).
- **Strategies**:
  - Deploy *Digital Safe Spaces* with moderated online forums to protect users from hate speech and graphic content, using real-time content moderation (see [Digital Peace Infrastructure](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#digital-infrastructure)).
  - Offer *Digital Literacy Workshops* to teach coping strategies for online trauma, including recognizing trolling and deepfakes, as implemented in Ukraine’s digital campaigns.
  - Provide *Burnout Prevention Training* for peacebuilders, including mindfulness, peer support, and time management, tailored for those managing online conflict data.
- **Case Study**: Myanmar’s 2017–2025 digital trauma response trained activists to manage exposure to hate speech on social media, reducing burnout through peer networks and digital literacy programs.

#### 5. Integrated Mental Health Systems
- **Description**: Embed MHPSS in peace governance, addressing psychological and material needs to break cycles of trauma and support long-term resilience.
- **Strategies**:
  - Include *Mental Health Provisions* in peace agreements, ensuring funding and infrastructure for psychological recovery, as seen in Sierra Leone’s post-conflict recovery.
  - Integrate *Mental Health and Economic Recovery* programs, combining psychosocial support with livelihood opportunities to address holistic needs.
  - Implement *Intergenerational Trauma Prevention* initiatives, such as family-based counseling and youth engagement, to disrupt trauma cycles.
  - Use *Psychosocial Metrics* to track community resilience, integrated with peace governance indicators (see [Measuring Peace Governance Success](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#measuring-success)).
- **Application**: Align with *Restorative Justice Mechanisms* to support healing during truth commissions and reparations, enhancing trust-building.

#### 6. Integration with Peace Processes
- **Description**: Ensure MHPSS is a core component of all peacebuilding activities, from mediation to policy design, to create trauma-informed governance.
- **Strategies**:
  - Train mediators in *Nonviolent Communication (NVC)* and trauma-informed techniques to facilitate inclusive, empathetic dialogues.
  - Embed MHPSS in *Local Peace Committees* and *Regional Peace Hubs* to address trauma at multiple scales (see [Local Conflict Resolution Implementation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#local-implementation)).
  - Align with *Peace Financing* strategies to secure funding for MHPSS programs, such as community-based sociotherapy (see [Peace Financing & Resource Mobilization](/frameworks/docs/implementation/peace#peace-financing)).

**Implementation Tools**:
- *[Trauma-Informed Facilitation Toolkit](/frameworks/tools/peace/trauma-informed-toolkit-en.pdf)*: Guide facilitators in NVC, trauma-informed mediation, and cultural nuance.
- *[Community Healing Protocol](/frameworks/tools/peace/community-healing-protocol-en.pdf)*: Structure truth-telling and memorialization.
- *[Digital Safe Space Guide](/frameworks/tools/peace/digital-safe-space-guide-en.pdf)*: Design moderated online forums.
- *[Mental Health Diplomacy Framework](/frameworks/tools/peace/mental-health-diplomacy-framework-en.pdf)*: Integrate psychological recovery into peace negotiations.
- *[Value System Mapping Template](/frameworks/tools/peace/value-system-mapping-template-en.pdf)*: Ensure cultural resonance in healing.
- *[Paper-Based Dialogue Template](/frameworks/tools/peace/paper-dialogue-template-en.pdf)*: Support low-literacy communities.

These tools are included in the *Peace & Conflict Resolution Seed Kit*, accessible via the [Tools Library](/frameworks/tools/peace).

**Equity Commitment**: All MHPSS resources are open-access, with translations planned for Spanish, Arabic, and French. Non-digital tools (e.g., paper-based templates, radio scripts) and community-led approaches ensure accessibility for low-literacy and low-connectivity communities, prioritizing inclusion for marginalized groups (e.g., refugees, Indigenous populations).

**Call to Action**: Stakeholders can strengthen peacebuilding by embedding MHPSS in their initiatives. Start by training facilitators with the *Trauma-Informed Facilitation Toolkit*, establishing *Safe Spaces*, or advocating for mental health provisions in peace agreements.
