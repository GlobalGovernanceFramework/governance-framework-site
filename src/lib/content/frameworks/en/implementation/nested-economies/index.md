**Framework Development**: The Nested Economies Framework emerges from the urgent need to create economies of **Right Relationship** that balance local autonomy with global cooperation. Developed through iterative research integrating cooperative economics, commons theory, and blockchain interoperability, this framework offers practical tools for building equitable, regenerative, and culturally vibrant economic systems that serve all beings.

**Revision**: 1.0 (2025-07-06) - Enhanced with Community Weaver roles, Green Job Score integration, and Social Resilience Council mandate clarification

In a world where global economic integration often comes at the cost of local autonomy and cultural diversity, where communities lose control over their resources while distant markets determine their fate, the **Nested Economies Framework** offers a revolutionary approach to economic cooperationâ€”positioning **Right Relationship** as the foundation for systems that honor both local self-determination and planetary interdependence.

## <a id="introduction"></a>Introduction: Economics of Right Relationship

**The Challenge**: Current economic integration models force communities to choose between isolation and exploitation. The European Union prioritizes regulatory uniformity over local diversity. The WTO maximizes trade volumes while ignoring equity and sustainability. Degrowth movements risk economic stagnation. Doughnut Economics provides excellent boundaries but limited interoperability mechanisms. Meanwhile, communities worldwide lose economic sovereignty to distant markets and corporate extraction.

**The Opportunity**: For the first time in human history, we possess the technological tools and governance wisdom to create economic systems that grow stronger through everyone's flourishing rather than extracting wealth from communities. We can build nested systems where local autonomy and global cooperation reinforce rather than undermine each other, where cultural diversity becomes an economic asset, and where regenerative practices drive prosperity.

**The Framework**: The Nested Economies Framework creates comprehensive economic integration architecture through:

- **Hearts & Leaves Currency**: [Hearts](/frameworks/financial-systems#hearts-currency) reward care economy activities while [Leaves](/frameworks/financial-systems#leaves-currency) recognize ecological restoration, operating through the [Love Ledger platform](/frameworks/financial-systems#love-ledger)
- **Four-Layered AUBI**: [Adaptive Universal Basic Income](/frameworks/adaptive-universal-basic-income) providing universal baseline, contribution bonuses, equity adjustments, and global stabilization
- **Community Weavers**: Professional facilitators ensuring authentic participation and cultural adaptation across nested systems
- **Social Resilience Council**: [Meta-governance coordination body](/frameworks/meta-governance#coordination-councils) overseeing Hearts supply management and ethical oversight
- **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**: Holistic prosperity metrics replacing GDP's narrow focus on accumulation

This framework transforms economics from zero-sum competition into positive-sum collaboration, measured not by extraction but by the quality of relationships between individuals, communities, and the Earth.

### Framework Distinctions and Comparative Analysis

| Framework | Focus | Strength | Weakness | Our Innovation |
|-----------|-------|----------|----------|----------------|
| **European Union** | Regulatory harmonization | Economic unity, market access | Limits local autonomy, cultural standardization | **Hearts** currency preserves local sovereignty within cooperation |
| **WTO** | Global trade maximization | Market access, efficiency | Ignores equity, environmental costs | **Resource Justice** and **Proof of Care** center sustainability |

**Regional Level: Bioregional Resource Sharing**
- **Hearts**-based trade zones following watershed and ecosystem boundaries aligned with [bioregional governance principles](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#bioregional-governance)
- Currency networks enabling value exchange between communities while maintaining local control
- Regional development funds receiving 10% of **Hearts** trade revenue for redistribution to under-resourced communities
- Cross-boundary coordination for shared resources like water, energy, and transportation

**Global Level: Commons Governance and Stabilization**
- Fair trade standards managed by the **Global Commons Council** with [Treaty-backed enforcement](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#pillar-3-enforcement)

|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Care Acts | Proof of Care score Ã— impact multiplier (1-5x) | Community validation + **Love Ledger** verification |
| Ecological Work | Green Job Score Ã— AUBI **Leaves** multiplier | Scientific monitoring + Indigenous knowledge validation |
| Fiat Donations | 1:1 match via **Heartstarter** program | Transparent tracking + anti-money laundering compliance |
| Time Banks | Hours Ã— regional wage index Ã· global **Hearts** rate | Community hour banks + regional coordination |
| Carbon Credits | Tonnage Ã— eco-impact factor (IPCC-based) | Independent verification + community benefit assessment |

### Resource Justice and Anti-Exploitation

**Commons Management**: Water, land, and energy treated as commons with extraction caps 20% below ecological baselines by Year 5, co-designed with [Indigenous stewardship protocols](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#traditional-knowledge-protection)

## About This Framework

**Development Status**: The Nested Economies Framework represents comprehensive synthesis of cooperative economics, commons theory, and blockchain interoperability developed through iterative research and community consultation. It operates as economic integration infrastructure within the broader Global Governance Framework ecosystem, coordinating with Indigenous sovereignty, universal basic income, meta-governance, planetary health, and work organization frameworks.

**Revision History**: 
- **Version 2.1 (2025-07-06)**: Enhanced Community Weaver roles, Green Job Score integration, Social Resilience Council mandate clarification
- **Version 2.0 (2025-07-04)**: Embedded Hearts/Leaves currency systems, four-layered AUBI, Indigenous governance integration
- **Version 1.0 (2025-06-16)**: Initial framework with nested systems concepts and basic AUBI structure

**Living Document Status**: This framework is designed for continuous improvement based on pilot program outcomes, community feedback, and coordination with other framework developments. Regular updates planned based on implementation experience and cross-framework integration needs.

**Implementation Guidance**: The framework provides evidence-based guidance for economic integration transformation. Implementation should involve consultation with Indigenous knowledge keepers, cooperative development specialists, community economists, and local stakeholders familiar with cultural, legal, and economic contexts while maintaining coordination across the framework ecosystem.

**The Urgency of Economic Justice**: Current economic systems force communities to choose between isolation and exploitation while concentrating wealth among the few. Global challenges require cooperation, but existing integration models sacrifice local autonomy for efficiency. The Nested Economies Framework offers a pathway to economic systems that honor both local self-determination and planetary interdependence through **Right Relationship** principles.

**The Vision Within Reach**: Every community deserves economic sovereignty. Every culture deserves protection from economic colonization. Every person deserves prosperity measured by care, creativity, and connection rather than accumulation and competition. The tools exist through **Hearts** currency, **Love Ledger** infrastructure, and Community Weaver facilitation. The evidence supports transformation through cooperative economics and commons governance. What remains is collective courage to choose **Right Relationship** over extraction, cooperation over competition, and regenerative abundance over scarcity consciousness.

**It begins with community pilots and Indigenous leadership. It scales through bioregional cooperation and cultural sovereignty. It culminates in planetary economies that serve all life.**
