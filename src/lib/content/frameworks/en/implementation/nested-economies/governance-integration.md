*When Elena's East Oakland clinic receives Hearts payments for community healthcare, who decides how many Hearts constitute fair compensation? When Maya's watershed restoration project spans three counties with different environmental regulations, which governance body coordinates standards and funding? When Joseph's Anishinaabe community wants to trade traditional foods through Hearts currency while maintaining cultural protocols, how do economic systems accommodate ceremonial requirements and seasonal calendars? These questions reveal the complex integration needed between economic transformation and governance innovation.*

*Nested sovereignty requires sophisticated governance systems that ensure democratic participation while maintaining efficiency and accountability. Economic decisions cannot be separated from questions of power, culture, and justice. The framework provides comprehensive mechanisms for integrating economic transformation with democratic governance that serves Right Relationship rather than elite control.*

## <a id="economic-decision-protocols"></a>Economic Decision Protocols

Clear decision-making authority prevents conflicts while ensuring democratic accountability across nested economies's multiple levels:

### Decision Rights Matrix and Authority Distribution

**Local Level Economic Authority**: Communities maintain sovereign authority over Hearts currency allocation, contribution validation criteria, and local economic policies including minimum wage standards, business licensing requirements, and community investment priorities. Local assemblies vote on Hearts creation rates, establish contribution recognition protocols, and determine integration levels with regional networks through monthly participatory governance meetings achieving 80% community participation.

**Regional Level Coordination Authority**: Bioregional councils coordinate trade standards, resource sharing protocols, and infrastructure development while respecting community sovereignty over local economic decisions. Regional authority covers Hearts exchange rates between communities, solidarity fund distribution criteria, environmental standards for regional trade, and crisis response resource allocation. Bioregional councils operate through consensus processes with community veto authority over decisions affecting local sovereignty.

**Global Level Commons Governance**: The Global Commons Council manages planetary resources including atmosphere, oceans, and shared technology infrastructure while ensuring universal access to essential systems and crisis response coordination. Global authority covers [AUBI baseline parameters](/frameworks/adaptive-universal-basic-income#layer-1-universal), automation tax rates, global commons fund allocation, and planetary emergency response protocols. Global decisions require supermajority support with bioregional representation and Indigenous Earth Council veto authority.

**Indigenous Sovereignty Recognition**: [Indigenous Earth Council](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) maintains ultimate authority over decisions affecting traditional territories, cultural protocols, and traditional knowledge systems regardless of economic integration levels. Indigenous authority operates through traditional governance systems with Free, Prior, and Informed Consent protocols preventing economic systems from overriding cultural sovereignty or territorial rights.

### Currency Governance and Exchange Rate Determination

**Community-Controlled Hearts Creation**: Hearts currency creation operates through democratic community assemblies that vote on money supply adjustments, inflation targets, and contribution recognition criteria based on community economic health and participation levels. Money creation authority remains at community level preventing external manipulation of local currency supplies while enabling integration with regional networks.

**Regional Exchange Rate Coordination**: Hearts exchange rates between communities operate through transparent market mechanisms with community override authority when exchange rates threaten community economic stability or cultural integrity. Exchange rate coordination includes automatic stabilization mechanisms, community circuit breakers, and dispute resolution processes ensuring fair trade relationships between communities with different economic conditions.

**Global Stabilization Reserve Management**: Global reserves protect Hearts currencies during economic instability through asset backing, temporary trading halts, and emergency fiat bridges managed by the [Social Resilience Council](/frameworks/meta-governance#coordination-councils) with community representative governance and transparent decision-making processes. Reserve management operates through democratic oversight rather than technocratic authority ensuring stabilization serves community needs.

**Anti-Speculation and Wealth Concentration Limits**: Currency governance includes automatic mechanisms preventing speculation and wealth concentration including maximum accumulation limits, transaction taxes on large Holdings, and mandatory redistribution when concentration exceeds community-determined thresholds. Anti-speculation measures operate through algorithmic enforcement with community override authority ensuring economic systems serve community prosperity rather than individual accumulation.

### Economic Policy Integration and Coordination

**Participatory Economic Planning**: Community economic development operates through participatory planning processes that integrate individual preferences, community needs, ecological limits, and cultural values through structured deliberation and consensus-building. Economic planning includes production priorities, infrastructure investment, skills development, and trade relationships determined through democratic processes rather than market mechanisms or technocratic planning.

**Cross-Level Policy Harmonization**: Economic policies coordinate across local, regional, and global levels through consultation processes, impact assessment, and conflict resolution mechanisms that respect community sovereignty while enabling effective coordination. Policy harmonization includes environmental standards, labor protections, and anti-exploitation measures that strengthen rather than constrain community economic autonomy.

**Traditional Knowledge Integration**: Economic planning integrates traditional ecological knowledge, seasonal calendars, and cultural protocols through Indigenous leadership and traditional authority systems rather than extractive consultation processes. Traditional knowledge informs sustainable production methods, resource management practices, and community resilience strategies while remaining under community control and ongoing consent protocols.

**Youth and Future Generations Authority**: Economic decisions affecting future generations require consultation with youth councils and seven-generation impact assessment ensuring present economic choices serve long-term community and ecological health. Youth authority includes veto power over economically irreversible decisions and mandatory representation in economic planning processes affecting their future wellbeing and cultural inheritance.
