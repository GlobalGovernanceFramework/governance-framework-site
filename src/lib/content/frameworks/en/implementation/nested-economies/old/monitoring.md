Monitoring and Evaluation within the regenerative economy framework represents a fundamental transformation from colonial measurement systems to Indigenous-led assessment protocols that honor Traditional Ecological Knowledge and seven-generation accountability. This section details how communities implement the **Gross Planetary Health (GPH) Index**, Traditional Knowledge monitoring systems, and ceremonial governance evaluation to ensure economic transformation serves ecological restoration, cultural revitalization, and planetary healing. Grounded in the principles of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), [Indigenous Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and [Meta-Governance coordination](/frameworks/meta-governance), these protocols prioritize Indigenous sovereignty, ecological integrity, and intergenerational justice over colonial metrics and extractive accountability systems.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Monitoring and Evaluation serves as the accountability mechanism ensuring that economic transformation genuinely advances Indigenous sovereignty, ecological restoration, and planetary healing rather than perpetuating colonial extraction under new names. This framework replaces GDP and market-based success metrics with **Traditional Knowledge-guided indicators** that measure the health of relationships between humans, ecosystems, and future generations.

**Positioning within Golden Triangle**: This monitoring framework operationalizes the [Indigenous Governance Framework's GPH Index](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#gph-metrics), integrates the [Treaty's Global Monitoring Systems](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#monitoring-systems) for planetary accountability, and participates in the [Meta-Governance evaluation coordination](/frameworks/meta-governance#evaluation-framework) while maintaining Indigenous data sovereignty.

**Core Transformation**: Monitoring systems shift from:
- **From**: GDP growth and market indicators
- **To**: Gross Planetary Health and ecosystem vitality
- **From**: Quarterly profit reporting and shareholder value
- **To**: Seven-generation impact assessment and ancestor/descendant accountability
- **From**: Colonial data extraction and external evaluation
- **To**: Indigenous data sovereignty and community-controlled assessment
- **From**: Individual performance metrics and competitive rankings
- **To**: Relational health indicators and collective abundance measures

**Vision**: Establish monitoring systems where Traditional Knowledge holders guide all evaluation processes, ecosystems have legal standing in assessment protocols, and seven-generation thinking ensures decisions serve planetary and cultural healing across time scales.

## <a id="mechanisms"></a>Mechanisms

## <a id="case-study"></a>Case Study

**Māori Health and Development Indicators (Aotearoa New Zealand)**: The development of Māori-specific health and development indicators demonstrates successful Indigenous-led assessment that honors Traditional Knowledge while providing rigorous accountability for collective well-being. Beginning in the 1980s, Māori communities developed assessment frameworks based on traditional concepts like whakatōhea (collective identity), whakapapa (genealogical connections), and mauri (life force), replacing colonial individual-focused health metrics with relational and culturally-grounded indicators. These assessments guided policy decisions affecting Māori communities and influenced government resource allocation, demonstrating how Traditional Knowledge-based monitoring can achieve political effectiveness while maintaining cultural integrity. This case informs Traditional Knowledge monitoring approaches, emphasizing Indigenous authority over assessment design, cultural protocol integration, and the effectiveness of Traditional Knowledge indicators for guiding resource allocation, reflected in the GPH Calculator and Indigenous Well-Being Indicators Toolkit.
