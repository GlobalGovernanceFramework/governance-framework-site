Regional economic implementation serves as the critical bridge between Indigenous sovereignty and planetary healing within the Golden Triangle governance ecosystem. This section details how bioregional councils, watershed stewards, and Traditional Knowledge holders can establish Indigenous-led autonomous zones, regenerative economies, and ceremonial governance systems that restore human-Earth relationships while advancing economic justice. Grounded in the principles of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), [Indigenous Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and [Meta-Governance coordination](/frameworks/meta-governance), these mechanisms prioritize ecological restoration, cultural revitalization, and seven-generation accountability over extraction and accumulation.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Regional economic implementation operates as the transformative space where **Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)** emerge as models of Indigenous-led regenerative governance, replacing extractive colonial economies with Traditional Ecological Knowledge-guided stewardship. This framework centers Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Knowledge systems, and ceremonial governance as the foundation for all regional economic planning, implementing the regenerative economy vision of the Golden Triangle frameworks.

**Positioning within Golden Triangle**: This regional framework operationalizes the [Indigenous Governance Framework's Bioregional Autonomous Zones](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#bioregional-zones), integrates the [Treaty's Global Taxation Mechanisms](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#global-taxation) for regional funding, and participates in the [Economic Meta-Council coordination](/frameworks/meta-governance#economic-coordination) for cross-bioregional alignment.

**Vision**: Transform regions from centers of extraction and exploitation into **Bioregional Autonomous Zones** where Indigenous nations lead ecological restoration, Traditional Knowledge guides all economic decisions, and the **Gross Planetary Health (GPH) Index** replaces GDP as the measure of regional success.

**Core Transformation**: Regional economies shift from:
- **From**: Municipal competition and resource extraction
- **To**: Bioregional cooperation and ecological regeneration
- **From**: Market-driven development and private accumulation  
- **To**: Traditional Knowledge-guided stewardship and collective abundance
- **From**: GDP growth and industrial expansion
- **To**: GPH enhancement and cultural revitalization

## <a id="mechanisms"></a>Mechanisms

Regional implementation operates through Indigenous-led mechanisms that transform extractive economies into regenerative systems while establishing bioregional sovereignty and ecological restoration:

### Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)
- **Indigenous Sovereignty**: BAZs operate under Indigenous law and Traditional Ecological Knowledge, with [Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC 2.0)](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#fpic-protocols) protocols governing all external engagement.
- **Ecological Boundaries**: Regions organized around watersheds, food webs, and cultural territories rather than colonial political boundaries, implementing [bioregional stewardship principles](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#bioregional-governance).
- **Economic Sovereignty**: BAZs control resource extraction, trade relationships, and development patterns according to Traditional Knowledge and seven-generation planning.

### Regenerative Economy Implementation
- **GPH Index Adoption**: Replace GDP with **Gross Planetary Health metrics** measuring ecological restoration, cultural vitality, and community well-being through [Indigenous-designed indicators](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#gph-metrics).
- **Gift Economy Integration**: Implement reciprocity-based economics drawing from Traditional Knowledge systems, reducing monetary dependence and building community resilience.
- **Circular Resource Flows**: Establish zero-waste systems following traditional ecological principles, with all economic activity designed to enhance rather than degrade ecosystem health.

### Reparations and Land Rematriation
- **Ecological Reparations**: Corporate accountability mechanisms require ecological restoration funding from extractive industries, managed through Indigenous-led [ecological reparations protocols](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#reparations-framework).
- **Land Back Economics**: Economic frameworks explicitly support Indigenous land rematriation through [land trust mechanisms](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#land-rematriation) and legal sovereignty recognition.
