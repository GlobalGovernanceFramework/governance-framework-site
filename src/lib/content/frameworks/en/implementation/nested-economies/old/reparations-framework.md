The Reparations Framework represents the foundational economic justice mechanism of the regenerative economy, ensuring that ecological and colonial debts are repaid to Indigenous communities and frontline populations who have borne the costs of extractive capitalism while being excluded from its benefits. This framework details comprehensive reparations protocols that center Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and community-controlled restoration as the pathway to planetary healing and economic justice. Grounded in the principles of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), [Indigenous Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and [Meta-Governance coordination](/frameworks/meta-governance), these mechanisms prioritize accountability, restoration, and Indigenous leadership over charity, development aid, or market-based solutions that perpetuate colonial relationships.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The Reparations Framework positions reparations not as charity or assistance, but as **fundamental debt repayment** for centuries of ecological destruction and colonial extraction that have enriched Global North institutions while impoverishing Indigenous communities and the Earth itself. This framework transforms the global economy from extraction-based accumulation to restoration-based reciprocity through comprehensive accountability mechanisms.

**Positioning within Golden Triangle**: This reparations framework operationalizes the [Indigenous Governance Framework's Reparations for Regeneration](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#reparations-regeneration), utilizes the [Treaty's Global Taxation Mechanisms](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#global-taxation) for accountability funding, and coordinates through the [Meta-Governance Economic Council](/frameworks/meta-governance#economic-coordination) while maintaining Indigenous sovereignty over reparations allocation and implementation.

**Core Transformation**: Reparations framework shifts from:
- **From**: Development aid and charity models that maintain dependency
- **To**: Debt repayment and accountability that recognizes colonial extraction
- **From**: Individual compensation and welfare programs
- **To**: Collective restoration and Indigenous sovereignty strengthening
- **From**: Market-based solutions and carbon trading schemes
- **To**: Direct restoration funding and Traditional Knowledge implementation
- **From**: Government and NGO-controlled distribution
- **To**: Indigenous-controlled allocation and Traditional Knowledge-guided priorities

**Vision**: Establish reparations as the primary mechanism for global economic transformation, where colonial governments and extractive corporations repay ecological and colonial debts through Indigenous-controlled restoration funding that strengthens Traditional Knowledge systems, restores ecosystems, and builds Indigenous sovereignty.

**2050 Commitment**: $5 trillion in ecological and colonial reparations transferred to Indigenous-controlled institutions, 80% of critical ecosystems under Indigenous restoration management, and 100% of extractive industries operating under Indigenous consent and accountability protocols.

## <a id="ecological-reparations-mechanisms"></a>Ecological Reparations Mechanisms

Ecological reparations address the massive ecological debt created by industrial capitalism, climate change, and environmental racism, requiring comprehensive restoration funding controlled by Indigenous communities and frontline populations who possess the Traditional Knowledge necessary for planetary healing.

### Ecological Debt Calculation
- **Carbon Debt Assessment**: Comprehensive calculation of historical carbon emissions by nation and corporation, with reparations funding proportional to cumulative emissions and ecological damage through [carbon debt protocols](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#carbon-debt-calculation).
- **Biodiversity Loss Accounting**: Assessment of biodiversity destruction by extractive industries, with restoration funding calculated based on ecosystem service loss and Traditional Knowledge restoration requirements through [biodiversity debt assessment](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#biodiversity-debt).
- **Pollution Liability Evaluation**: Comprehensive accounting of air, water, and soil contamination by industrial activities, with cleanup and restoration funding calculated through Traditional Knowledge environmental assessment methods.

### Indigenous-Led Restoration Funding
- **Traditional Knowledge-Guided Restoration**: Ecological reparations fund restoration projects designed and implemented by Indigenous communities using Traditional Ecological Knowledge rather than colonial conservation approaches through [Indigenous restoration protocols](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#indigenous-restoration).
- **Sacred Site Restoration Priority**: Reparations prioritize restoration of sacred sites and culturally significant landscapes, recognizing that spiritual and ecological health are inseparable in Traditional Knowledge systems.
- **Ecosystem Service Compensation**: Direct payments to Indigenous communities for ecosystem stewardship and restoration work, recognizing Traditional Knowledge as essential infrastructure for planetary health maintenance.

### Corporate Ecological Accountability

| Individual vs. Collective Distribution | Medium | High | [Traditional Knowledge governance protocols](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#collective-governance) ensuring reparations serve collective sovereignty building rather than individual accumulation or welfare models. |
| Cultural Appropriation in Implementation | Medium | High | [Elder Council authority](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#elder-authority) and [Traditional Knowledge protection protocols](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#tek-protection) preventing cultural appropriation while enabling appropriate Traditional Knowledge implementation. |
| Inadequate Funding Scale | Medium | Medium | International legal advocacy and Global South solidarity building to ensure reparations match the actual scale of ecological and colonial debt rather than tokenistic compensation amounts. |

## <a id="case-study"></a>Case Study

**New Zealand Waikato River Settlement (Te Ture Whaimana o Te Awa o Waikato)**: The 2010 Waikato River Settlement represents one of the most comprehensive reparations agreements for ecological destruction, providing legal recognition of the river as an ancestor with rights, co-governance authority between Māori communities and the Crown, and $210 million in restoration funding controlled by Māori institutions. The settlement established the Waikato River Authority with equal Māori and Crown representation, implemented Traditional Knowledge-based restoration protocols including cultural burning and native species reintroduction, and created ongoing funding mechanisms for long-term restoration work guided by Māori cultural values and ecological knowledge. This case demonstrates successful ecological reparations that strengthen Indigenous sovereignty while restoring ecosystem health, informing comprehensive reparations approaches that combine legal recognition, Indigenous control, Traditional Knowledge implementation, and adequate funding scale, reflected in the Ecological Debt Calculator and Land Rematriation Campaign Toolkit.

## <a id="integration-with-framework"></a>Integration with Framework

Reparations framework serves as the economic justice foundation for Golden Triangle implementation:

- **[Treaty Integration](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home)**: Reparations utilize [Global Taxation Mechanisms](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#global-taxation) for funding while supporting [Global Systemic Stability](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#systemic-stability) through Indigenous-led restoration and sovereignty building.
- **[Indigenous Framework Leadership](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge)**: All reparations guided by [Traditional Knowledge systems](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#traditional-knowledge), [Indigenous sovereignty principles](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#indigenous-sovereignty), and [seven-generation accountability](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#seven-generation-planning).
- **[Meta-Governance Coordination](/frameworks/meta-governance)**: Reparations coordinate through [Economic Meta-Council](/frameworks/meta-governance#economic-coordination) while maintaining Indigenous sovereignty over allocation and implementation decisions through Traditional Knowledge governance.

Success tracked through [Indigenous-controlled monitoring](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#indigenous-monitoring) and [Traditional Knowledge assessment protocols](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#traditional-assessment) that measure sovereignty strengthening, ecological restoration, and cultural revitalization rather than colonial development metrics.

## <a id="call-to-action"></a>Call to Action

Reparations implementation requires immediate action supporting Indigenous sovereignty and accountability for colonial extraction:

1. **Calculate and Demand Ecological Debt Repayment**: Use the [Ecological Debt Calculator](/frameworks/tools/nested-economies/ecological-debt-calculator-en.pdf) to assess corporate and government ecological debt and demand restoration funding controlled by Indigenous communities.
2. **Support Land Rematriation Campaigns**: Join Indigenous-led [land back campaigns](/frameworks/tools/nested-economies/land-rematriation-campaign-en.pdf) advocating for return of traditional territories to Indigenous stewardship with adequate restoration funding.
3. **Pursue Corporate Accountability**: Advocate for [corporate reparations](/frameworks/tools/nested-economies/corporate-accountability-legal-en.pdf) from extractive industries and multinational corporations that have profited from Indigenous territories and Traditional Knowledge.
4. **Build Indigenous Financial Institutions**: Support development of [Indigenous-controlled financial institutions](/frameworks/tools/nested-economies/indigenous-financial-institutions-en.pdf) that manage reparations according to Traditional Knowledge principles rather than extractive banking models.
5. **Advocate for Traditional Knowledge Compensation**: Campaign for [Traditional Knowledge compensation](/frameworks/tools/nested-economies/tek-compensation-framework-en.pdf) from corporations that have appropriated Indigenous knowledge for pharmaceutical, agricultural, and technological development.

By centering reparations as debt repayment rather than charity, this framework transforms global economic relationships from extraction and accumulation to restoration and reciprocity, ensuring that those who have borne the costs of colonial capitalism receive the resources necessary for planetary healing and Indigenous sovereignty building.
