> *"When we heal the Earth, we heal ourselves. When we honor the ancestors, we heal the future."* ‚Äî Indigenous proverb

The *Regenerative Economic Integration Framework* represents humanity's blueprint for transforming the global economy from an extractive colonial system into a regenerative Indigenous-led ecosystem that serves all beings across seven generations. Rooted in Traditional Ecological Knowledge, bioregional stewardship, and ceremonial governance, this framework operationalizes the economic vision of the **Golden Triangle**: implementing the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home) institutional mechanisms through [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge) wisdom and coordinated via [Meta-Governance](/frameworks/meta-governance) architecture.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

**Framework Position**: This Regenerative Economic Integration Framework serves as the **economic implementation blueprint** within the Golden Triangle ecosystem, translating the Treaty's global taxation mechanisms and the Indigenous Framework's regenerative principles into practical economic systems while coordinating through meta-governance architecture. It positions Indigenous economic sovereignty, Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and bioregional stewardship as the foundation for planetary economic transformation.

### The Economic Polycrisis and Regenerative Response

**The Crisis**: The global economic system faces cascading collapse‚Äîfrom climate destruction costing $54 trillion by 2050, to inequality reaching levels unseen since feudalism, to extractive systems that have destroyed 60% of ecosystem services in 50 years. Traditional economic indicators like GDP measure destruction as growth while Indigenous communities who've stewarded 80% of global biodiversity face systematic economic marginalization.

**The Indigenous-Led Solution**: For millennia, Indigenous peoples have demonstrated economic systems based on reciprocity, seven-generation thinking, and ecological integration. These proven models‚Äîfrom Pacific Northwest potlatch economies to African ubuntu systems‚Äîoffer tested pathways for economic transformation that creates abundance while regenerating the living world.

**The Regenerative Vision**: This framework transforms economic systems from extraction to regeneration by:
- **Centering Indigenous Economic Sovereignty**: Recognizing Indigenous peoples as the primary architects of sustainable economics
- **Implementing Gross Planetary Health (GPH)**: Replacing GDP with metrics that measure genuine well-being
- **Establishing Comprehensive Reparations**: Healing centuries of extraction through ecological and social restoration  
- **Creating Bioregional Economic Democracy**: Aligning economic activity with ecological boundaries and Traditional Ecological Knowledge

### Golden Triangle Integration

This framework operationalizes economic transformation through three interconnected pillars:

**üèõÔ∏è [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home) Implementation**:
- **Global Taxation Mechanisms**: Financial Transaction Tax (0.1%) and Carbon Tax generating $400B annually for global public goods
- **Planetary Boundary Economics**: Economic policies constrained by ecological limits and regenerative capacity
- **Crisis Response Coordination**: Rapid economic stabilization during climate, pandemic, and systemic shocks

**üåç [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge) Leadership**:
- **Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)**: Indigenous-led economic territories with full sovereignty over resources and development
- **Traditional Ecological Knowledge Integration**: Economic planning guided by millennia-tested ecological wisdom
- **Ceremonial Governance**: Decision-making processes that honor all beings and seven-generation impacts

**üï∏Ô∏è [Meta-Governance](/frameworks/meta-governance) Coordination**:
- **Economic Meta-Council**: Coordinating financial institutions, labor organizations, environmental stewards, and Indigenous nations
- **Corporate Accountability Frameworks**: Comprehensive governance of multinational corporations within planetary boundaries
- **Democratic Economic Oversight**: Ensuring economic transformation serves communities rather than capital

### 2050 Vision: Economic Regeneration Realized

By 2050, this framework envisions:
- **80% of critical ecosystems** under Indigenous-led Bioregional Autonomous Zone stewardship
- **Gross Planetary Health Index** replacing GDP globally, measuring genuine prosperity
- **$1 trillion in reparations** flowing to Indigenous communities and ecological restoration
- **100% renewable energy economy** coordinated through bioregional planning
- **Zero waste, circular economy** based on Traditional Ecological Knowledge principles
- **Universal basic services** ensuring a dignified life for all within planetary boundaries, implemented through the dedicated [AUBI Framework](/frameworks/aubi).

**Core Transformation Principles**:
- **Indigenous Economic Sovereignty**: Traditional knowledge guides all economic planning
- **Regenerative Abundance**: Economic systems that create wealth by healing ecosystems
- **Seven-Generation Accountability**: All economic decisions assessed for impacts across 200+ years
- **Reciprocity Economics**: Gift economies and mutual aid replacing extraction and exploitation
- **Bioregional Democracy**: Economic governance aligned with ecological boundaries
- **Corporate Accountability**: Business serving community and planetary well-being
- **Reparative Justice**: Healing centuries of extraction through systematic restoration

## <a id="framework-position"></a>Framework Position within Golden Triangle

### Primary Integration Pathways

This economic framework serves as the **practical implementation bridge** connecting the Golden Triangle's institutional vision with on-the-ground transformation:

**üîó Treaty Implementation Bridge**:
- Operationalizes Treaty's [Global Taxation System](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#global-taxation) through concrete mechanisms
- Implements [Crisis Governance Protocols](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#crisis-governance) for economic stabilization
- Realizes [Global Public Goods Funding](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#public-goods-funding) through regenerative revenue streams

**üå± Indigenous Wisdom Integration**:
- Centers [Bioregional Autonomous Zones](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#bioregional-zones) as primary economic governance model
- Implements [Gross Planetary Health Index](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#gph-index) as core economic metric
- Operationalizes [Reparations Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#reparations) through concrete mechanisms

**üîÑ Meta-Governance Coordination**:
- Establishes [Economic Meta-Council](/frameworks/meta-governance#economic-coordination) for cross-sector alignment
- Implements [Corporate Accountability](/frameworks/meta-governance#corporate-accountability) frameworks
- Realizes [Economic Sufficiency & Circulation](/frameworks/meta-governance#economic-principles) principles

### Strategic Coherence with Global Governance Vision

The framework aligns with the broader global governance transformation by:
- **Institutional Reform Support**: Economic mechanisms that fund and incentivize Treaty institution implementation
- **Indigenous Sovereignty Recognition**: Economic systems that strengthen rather than undermine Indigenous self-determination
- **Meta-Governance Enablement**: Economic coordination that exemplifies polycentric, democratic governance
