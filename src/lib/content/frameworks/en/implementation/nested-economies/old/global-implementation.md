Planetary Economic Governance represents the capstone transformation of the Regenerative Economic Integration Framework, creating a global economic system that serves all beings across seven generations while respecting planetary boundaries and Indigenous sovereignty. This section operationalizes the economic vision of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home) through [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge) wisdom and [Meta-Governance](/frameworks/meta-governance) coordination, establishing mechanisms for global taxation, reparative justice, Indigenous economic sovereignty, and planetary regeneration that replace extractive colonial economics with regenerative abundance for all.

## <a id="historical-context-planetary-economic-transformation"></a>Historical Context: Planetary Economic Transformation

The transformation toward planetary economic governance emerges from recognizing that current global economic systems—designed during colonial expansion and industrial extraction—are fundamentally incompatible with Indigenous sovereignty, ecological integrity, and planetary survival.

### Colonial Economic Legacy and Its Failures

**The Bretton Woods System (1944-1971) and Beyond**:
The post-WWII global economic architecture was designed by and for colonial powers, systematically excluding Indigenous nations, Global South voices, and ecological considerations. The World Bank, IMF, and WTO institutionalized extraction from the Global South to enrich colonial centers, while imposing structural adjustment programs that dismantled traditional economies and ecological stewardship systems.

**Extractive Finance and Ecological Destruction**:
The global financial system has channeled over $50 trillion into fossil fuel extraction since 1980, while Indigenous territories—protecting 80% of global biodiversity—receive less than 1% of climate finance. This systematic misdirection of resources demonstrates the need for completely restructured global economic governance that centers Indigenous wisdom and ecological regeneration.

**Debt Colonialism and Ongoing Extraction**:
External debt has become the primary mechanism for continued colonial extraction, with Global South countries paying $4.2 trillion in debt service since 1980—more than they received in "aid"—while their ecosystems are destroyed and traditional economies dismantled. This debt system requires transformation through comprehensive reparations and economic sovereignty restoration.

### Indigenous Economic Alternatives and Proven Models

**Traditional Global Trade Networks**:
Before colonial disruption, Indigenous trade networks spanning continents operated through reciprocity, mutual aid, and ecological stewardship. The Pacific Northwest-Great Plains trade routes, trans-Saharan networks, and Pacific Island navigation systems demonstrate that global coordination can occur while respecting local sovereignty and ecological limits.

**Contemporary Indigenous Economic Leadership**:
Modern Indigenous economic initiatives demonstrate regenerative alternatives at scale. The Menominee Nation's sustainable forestry enterprise has generated profit for over 150 years while increasing forest biodiversity. Māori asset management following Waitangi settlements integrates traditional values with contemporary finance, managing billions while strengthening culture and ecosystems.

**Planetary Boundary Economic Science**:
Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge, validated by contemporary ecological science, demonstrates that economic systems must operate within planetary boundaries. The concept of "enough" embedded in traditional economies offers proven pathways for abundance within ecological limits that colonial economics has systematically ignored.

### The Necessity for Planetary Economic Governance

**Climate Emergency and Economic Transformation**:
Climate breakdown—costing $23 trillion annually by 2100 without transformation—requires complete economic system restructuring. The [IPCC AR6 synthesis](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#climate-crisis) demonstrates that maintaining current economic systems while attempting climate stabilization is impossible; planetary economic governance offers the only viable pathway for rapid decarbonization while ensuring justice.

**Inequality Crisis and Reparative Justice**:
Global wealth inequality has reached levels unseen since feudalism, with 1% of the global population controlling 50% of wealth while 3.6 billion people lack access to basic needs. This inequality directly results from colonial extraction and requires systematic reparations and economic sovereignty restoration rather than charitable redistribution.

**Biodiversity Collapse and Traditional Knowledge**:
The ongoing sixth mass extinction threatens the ecological foundation of all economic activity. Indigenous territories, representing 22% of global land area, protect 80% of biodiversity through Traditional Ecological Knowledge systems. Planetary economic governance must center Indigenous stewardship to prevent ecosystem collapse that would destroy all economic systems.

By learning from Indigenous economic wisdom while addressing contemporary planetary crises, planetary economic governance creates pathways for abundance that regenerate rather than destroy the conditions for life.

## <a id="case-study"></a>Case Study

**Māori Economic Development Post-Waitangi Settlements (1990s-Present)**: Demonstrates large-scale Indigenous economic sovereignty where traditional values guide contemporary economics. Māori collective assets have grown from $500M to $50B while strengthening cultural identity and ecological stewardship. Key innovations include:

- **Traditional Value Integration**: Whakapapa (relationships) and kaitiakitanga (guardianship) guide billion-dollar investment decisions
- **Intergenerational Planning**: Seven-generation thinking embedded in asset management and development decisions
- **Cultural-Economic Integration**: Economic success measured by cultural vitality and environmental health alongside financial returns
- **Indigenous Governance**: Māori authorities controlling economic development according to traditional protocols

**Lessons for Planetary Implementation**: Demonstrates that Indigenous economic sovereignty creates prosperity while strengthening culture and healing ecosystems. Success requires legal recognition, adequate reparations, and respectful partnership with traditional governance systems.
