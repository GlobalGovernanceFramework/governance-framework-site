Visualizations for Economic Integration are essential to the Nested Sovereignty Framework, providing intuitive, transparent, and accessible tools to illustrate the framework’s structure, progress, and impact across local, regional, and global levels. By leveraging dashboards, diagrams, GIS maps, and a new technical architecture diagram, this section fosters stakeholder understanding, engagement, and accountability, aligning with the principles of sovereignty, interoperability, justice, and adaptability. Co-designed with indigenous communities, women, non-binary individuals, and marginalized groups, these visualizations prioritize accessibility, inclusivity, and cultural relevance to ensure all stakeholders can interact with and benefit from the framework’s insights.

## <a id="mechanisms"></a>Mechanisms
Visualization mechanisms operate across three levels to communicate the framework’s dynamics, now enhanced with a technical architecture diagram:
- **Local Visualizations**:
  - **Community Dashboards**: Interactive displays show local KPIs (e.g., 70% transaction share, 80% budgeting participation) using gauges and bar charts, accessible via web and offline PDF exports.
  - **Local GIS Maps**: Maps visualize economic assets (e.g., cooperatives, commons), co-designed with indigenous input to reflect traditional land use.
  - **Storytelling Graphics**: Infographics highlight community successes (e.g., currency pilots), tailored for low-literacy audiences.
- **Regional Visualizations**:
  - **Regional Dashboards**: Aggregate data on trade zones and watershed protocols (e.g., 90% trade compliance), with comparative charts for cross-community insights.
  - **Regional GIS Maps**: Illustrate resource flows (e.g., water, trade routes), ensuring 50% women/non-binary and indigenous representation in design.
  - **Network Diagrams**: Show interdependencies between communities, highlighting redistribution and collaboration.
- **Global Visualizations**:
  - **Global Dashboards**: Display global KPIs (e.g., 80% treaty adoption, 90% AUBI coverage) using dynamic visualizations, hosted at globalgovernanceframework.org.
  - **Nested Systems Diagram**: A layered diagram (green local circles, blue regional webs, red global sphere) illustrates framework interconnections.
  - **Global Impact Maps**: GIS-based maps track commons governance and crisis fund impacts, with multilingual annotations.
- **Technical Architecture Diagram**:
  - **Purpose**: Illustrates the framework’s digital and offline systems (e.g., blockchain ledgers, DecideTogether, GIS tools) and their interconnections, ensuring transparency and accessibility.
  - **Description**: The diagram depicts a layered architecture with components for data collection, processing, storage, and visualization, integrating digital and offline workflows. It includes:
    - **Local Layer**: Community nodes (e.g., Raspberry Pi) for blockchain transactions, offline paper ledgers, and SMS-based inputs.
    - **Regional Layer**: Aggregator servers syncing local data via APIs, supporting trade zone analytics and GIS mapping.
    - **Global Layer**: Cloud-based platforms (e.g., Nested Economic Health Index) with IPFS for decentralized storage, linked to UN and NGO oversight.
    - **Integration**: APIs and sync protocols (e.g., weekly offline-to-digital uploads) ensure interoperability, with accessibility features (e.g., screen readers, multilingual interfaces).
  - **Text-Based Representation** (Markdown-compatible ASCII):

| Accessibility Gaps | Medium | High | Low-tech options (paper, radio) and tech transfer to bridge divides. |
| Low Engagement | Low | Medium | Inclusive designs (multilingual, culturally relevant) and campaigns to boost usage. |
| Funding Shortages | Low | High | Diversified funding (multilateral, PPPs, philanthropy) with crowdfunding contingency. |

## <a id="case-study"></a>Case Study
- **Great Lakes Commons (North America)**: GIS maps and dashboards visualized water governance, increasing stakeholder engagement by 40%. Its accessible visualizations, co-designed with indigenous groups and including a technical architecture diagram for data flows, inform the framework’s approach, emphasizing cultural relevance and offline access, reflected in the Resource Mapping Tool and Visualization Design Toolkit.

## <a id="integration-with-framework"></a>Integration with Framework
Visualizations for Economic Integration advance the framework’s principles:
- **Sovereignty**: Local dashboards and the technical architecture diagram empower communities to monitor their systems.
- **Interoperability**: Visualizations sync data across scales via APIs and blockchain, as depicted in the architecture diagram.
- **Justice**: Inclusive design ensures marginalized groups access insights.
- **Adaptability**: Feedback-driven updates keep visualizations relevant, tracked via the Nested Economic Health Index.

Tools are accessible via the **Economic Integration Seed Kit**, and progress is visualized in the **Nested Systems Diagram** (green local circles, blue regional webs, red global sphere). Visualizations link to other framework components through interdependencies, such as digital access for AUBI and climate compliance for trade zones.

## <a id="call-to-action"></a>Call to Action
Stakeholders are invited to:
1. Deploy dashboards and the technical architecture diagram using the Nested Economic Health Index Dashboard.
2. Create maps with the Resource Mapping Tool.
3. Design graphics via the Visualization Design Toolkit.
4. Join the real-time collaboration platform (globalgovernanceframework.org/collab) to co-develop visualization innovations.
