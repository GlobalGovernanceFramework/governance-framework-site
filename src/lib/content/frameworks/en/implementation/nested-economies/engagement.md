**Estimated Reading Time**: 16 minutes

*Elena presents her Hearts currency pilot to healthcare workers across California, sharing not just technical details but stories of community transformation—how sliding-scale healthcare enabled a grandmother to access diabetes care, how Hearts payments attracted young healers to community work, how democratic governance gave residents voice in clinic priorities. Maya speaks at watershed conferences about bioregional cooperation, demonstrating how traditional knowledge and scientific monitoring create superior restoration outcomes while building economic sustainability for conservation work. Joseph travels to Indigenous governance gatherings, sharing protocols for protecting traditional knowledge within contemporary economic systems while maintaining ceremonial authority and cultural sovereignty.*

*Their outreach work demonstrates that public engagement for nested economies requires more than information sharing—it demands relationship building, story telling, and movement coordination that honors diverse cultural approaches to communication while building solidarity across differences. The Community Weaver role provides professional infrastructure for this engagement while strategic communications reach broader audiences ready for economic transformation.*
