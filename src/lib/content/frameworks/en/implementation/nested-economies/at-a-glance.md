# Nested Economies: At-a-Glance

*Building Economies of Right Relationship Through Community Cooperation*

## The Challenge We Face

Communities worldwide are trapped in an impossible choice: remain economically isolated and vulnerable, or integrate into systems that extract their wealth, exploit their labor, and erode their cultures.

- **$76 billion annually** extracted from local economies by chain retailers while small businesses struggle
- **$13 trillion care economy** remains invisible and unrewarded in traditional markets
- **Indigenous communities** face appropriation of traditional knowledge without consent or benefit
- **Climate crisis** demands cooperation, but current integration models sacrifice local autonomy for efficiency

## The Transformation We Need

**From:** Choose between economic isolation or exploitative integration  
**To:** Cooperation that strengthens rather than threatens local sovereignty

## Core Innovation: Hearts Currency + Community Control

### üíö **Hearts Currency**
Community-controlled money that rewards what traditional markets ignore:
- Caregiving and elder support
- Cultural preservation and language teaching  
- Ecological restoration and climate action
- Community organizing and conflict resolution

### üçÉ **Leaves Tokens**  
Recognizing specific ecological contributions:
- Carbon sequestration and soil restoration
- Biodiversity protection and habitat creation
- Traditional ecological knowledge application
- Climate adaptation and resilience building

### üì± **Love Ledger**
Blockchain platform that transparently tracks contributions while protecting community data sovereignty and enabling verification across regional networks.

## Three Levels of Integration

### üèòÔ∏è **Local: Community-Controlled Economics**
- Hearts wallets with democratic governance over money creation
- Participatory budgeting achieving 80% community participation
- Community land trusts preventing speculation and displacement
- Worker cooperatives providing democratic ownership alternatives

### üåä **Regional: Bioregional Coordination**  
- Hearts trade zones following watershed boundaries, not political borders
- 10% of trade revenue automatically redistributes to under-resourced communities
- Bioregional councils coordinating infrastructure and crisis response
- Indigenous territorial sovereignty recognition and protection

### üåç **Global: Commons Governance**
- AUBI (Adaptive Universal Basic Income) providing economic security through Hearts/fiat hybrid
- Automation taxes funding global commons and crisis response
- Technology commons preventing corporate capture of essential digital infrastructure
- Climate coordination enabling rapid decarbonization with community sovereignty

## Governance That Actually Works

### Community Weavers
Professional facilitators trained in Hearts mechanics, cultural protocols, and stakeholder engagement‚Äîensuring authentic community participation while respecting Indigenous sovereignty and traditional knowledge.

### Social Resilience Council  
Primary governance body with 40% Indigenous representation and Earth Council veto authority, overseeing Hearts supply management and ethical oversight while preventing elite capture.

### Indigenous Earth Council
Ultimate authority ensuring nested economies strengthens rather than undermines Indigenous territorial rights, traditional governance, and cultural integrity.

## Implementation: Start Small, Scale Carefully

### **Phase 1 (Years 1-3): Foundation**
- 10 community pilots with $50M investment
- Train 500 Community Weavers in cultural competency
- Demonstrate 70% community satisfaction, 15% local business revenue increase
- **If pilots fail ‚Üí stop, no wider rollout**

### **Phase 2 (Years 3-5): Regional Integration**  
- 25 communities across 5 bioregions
- AUBI Layer 1-2 implementation providing baseline security + contribution bonuses
- 50% Hearts adoption rate with voluntary participation only
- **Multiple exit ramps for communities wanting different approaches**

### **Phase 3 (Years 5-10): Global Coordination**
- 100 bioregional networks with Indigenous leadership
- Full AUBI system including global stabilization mechanisms  
- 80% reduction in wealth disparities between participating communities
- **Traditional economic systems remain fully available**

## What Makes This Different

### ‚ùå **Current Integration Models:**
- Force communities to abandon traditional governance for market participation
- Extract wealth from communities to distant shareholders
- Override local democratic decisions through corporate trade agreements
- Concentrate power in unaccountable international institutions

### ‚úÖ **Nested Economies:**
- **Community veto authority** over all economic decisions affecting their territory
- **Wealth circulation** keeps resources local through Hearts currency systems
- **Cultural sovereignty protection** with Indigenous Earth Council oversight
- **Democratic participation** through Community Weavers and transparent governance

## Evidence Base: Building on Proven Success

**Community Currencies:** Bristol Pound demonstrated 15% increase in local business revenue  
**Resource Dividends:** Alaska Permanent Fund proves 40+ years of wealth sharing without work disincentives  
**Worker Cooperatives:** Mondrag√≥n Corporation: 70,000+ worker-owners, ‚Ç¨12B+ revenue, superior job security  
**Participatory Budgeting:** 1,500+ cities worldwide show communities make better resource allocation decisions

## Economic Security Through AUBI Integration

### Layer 1: Universal Baseline ($500/month hybrid Hearts/fiat)
Economic security enabling genuine choice about work and community participation

### Layer 2: Contribution Bonuses (10 Hearts/hour)  
Recognition for care work, ecological restoration, cultural preservation validated through Love Ledger

### Layer 3: Equity Adjustments
Reparations for historical injustices and support for marginalized communities

### Layer 4: Global Stabilization
Crisis response ensuring no community faces emergency alone

## Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)

**Replacing GDP with what actually creates thriving communities:**
- **Love (40%):** Care relationships, community solidarity, conflict resolution
- **Meaning (30%):** Cultural vitality, traditional knowledge transmission, artistic expression  
- **Connection (30%):** Ecological stewardship, human-land relationships, biodiversity

## Crisis Response Capabilities

### **48-Hour Activation** for natural disasters, economic shocks, health emergencies
### **Regional Mutual Aid** through Hearts currency and solidarity funds
### **Community Sovereignty** maintained during crisis response
### **Traditional Knowledge Integration** for proven resilience strategies

## Integration with Global Governance

Nested Economies operates as the **economic integration specialist** within the broader Global Governance Framework:
- üåç **Treaty for Our Only Home** (legal enforcement and commons protection)
- üèõÔ∏è **Indigenous Governance** (traditional authority and cultural sovereignty)  
- üíö **Planetary Health** (ecological restoration and climate action)
- ‚öñÔ∏è **Meta-Governance** (democratic coordination and conflict resolution)

## Get Started Today

### **Communities:** Access readiness assessment and pilot program applications
### **Governments:** Model legislation supporting community currencies and cooperative development
### **Organizations:** Hearts currency acceptance and Community Weaver training programs  
### **Individuals:** Join local cooperatives and support alternative economic development

## The Funding Reality

**Phase 1:** $50M across 10 pilots (proven by successful community currency models)  
**Phase 2:** $200M across bioregions (less than most corporate subsidies)
**Phase 3:** $1B for global coordination (fraction of military spending, funded by automation taxes)

**Revenue Sources:** Automation taxes, resource extraction fees, commons dividends, voluntary contributions from successful communities

## Why This Matters Now

**The Choice is Real:** Communities can either continue losing wealth to distant corporations while facing climate breakdown, or build cooperative relationships that keep resources local while addressing planetary challenges.

**The Technology Exists:** Blockchain infrastructure, mobile applications, and proven governance models enable community-controlled economic systems at unprecedented scale.

**The Movement is Growing:** From Indigenous sovereignty assertions to cooperative enterprises to climate action, communities worldwide seek alternatives to extractive economic integration.

**Success Creates Success:** Each successful pilot demonstrates that cooperation can compete with exploitation, inspiring broader adoption while maintaining community choice.

## The Future We Choose

**Current Path:** Economic colonialism extracting wealth from communities, climate crisis accelerating while solutions are blocked by corporate interests, democratic erosion through economic concentration.

**Nested Economies Path:** Communities cooperating by choice not force, economic security enabling creativity and care, Indigenous sovereignty strengthened through economic relationships, planetary challenges addressed through democratic coordination.

**The transformation from extraction to Right Relationship begins with each community that chooses cooperation over competition, each Hearts transaction that keeps wealth local, each person who values care over accumulation.**

**We have the tools. We have the evidence. We have the choice.**

**The economics of Right Relationship begin now.**
