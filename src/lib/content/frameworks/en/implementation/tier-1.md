## Tier 1: The Core Operating Systems

This tier contains the fundamental frameworks that serve as the "operating systems" for a regenerative civilization. They don't solve one specific problem; instead, they provide the essential, cross-cutting functions for governance (`Meta-Governance`), ethics (`Indigenous Framework`), justice (`Justice & Peace Cluster`), economy (`AUBI`, `Financial Systems`), and technology (`TGIF`, `Aurora Accord`) that all other frameworks rely on to function.
