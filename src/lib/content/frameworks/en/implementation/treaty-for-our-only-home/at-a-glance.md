# At a Glance: Treaty for Our Only Home

## The Vision & Principles

### The Challenge: The Global Polycrisis
Humanity faces cascading failures in our climate, economic, and political systems. Our 20th-century governance institutions are inadequate for these 21st-century challenges. The cost of inaction is catastrophic.

### The Solution: A Framework for Resilience
The "Treaty for Our Only Home" is a ready-to-implement blueprint to upgrade global governance. It transforms our systems from generating crises to generating resilience, ensuring ecological integrity and shared prosperity.

### The Core Principles
1.  **Subsidiarity & Polycentrism:** Governance at the lowest effective level.
2.  **Democratic Legitimacy & Inclusivity:** Authority derived from the people.
3.  **Accountability & Rule of Law:** Enforceable international law for all.
4.  **Agility & Adaptability:** Dynamic institutions that can respond and renew.
5.  **Ecological Integrity & Intergenerational Equity:** Prioritizing planetary boundaries and future generations.
6.  **Ethical & Epistemic Integrity:** Governance grounded in truth and ethics.
7.  **Minimum Viable Governance:** Simple, high-impact reforms.
