*The GSCL Framework's technology architecture represents a fundamental shift from extractive surveillance capitalism to regenerative community empowerment. Every technological choice—from IoT sensor placement to AI algorithm design—operates under democratic governance with Indigenous data sovereignty as the foundational principle. This is not just about making supply chains more efficient; it's about ensuring technology serves life, community, and planetary healing rather than corporate profit and social control.*

## <a id="ethical-tech-framework"></a>Ethical Technology Deployment Framework

### Community-First Technology Principles

The GSCL Framework deploys technology according to community sovereignty principles that ensure innovation serves rather than dominates the communities it affects.
