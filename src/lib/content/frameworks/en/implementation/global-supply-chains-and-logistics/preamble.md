# Preamble

Beneath the forest floor, a hidden network of fungal threads connects root to root, sharing nutrients, information, and strength across the entire ecosystem. This is the oldest logistics network on Earth. It operates not on extraction, but on reciprocity.

Let our new supply chains learn from this ancient wisdom. Let them become a human mycelial network, connecting bioregion to bioregion, not with dominance, but with decentralized resilience. Let them carry what is needed, where it is needed, fostering a world where the health of each community contributes to the flourishing of the whole.
