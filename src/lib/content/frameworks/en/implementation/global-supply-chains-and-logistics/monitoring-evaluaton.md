# Monitoring & Evaluation: Community-Controlled Assessment for Regenerative Transformation

> *"What we measure shapes what we value, and what we value shapes what we become. When communities control their own evaluation systems, when traditional knowledge guides our understanding of success, when the wellbeing of future generations matters more than quarterly profits—then measurement becomes a tool for collective flourishing rather than individual accumulation."*

*The GSCL Framework's monitoring and evaluation systems represent a fundamental shift from extractive measurement that serves external interests to regenerative assessment that serves community flourishing and planetary healing. By centering community control, traditional knowledge, and long-term thinking, these systems ensure that evaluation strengthens rather than undermines the transformation they measure.*
