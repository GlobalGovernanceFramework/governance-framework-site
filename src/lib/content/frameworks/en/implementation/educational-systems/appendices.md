### <a id="power-mapping-tools"></a>Power-Mapping Tools
*A comprehensive toolkit for analyzing and shifting power dynamics in education systems*

**Description**: This toolkit provides practical methods for understanding how power operates in your educational context and developing strategies to redistribute it more equitably while building support for transformative change.

#### **Stakeholder Power Grid**
**Purpose**: Systematically identify key actors, assess their influence levels, and understand their current alignment with framework goals.

The grid helps you map stakeholders across dimensions of power and stance, from resistant to allied. For example, a National Education Ministry might have high power (level 5) but neutral stance due to test-focused priorities, while a Local Indigenous Council might have significant power (level 4) and strong alignment as an ally interested in cultural preservation and land sovereignty.

**How to Use**: Complete the grid through community workshops or stakeholder interviews, then prioritize engaging "neutral" high-power actors while amplifying marginalized voices and strengthening existing alliances.

#### **Power-Flow Analysis**
**Purpose**: Map how decisions and resources actually move in your context, identifying both formal processes and informal influence networks.

This analysis reveals decision nodes (like textbook approval flowing from Ministry to District Office to School Principals), blockages (such as principals fearing union pushback), and alternative pathways (like piloting assessments as "extracurricular projects" to bypass resistance).

#### **Resistance Readiness Checklist**
**Purpose**: Anticipate potential backlash and prepare mitigation strategies before challenges arise.

The checklist covers political risks (with strategies like framing curricula as "heritage preservation"), resource challenges (with emergency grant identification), and cultural tensions (such as partnering with local elders as ambassadors for change).

#### **Shadow Power Mapping**
**Purpose**: Uncover hidden influencers and informal networks that often hold significant sway over educational decisions.

Methods include "Who Really Decides?" interviews with marginalized communities and network mapping that reveals connections between actors, helping identify unexpected allies and influence pathways.

#### **Liberatory Power-Building Strategies**
**Purpose**: Redistribute power to marginalized groups through concrete tactics and structural changes.

Examples include co-governance models where youth councils have veto power over budget decisions, counter-data initiatives where communities conduct their own monitoring and evaluation to challenge official metrics, and parallel systems like underground educator networks in censored states.

**Example Use Case**: A teacher in Vietnam wanting to pilot spiral dynamics but facing ministry resistance used the power grid to identify a neutral Curriculum Director as a key target, discovered through power-flow analysis that principals could approve electives without ministry signoff, and found through shadow mapping that a respected retired official mentored current leaders, leading to a successful workshop collaboration.

**Connections**:
- **Bureaucratic Navigation**: Complements the bureaucratic toolkit with power analysis methods
- **Political Strategy**: Provides tactical tools for advocacy and engagement efforts
- **Implementation Planning**: Supports strategic planning for pilot launches and scaling efforts
- **Equity Integration**: Centers power redistribution as essential to educational transformation

### <a id="facilitator-scripts"></a>Facilitator Scripts for Cultural Tensions
*Practical guides to navigate resistance, foster dialogue, and adapt content while maintaining equity commitments*

**Description**: This collection provides facilitators with tested scripts and approaches for leading difficult conversations around potentially sensitive topics, helping navigate cultural tensions while maintaining the framework's equity commitments.

#### **Script: Introducing Spiritual Literacy**
**Context**: When facilitating modules that integrate Indigenous, mystical, or secular worldviews in conservative or religious communities.

The script opens with inclusive framing: "Today, we'll explore how different cultures understand our place in the world. This isn't about changing beliefs—it's about listening to the many ways humans find meaning." It provides concrete examples from different traditions and invites sharing about local meaning-making practices.

**Safeguards**: Uses neutral imagery, involves community co-design with local elders, provides opt-out options for private reflection, and in authoritarian contexts can be framed as "cultural heritage studies" using local heroes and historical figures.

#### **Script: Discussing Colonial Legacies**
**Context**: When teaching about historical oppression in communities with mixed identities, such as settings with both settler and Indigenous learners.

The script uses the metaphor of history as a river that sometimes nourishes and sometimes floods, then guides participants to acknowledge facts, honor resistance, and focus on repair actions. It emphasizes third-party examples initially and centers survivor voices while ending with tangible next steps.

#### **Script: LGBTQ+ Inclusion in Conservative Areas**
**Context**: When facilitating gender diversity modules in culturally contested environments.

The approach grounds in shared values of safety and respect, uses analogies like left-handed students in right-handed schools, and focuses on designing inclusive classroom rules rather than debating identity categories directly.

#### **Script: Caste/Class Sensitivity**
**Context**: When caste or class hierarchies surface in group work, such as Dalit learners being excluded from activities.

The script provides language for noticing patterns without naming identities directly, reframes through ecosystem metaphors about diversity, and includes practical reset strategies like reshuffling groups using randomized criteria.

#### **Script: Navigating Parent Pushback**
**Context**: When families resist "non-traditional" content such as climate justice or feminist perspectives.

The parent workshop script anchors in shared concerns about children thriving, links content to livelihoods and local values, and invites skeptics to co-design adaptations rather than simply resist changes.

**Template for New Scripts**: Each script follows a consistent format with context description, step-by-step facilitator language, specific safeguards, and adaptation guidance for different political or cultural contexts.

**Purpose**: These scripts prevent harm by naming tensions proactively, honor local wisdom while upholding equity principles, and equip educators to lead challenging conversations with confidence and skill.

**Connections**:
- **Educator Training**: Scripts are embedded in capacity building workshops and professional development
- **Regional Adaptation**: Pairs with regional blueprints for localizing language and approaches
- **Crisis Response**: Links to emergency protocols for de-escalation when tensions escalate
