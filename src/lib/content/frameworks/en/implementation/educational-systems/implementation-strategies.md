### <a id="legacy-system-integration"></a>Legacy System Integration

**The Challenge**: Most educational transformation efforts fail because they try to replace existing systems overnight rather than working skillfully within them while building alternatives. Our approach bridges current education systems with innovative components, creating smooth transitions that don't disrupt established structures or surrender technological control to corporate platforms.

**How It Works**: Instead of demanding wholesale change, we help communities integrate regenerative elements into their existing educational frameworks. This might mean mapping framework competencies like systems thinking to national standards, blending narrative evaluations with traditional exams, or introducing climate projects alongside standard math curricula. The key is using privacy-preserving assessment platforms that protect student data from corporate extraction while demonstrating improved learning outcomes.

**Building Community Power**: Educational pilots coordinate with local digital governance initiatives, ensuring technology transitions happen within broader community empowerment efforts rather than creating new dependencies on corporate educational platforms. Communities learn to control their educational technology while improving learning outcomes.

**Practical Tools**: We provide union engagement agreements, curriculum mapping templates that include digital sovereignty considerations, and stakeholder workshops that train educators, administrators, and unions on both pedagogical innovation and technological independence.

**Example of Integration**: In Vietnam, hybrid assessments could integrate systems thinking into national exams using privacy-preserving platforms developed through local digital governance. **(Illustrative Scenario)** This approach could reach 1,000 students, potentially increasing critical thinking scores by 20% while building community capacity for educational technology control.

**Equity at the Center**: We prioritize marginalized schools—rural, low-income, and underserved communities—for initial pilots, ensuring equitable access to both educational innovation and community-controlled technology. Transition funding supports teacher retraining and infrastructure upgrades, including community-owned digital systems in under-resourced areas.
