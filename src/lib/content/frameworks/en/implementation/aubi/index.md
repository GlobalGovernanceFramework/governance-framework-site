**Framework Development**: This framework represents comprehensive research synthesis developed through iterative refinement using multiple AI systems, integrating evidence-based practices with established principles in economics, social policy, and human development. While developed by an individual researcher leveraging analytical diversity, it stands on a foundation of proven income support mechanisms and urgent global necessity for economic justice.

In a world where technological advancement and global interconnection create unprecedented wealth alongside deepening inequality, the **Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) Framework** offers a revolutionary blueprint for economic transformation—positioning economic security not as welfare, but as the foundation for human flourishing and community regeneration. Grounded in dignity, contribution recognition, and the Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI), this framework reimagines economic systems to reward care work, environmental stewardship, and meaningful community engagement while ensuring no one faces survival anxiety.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

The AUBI Framework is a comprehensive plan to transform global economic security systems, addressing interconnected challenges of poverty, inequality, work disincentives, and the undervaluation of care work. It integrates strategic innovations—from Hearts currency and Love Ledger systems to four-tiered payout structures and cultural adaptation protocols—with Treaty-aligned governance and robust implementation pathways. Moving beyond traditional Universal Basic Income, AUBI creates dynamic, locally-adapted systems that grow stronger through community participation.

**Vision**: Transform economic security from a safety net into a foundation for flourishing, where every person has the freedom to pursue meaningful work, care for their communities, and contribute to ecological regeneration without survival anxiety.

**2040 Commitment**: Every person lives with economic dignity, recognition for their contributions to love, meaning, and connection, and agency over their economic participation in regenerative communities.

**Key Features**:
- **Four-Tiered Payout Structure**: Universal baseline + contribution bonuses + equity supplements + informal recognition
- **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI)**: Replacing GDP with holistic wellbeing metrics
- **Hearts Currency Integration**: Alternative value system for care economy participation
- **Treaty-Aligned Governance**: Integration with global governance reform mechanisms
- **Cultural Adaptation Module**: Community-controlled implementation respecting diverse values
- **Flourishing Guide Support**: Professional mentorship for personal development and contribution opportunities
- **Advanced Technology Infrastructure**: Blockchain verification, AI-mediated impact simulations, gamified engagement
- **Comprehensive Failure Recovery**: Multi-region crisis protocols and Hearts currency failsafe
- **Youth Civic Integration**: Pathways from age 16 for civic engagement and contribution recognition

**Target Metrics by 2035**: 90% basic income security, 80% reduction in survival anxiety, 70% increase in care work recognition, 60% improvement in LMCI scores, 50% participation in contribution systems.

## About This Framework

**Development Status**: The Adaptive Universal Basic Income Framework represents comprehensive analysis synthesized through iterative research across multiple AI systems to ensure diverse analytical perspectives and evidence integration. While developed by an individual researcher, it draws from established principles in economics, social policy, and proven income support mechanisms including the Alaska Permanent Fund, Finland's UBI pilot, and Kenya's GiveDirectly programs.

**Implementation Tool Development**: Tools are being developed in three phases to ensure quality and usability. Phase 1 (Launch & Onboard Kit) is available now for immediate use. Phase 2 (Scale & Legislate Toolkit) will be released throughout 2025-2026. Phase 3 (Advanced & Technical Library) will be developed from 2027 onward in collaboration with technical partners and academic institutions.

**Implementation Guidance**: The framework provides evidence-based guidance for economic security transformation. Implementation should involve consultation with economists, social policy experts, community leaders, and stakeholders familiar with specific economic, cultural, and legal contexts.

**Living Document Status**: This framework is designed for continuous improvement based on implementation experience and emerging research. Version 3.0 represents comprehensive analysis as of June 2025, with regular updates planned based on pilot feedback and new developments.

**The Urgency of Economic Justice**: Current economic systems generate unprecedented inequality while technological advancement could enable abundance for all. Traditional welfare systems trap people in poverty while failing to recognize the care work that makes communities thrive. AUBI offers a path to economic systems that reward human flourishing over pure accumulation.

**The Vision Within Reach**: Every person deserves freedom from survival anxiety. Every community deserves recognition for the care work that sustains it. Every society deserves metrics that measure what truly matters—love, meaning, and connection. The tools exist. The evidence supports it. What remains is the collective will to choose flourishing over fear, cooperation over competition, and care over pure accumulation.

**It begins with economic security. It culminates in human flourishing. It starts now.**
