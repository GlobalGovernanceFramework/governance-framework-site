The AUBI Political Economy framework navigates the complex landscape of existing power structures while building pathways for economic transformation that serves human flourishing rather than elite accumulation. This comprehensive approach balances pragmatic engagement with current systems and radical transformation toward democratic economic governance, ensuring AUBI implementation strengthens rather than undermines authentic democracy and community power.

## <a id="elite-cooperation-capture"></a>Elite Cooperation and Capture Prevention

### 1.1 Strategic Elite Engagement Framework

**Philosophical Approach to Elite Relations:**
AUBI recognizes that successful economic transformation requires sophisticated engagement with existing power holders while preventing system capture that would undermine community empowerment and authentic transformation goals.

**Elite Cooperation Strategy Principles:**

**Mutual Benefit Without Subordination:**
AUBI offers genuine benefits to current economic elites through market expansion, risk reduction, and ESG opportunities while maintaining community control over implementation and preventing elite dominance of system design or operation.

**Transparent Power-Sharing:**
Clear protocols for elite participation that enhance rather than undermine community power, with transparent decision-making processes and community veto authority over elite involvement that threatens local sovereignty.

**System Transformation Through Participation:**
Elite engagement designed to gradually transform elite consciousness and behavior toward cooperation and community benefit rather than extraction and accumulation, creating aligned incentives for authentic transformation.

**Values-Based Boundaries:**
Non-negotiable commitment to AUBI core values including community sovereignty, cultural respect, ecological sustainability, and economic democracy, with elite cooperation conditional on respecting these foundational principles.

### 1.2 Elite Capture Prevention Mechanisms

**Structural Safeguards Against Capture:**

**Dynamic Contribution Caps and Elite Restrictions:**
- **Income-Based Layer 2 Limits**: Contribution bonuses capped at 50% of baseline for individuals in top income quintile, preventing wealthy individuals from dominating community recognition systems
- **Impact Weighting Requirements**: High-income individuals must demonstrate proportionally greater community impact for bonus eligibility, ensuring elite participation serves community rather than individual aggrandizement
- **Community Validation Requirements**: All elite contributions require explicit community consensus confirmation through culturally appropriate validation processes
- **Wealth Concentration Monitoring**: Automated tracking of wealth concentration with dynamic adjustment of caps and requirements to prevent system capture

**Governance Protection Protocols:**
- **Community Veto Authority**: Local communities maintain ultimate authority to reject elite participation that threatens community sovereignty or cultural integrity
