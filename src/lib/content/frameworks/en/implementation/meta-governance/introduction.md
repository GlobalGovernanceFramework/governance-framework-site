# Integrated Meta-Governance

*An introduction to planetary coordination*

Integrated Meta-Governance is the art and architecture of designing, aligning, and evolving governance systems across domains, levels, cultures, and timescales. As global challenges become increasingly interconnected and complex, meta-governance offers the scaffolding necessary to harmonize diverse efforts into a coherent whole—without overriding autonomy, diversity, or subsidiarity.

This framework outlines principles, structures, and mechanisms to guide how various governance domains interact, overlap, and evolve in alignment with shared goals. It is envisioned as a potential "constitution for planetary coordination"—a living, adaptive system that evolves through collective learning.
