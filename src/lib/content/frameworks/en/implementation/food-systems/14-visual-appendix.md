# Food Systems & Agriculture Framework: Visual Appendix (Planned)

**In this section:**
- [Overview](#overview)
- [Sample Dashboard Mockup](#sample-dashboard-mockup)
- [Leverage Point Diagram Sketch](#leverage-point-diagram-sketch)
- [Global Risk Heatmap](#global-risk-heatmap)
- [Stakeholder Interaction Diagram](#stakeholder-interaction-diagram)
- [Summary Table](#summary-table)

The *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework* envisions a suite of visual tools to enhance accessibility, engagement, and clarity for stakeholders—farmers, indigenous communities, youth, policymakers, and private sectors. This Visual Appendix outlines planned components, including dashboards, diagrams, and tables, to be developed in future iterations. These visuals will support the framework’s [Communication and Advocacy](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#13-communication-advocacy) efforts, align with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and ensure the framework’s goals of resilient, equitable, and sustainable food systems are easily understood and actionable across diverse contexts.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The planned visual components are designed to:
- Simplify complex concepts like systemic leverage points and stakeholder roles.
- Provide real-time insights through interactive dashboards tracking Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).
- Enhance advocacy with compelling visuals like heatmaps and infographics.
- Ensure accessibility for diverse audiences, including non-technical stakeholders and marginalized groups (e.g., indigenous communities, youth).

Each visual is described as a placeholder, with details on its purpose, structure, and intended impact, to be developed in collaboration with data visualization experts and regional stakeholders.

*Accessible explanation*: Future pictures, charts, and maps will make the plan easier to understand and use for everyone.

**Alignment**: Supports SDG 17 (Partnerships for the Goals) and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP).

## <a id="sample-dashboard-mockup"></a>Sample Dashboard Mockup

![Sample Dashboard Mockup](/images/frameworks/food-systems/dashboard-mockup.svg)

**Description**: A web-based interface displaying real-time KPIs to track framework progress across regions.

**Details**:
- **Content**: Metrics include percentage of regenerative farmland (target: 30% by 2035), hunger reduction (50% by 2030), and carbon sequestration (1 gigatonne of carbon dioxide equivalent [GtCO2e] annually by 2035). Qualitative KPIs, like stakeholder trust (80% satisfaction by 2029), are shown via survey-based gauges.
- **Features**: Filters for regions (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia) and metrics (e.g., food security, biodiversity). Interactive charts show trends over time.
- **Purpose**: Enable stakeholders to monitor progress, identify gaps, and make data-driven decisions.
- **Accessibility**: Multilingual interface with plain-language tooltips and compatibility with screen readers.

**Example Use**: A policymaker in Latin America uses the dashboard to track agroforestry adoption in Brazil, adjusting funding priorities based on real-time data.

*Accessible explanation*: An online tool showing how the plan is doing, like how much farmland is greener, with easy filters for different places.

**Alignment**: Supports [Monitoring and Evaluation](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#08-implementation-mechanisms).

## <a id="leverage-point-diagram-sketch"></a>Leverage Point Diagram Sketch

![Leverage Point Diagram Sketch](/images/frameworks/food-systems/leverage-point-diagram.svg)

**Description**: A network diagram illustrating systemic leverage points and their influence on strategic objectives.

**Details**:
- **Content**: Nodes represent leverage points (subsidy redirection, knowledge commons, policy harmonization, community co-governance) connected by arrows to objectives (e.g., food security, sustainable practices).
- **Features**: Color-coded nodes highlight priority areas, with interactive hover effects explaining each leverage point’s impact (e.g., subsidy redirection scales regenerative farmland).
- **Purpose**: Clarify how targeted interventions drive systemic change, aiding systems thinking for stakeholders.
- **Accessibility**: Simple design with high-contrast colors and text descriptions for accessibility.

**Example Use**: A farmer cooperative in India visualizes how knowledge commons (e.g., peer-to-peer [P2P] platforms) boost sustainable practices, inspiring local adoption.

*Accessible explanation*: A chart showing how key actions, like sharing knowledge, lead to big changes in food systems.

**Alignment**: Supports [Systemic Leverage Points](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#09-systemic-leverage-points).

## <a id="global-risk-heatmap"></a>Global Risk Heatmap
**Description**: A heatmap highlighting key risks across regions to prioritize mitigation efforts.

**Details**:
- **Content**: Risks include climate change, geopolitical tensions, and tech dependency, mapped by severity and likelihood across regions (e.g., Sub-Saharan Africa, island nations).
- **Features**: Color gradients (e.g., red for high risk, green for low) with clickable regions linking to mitigation strategies (e.g., decentralized food hubs).
- **Purpose**: Guide stakeholders in addressing high-priority risks, fostering cross-framework synergy.
- **Accessibility**: Alt-text descriptions and audio narration for visually impaired users.

**Example Use**: A non-governmental organization (NGO) in the Maldives uses the heatmap to prioritize saltwater-tolerant crop development due to high sea-level rise risks.

*Accessible explanation*: A map showing where problems like floods or conflicts are biggest, helping focus solutions.

**Alignment**: Supports [Risk Management](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#11-risk-management).

## <a id="stakeholder-interaction-diagram"></a>Stakeholder Interaction Diagram

![Stakeholder Interaction Diagram](/images/frameworks/food-systems/stakeholder-interaction-diagram.svg)

**Description**: A diagram illustrating roles and interactions among stakeholders to enhance collaboration.

**Details**:
- **Content**: Nodes represent key actors (e.g., farmers, indigenous communities, governments, youth) with arrows showing flows of knowledge, resources, and decision-making.
- **Features**: Interactive elements highlight specific interactions (e.g., youth-led advocacy influencing policy). Annotations explain co-governance roles.
- **Purpose**: Visualize stakeholder dynamics to strengthen inclusive engagement and trust.
- **Accessibility**: High-contrast design with plain-language labels and scalable vector graphics (SVG) for zoom functionality.

**Example Use**: An indigenous leader in Peru uses the diagram to understand how their TEK contributions shape global policy decisions.

*Accessible explanation*: A picture showing how farmers, governments, and others work together, like a teamwork map.

**Alignment**: Supports [Stakeholder Engagement](/frameworks/docs/implementation/food-systems#05-stakeholder-engagement).
