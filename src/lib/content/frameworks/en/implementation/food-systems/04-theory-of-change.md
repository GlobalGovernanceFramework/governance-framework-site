The *Food Systems & Agriculture Framework* envisions a world where food systems are resilient, equitable, and sustainable, nourishing both people and the planet. The Theory of Change outlines the logical pathway to achieve this vision, connecting inputs to impact through a series of interconnected steps. By articulating how stakeholder engagement, innovative practices, and policy reforms translate into systemic transformation, this section provides a roadmap for farmers, policymakers, indigenous communities, youth, and global partners to collaboratively build a regenerative food future.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The Theory of Change maps the framework’s strategy to transform global food systems by 2035. It begins with diverse inputs, drives change through targeted activities, produces measurable outputs, leads to transformative outcomes, and culminates in a sustainable, equitable impact. This approach ensures alignment with Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), the Paris Agreement, and United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), while prioritizing inclusivity and resilience.

## <a id="inputs"></a>Inputs
Resources and foundations that fuel the framework’s implementation:
- **Stakeholder Engagement**: Collaboration among governments, farmers’ associations, indigenous communities, youth movements, non-governmental organizations (NGOs), and private sectors (e.g., agribusiness, tech firms).
- **Funding**: A $50 billion global fund, sourced from multilateral donors, carbon markets, private contributions, and reallocated national budgets, with alternative scenarios like crowdfunding and green bonds.
- **Policy Reforms**: National and global policy alignment with Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) guidelines, the Paris Agreement, and UNDRIP.
- **Technology**: Hybrid solutions combining high-tech (e.g., artificial intelligence [AI], blockchain) with low-tech (e.g., Short Message Service [SMS] alerts) and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK).
**Adaptive Pathways**: Should inputs face constraints (e.g., funding shortfalls), alternative scenarios like impact bonds or community crowdfunding activate to maintain momentum.

## <a id="activities"></a>Activities
Key actions to drive change:
- **Training**: Educate 5 million farmers and 10,000 policymakers on regenerative agriculture and TEK by 2030.
- **Pilot Projects**: Launch and scale 50 pilot projects by 2027 to demonstrate regenerative and agroecological practices.
- **Policy Advocacy**: Push for redirecting 40% of global agricultural subsidies to sustainable practices by 2030.
- **Data Monitoring**: Establish real-time data platforms with region-specific dashboards to track Key Performance Indicators (KPIs).

## <a id="feedback-mechanisms"></a>Feedback Mechanisms
The Theory of Change incorporates continuous learning through:
- Annual impact evaluations informing policy adjustments
- Real-time KPI monitoring enabling course corrections
- Community feedback loops ensuring stakeholder-driven adaptation

## <a id="outputs"></a>Outputs
Tangible results from activities:
- **Increased Regenerative Farmland**: 30% of global farmland adopts regenerative practices by 2035, starting with 5% by 2025.
- **Improved Food Access**: Local food systems reduce import dependency by 20% in vulnerable regions by 2030.
- **Equitable Trade Systems**: Fair trade certification covers 50% of global agricultural exports by 2035.
- **Knowledge Platforms**: Open-source platforms train 1 million farmers and establish 500 community-driven peer-to-peer (P2P) exchanges by 2030.

## <a id="outcomes"></a>Outcomes
Intermediate changes resulting from outputs:
- **Enhanced Food Security**: Global hunger reduced by 50% by 2030, per SDG 2 (Zero Hunger).
- **Resilient Ecosystems**: Improved soil health, biodiversity, and carbon sequestration (1 gigatonne of carbon dioxide equivalent [GtCO2e] annually by 2035).
- **Equitable Benefits**: Fair access to resources, markets, and benefits, with indigenous co-governance and youth leadership embedded in decision-making.
- **Systemic Adaptability**: Food systems withstand climate, economic, and geopolitical shocks through decentralized hubs and regional trade buffers.
- **Cultural Integration**: Traditional and modern agricultural knowledge systems harmonized, creating hybrid wisdom that respects heritage while embracing innovation.

## <a id="impact"></a>Impact
Long-term vision achieved by 2035:
- **Sustainable, Equitable, and Resilient Global Food Systems**: A world where food systems nourish all people, restore ecosystems, and foster equity, aligning with SDGs, the Paris Agreement, and UNDRIP. This impact empowers communities, preserves cultural and ecological diversity, and ensures food security for future generations.
