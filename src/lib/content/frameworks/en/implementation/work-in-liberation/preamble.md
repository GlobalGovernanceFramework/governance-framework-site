# Preamble

We were taught that work was a debt we owed for the right to exist—a clock to be punched, a wage to be earned, a soul to be sold for survival. We chained our purpose to the production line and our worth to the timecard.

But work, in its original form, is a gift. It is the weaver’s hands creating warmth, the storyteller’s voice weaving connection, the guardian’s watch over the land. It is the expression of our aliveness, our contribution to the great, breathing web of community and creation.

Let us now uncouple labor from survival and reunite it with purpose. Let us build a world where our daily efforts are acts of care, creativity, and restoration, freely chosen and joyfully given. This is our covenant: to liberate work from its chains and restore it to its sacred place as the dance of life itself.
