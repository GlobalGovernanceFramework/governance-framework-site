Monitoring and evaluation of Work in Liberation requires measurement systems that honor diverse ways of knowing while providing accountability for transformative goals. These frameworks combine quantitative tracking with qualitative assessment, Indigenous evaluation methods with contemporary social science, and community storytelling with data analysis to ensure the transformation serves life rather than statistics.

## <a id="community-wellbeing-index"></a>Community Wellbeing Index

> *"True wealth is the wellbeing of all our relations—human and more-than-human."*

**Purpose**: The Community Wellbeing Index provides comprehensive assessment of how Work in Liberation affects individual and collective flourishing, moving beyond economic indicators to measure the full spectrum of human and ecological health.

### Holistic Health Measurement

**Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI) Integration**: Primary wellbeing framework aligned with [AUBI Framework](/frameworks/aubi) measurement systems:
- **Love (Care & Relationships)** (40% weight): Quality of interpersonal relationships, community support networks, intergenerational connection, and mutual aid effectiveness
- **Meaning (Purpose & Growth)** (30% weight): Sense of purpose in work, opportunities for learning and creativity, alignment between values and daily activities
- **Connection (Human-Land Harmony)** (30% weight): Relationship with local ecosystems, participation in traditional practices, spiritual connection to place and community

**Mental Health and Stress Assessment**: Measuring psychological impacts of work transformation:
- **Work-Related Stress Reduction**: Decreased anxiety about economic security, improved work-life balance, reduced burnout and exhaustion
- **Sense of Agency**: Increased feeling of control over work choices, ability to refuse exploitative situations, participation in decision-making
- **Community Belonging**: Strengthened social connections, reduced isolation, increased trust in community support systems
- **Trauma Healing**: Recovery from work-related trauma, healing from economic violence, restoration of dignity and self-worth

**Physical Health Indicators**: Tracking health improvements from reduced work stress and increased community support:
- **Occupational Health**: Reduced workplace injuries, decreased exposure to harmful substances, improved ergonomics and safety
- **Preventive Care Access**: Increased healthcare utilization, early intervention, community health support systems
- **Lifestyle Health**: Improved sleep quality, better nutrition access, increased physical activity through community work
- **Environmental Health**: Reduced exposure to pollution, improved air and water quality from ecological restoration work

### Case Study: Community-Led Wellbeing Assessment

**Case Study: Māori-Led Wellbeing Evaluation Using Traditional and Contemporary Indicators**

In Aotearoa New Zealand's emerging BAZ, **Community Wellbeing Index** assessment integrates traditional Māori health concepts like hauora (holistic wellbeing) with contemporary indicators. **Community Work Teams** contribute to whakapapa (genealogical connections), whenua (land relationships), and whakatōhea (tribal identity) while earning **Hearts** and **Leaves** measured through both quantitative data and traditional storytelling evaluation methods.

**GGF Mechanisms in Action:**
* Community Wellbeing Index integrating Indigenous evaluation methods
* Hearts/Leaves recognition supporting traditional wellbeing concepts
* Community-controlled assessment respecting cultural protocols
* Storytelling and data integration providing holistic evaluation

**Real-World Analogue:** This scenario builds on **Māori health frameworks** like **Te Whare Tapa Whā** and wellbeing evaluation approaches used by organizations like **Te Puni Kōkiri**, demonstrating how Indigenous evaluation methodologies can provide more comprehensive and culturally appropriate assessment than Western metrics alone.

**Next Steps**: This comprehensive monitoring and evaluation framework provides accountability while honoring community sovereignty and diverse ways of knowing. Continue to [Crisis Response Protocols](/frameworks/work-in-liberation#crisis-response) to explore emergency coordination mechanisms, or access the [Community Evaluation Toolkit](/frameworks/tools/work-in-liberation/community-evaluation-toolkit.pdf) to begin implementing assessment systems in your community.

**Implementation Note**: Evaluation systems must be implemented gradually with extensive community consultation and training. Begin with simple metrics that communities find meaningful while building capacity for more sophisticated assessment over time. Always ensure evaluation serves community learning rather than external judgment or control.
