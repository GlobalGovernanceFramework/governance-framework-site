## üéØ **The Core Economic Problem**

### **Current System Costs**
- **$1.5 trillion annually**: Lost productivity from worker disengagement and exploitation
- **$6.2 trillion annually**: Environmental damage from extractive industries
- **$300 billion annually**: Platform extraction from gig workers (Uber, DoorDash, TaskRabbit take 20-30% cuts)
- **$2 trillion annually**: Unpaid care work (childcare, eldercare, community support) sustaining the economy

### **Market Failures**
- **Gig platforms**: Extract value without providing security, benefits, or democratic governance
- **Care economy**: Essential work undervalued, creating social costs and demographic crises
- **Environmental externalities**: True costs of ecological damage not reflected in prices
- **Coordination failures**: Lack of systems for organizing meaningful work at scale
