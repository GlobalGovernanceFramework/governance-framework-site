The transformation from extractive labor to Work With Purpose requires careful orchestration across a generation, balancing urgent action with sustainable development. This 25-year implementation plan provides a roadmap for systematic change that begins with pilot programs demonstrating alternative possibilities and builds toward comprehensive transformation of how humans organize productive activity globally.

## <a id="implementation-overview"></a>Implementation Overview

**Strategic Approach**: The implementation follows a three-phase model that prioritizes proving concepts through small-scale pilots, building alternative infrastructure through scaling successful approaches, and achieving system-wide transformation through global integration. Each phase builds on previous successes while adapting to changing conditions and emerging opportunities.

**Cultural Foundation**: All implementation operates under Indigenous leadership through Bioregional Autonomous Zones, ensuring traditional knowledge guides ecological work and Indigenous sovereignty remains paramount throughout the transformation process.

**Economic Integration**: Implementation coordinates closely with [AUBI Framework](/frameworks/aubi) rollout, using economic security as the foundation enabling meaningful work choice while building Hearts/Leaves economies that recognize care and ecological contributions.

**Timeline Flexibility**: While organized around 25-year vision, implementation adapts to local conditions, crisis responses, and emerging opportunities, with regular review and adjustment based on community feedback and changing global circumstances.

### Core Implementation Principles

**Start Where You Are**: Communities begin implementation with existing resources and capacities, building on successful local initiatives rather than waiting for perfect conditions or external permission.

**Indigenous Leadership**: All implementation follows Free, Prior, and Informed Consent protocols with Indigenous communities leading ecological work and maintaining sovereignty over traditional territories and knowledge systems.

**Economic Security First**: AUBI Layer 1 implementation provides the economic foundation enabling people to choose meaningful work over survival jobs, creating conditions for Community Work Team participation.

**Cultural Adaptation**: Implementation strategies adapt to local cultural contexts, governance traditions, and economic conditions while maintaining core principles of democracy, ecology, and justice.

**Crisis Integration**: Implementation plans incorporate response to economic disruption, climate emergencies, and social upheaval, using crises as opportunities for rapid transformation toward regenerative alternatives.

**Next Steps**: This implementation plan provides the roadmap for 25-year transformation from extractive labor to Work With Purpose. Continue to [Key Tools and Technologies](/frameworks/work-in-liberation#tools-technologies) to explore the practical instruments enabling this transformation, or access the [Community Work Team Starter Kit](/frameworks/tools/work-in-liberation/community-work-team-starter-kit.pdf) to begin immediate implementation in your community.

**Implementation Note**: The 25-year timeline provides strategic direction while remaining flexible enough to adapt to crisis opportunities, technological developments, and cultural evolution. Communities should begin with Phase 1 pilots while building relationships and infrastructure necessary for Phase 2 scaling, always under Indigenous leadership and with respect for traditional governance systems.
