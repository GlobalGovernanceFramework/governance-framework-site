What does victory look like when work serves life instead of exploitation? How do we measure the unmeasurable—the moment when a teenager discovers their gifts matter to the world, when an elder's wisdom finds eager young ears, when damaged land begins to breathe again under caring hands?

The outcomes we expect from Work in Liberation aren't just numbers on a dashboard, though we track those too. They're the stories communities tell about their own transformation, the changes visible in children's eyes when they see adults doing work they love, the way people move differently through their days when survival anxiety no longer drives every choice.

But revolutionary dreams without concrete targets remain fantasies. So we measure both the quantifiable and the qualitative, the statistical and the spiritual, tracking our progress toward a world where **work becomes the expression of our deepest care for life itself**.

## <a id="transformation-measuring"></a>The Transformation We're Measuring

Every measurement in this framework serves a simple question: *Are we creating conditions where human beings can offer their best gifts to the world?* The numbers matter because they represent real people finding meaningful work, real ecosystems recovering health, real communities discovering their collective power.

Consider Amara, a former Uber driver in Lagos who joins a Community Work Team organizing neighborhood food systems in **Year 3 of her BAZ's pilot program**. **Seven years later**, she's earning more through Hearts currency for nutrition education than she ever made driving strangers around the city. Her work feeds her community while teaching children about traditional Nigerian crops. When we count "25% reduction in gig platform dependency," we're counting Amara's liberation—and thousands of stories like hers.

Or think about the Menominee Nation in Wisconsin, whose traditional forestry knowledge guides a Community Work Team that's sequestered 2 million tons of carbon while providing sustainable timber and Hearts income for tribal members. When we measure "40% increase in carbon sequestration," we're measuring the healing of relationships between Indigenous communities and their territories.

**These outcomes aren't predictions—they're commitments.** Every target represents communities we refuse to abandon, ecosystems we promise to heal, young people whose futures we're determined to transform.

## <a id="quantified-planetary-healing"></a>Quantified Planetary Healing

The Earth doesn't lie. Soil either holds carbon or it doesn't. Species populations either recover or they decline. Watersheds either run clean or they carry poison. While human systems can be gamed or manipulated, ecological indicators provide unforgiving honesty about whether our work truly serves life.

### **Ecological Restoration Targets Within 20 Years**

**40% of Global Land Within GGF Ecosystem Under Regenerative Stewardship**: This means Community Work Teams managing nearly 6 billion hectares through traditional knowledge-guided restoration, regenerative agriculture, and rewilding projects. Indigenous communities lead this work, earning enhanced Leaves bonuses while healing territories colonization damaged.

*Imagine flying across continents after two decades of implementation and seeing a different world below: vast grasslands where cattle once overgrazed, forests returning to former clearcuts, wetlands filtering watersheds clean again. This isn't romantic imagination—it's what happens when millions of people earn their livelihoods through ecological restoration rather than extraction.*

**60% Increase in Biodiversity in Managed Areas**: Species recovery becomes the measure of successful work. Community Work Teams track wildlife populations, pollinator networks, and ecosystem health as core job performance indicators. The **Green Job Score** rewards work that demonstrably increases life abundance.

**2 Billion Tons Annual Carbon Sequestration**: Through Community Work Teams managing forest restoration, regenerative agriculture, wetland creation, and soil building projects. This represents removing atmospheric carbon equivalent to shutting down 500 coal plants—but through work that creates abundance rather than scarcity.

**80% Reduction in Agricultural Chemical Use**: As Community Work Teams transition farming systems to ecological methods combining traditional knowledge with contemporary organic practices. This work earns both Leaves for ecological impact and Hearts for food system transformation.

### **Climate Resilience Achievement**

**50 Million Climate Refugees Successfully Integrated Within 15 Years**: Climate displacement becomes an opportunity for community building rather than crisis. **Climate Migration Work Teams** organize settlement support, housing construction, and economic integration through Community Work Teams, turning climate trauma into community resilience.

**75% Reduction in Climate-Related Economic Losses**: Compared to business-as-usual scenarios, communities practicing Work in Liberation suffer dramatically less economic disruption during climate events because their economies prioritize resilience over efficiency, community wealth over individual accumulation.

**1000 Climate-Resilient Communities Within 20 Years**: Urban and rural areas where Community Work Teams have transformed infrastructure for climate adaptation—urban forests, food systems, renewable energy, flood management—all organized through democratic work coordination earning Hearts and Leaves.

### **Regenerative Technology Integration**

**90% Renewable Energy in BAZ Territories**: Community-owned renewable systems installed and maintained by Community Work Teams, ensuring energy democracy accompanies energy transition. Workers earn Leaves for clean energy work while communities control their power infrastructure.

**Zero Waste Achievement in 500 Communities**: Through Community Work Teams organizing repair, reuse, composting, and circular economy systems. This work earns Hearts for community service while eliminating the waste that capitalism treats as inevitable.

## <a id="community-flourishing"></a>Community Flourishing Indicators

Numbers can capture scale, but they struggle with depth. How do you quantify the moment when a community discovers it can take care of itself? How do you measure the relief in a parent's voice when they realize their child will grow up with meaningful work available? How do you count the restoration of dignity?

### **Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI) Transformation**

**50% Increase in Global LMCI Scores Within 20 Years**: This represents the single most important outcome—measurable improvement in human flourishing across love (relationships and care), meaning (purpose and growth), and connection (human-land harmony).

*Picture the grandmother in rural Bangladesh whose traditional weaving knowledge suddenly becomes valuable again through Hearts recognition, connecting her with young people eager to learn while providing income that honors her expertise. Her LMCI score captures not just her individual wellbeing but the community's renewed appreciation for elder wisdom.*

**85% Reduction in Work-Related Mental Health Issues**: As survival anxiety decreases through AUBI Layer 1 and work becomes voluntary contribution rather than coerced labor. Community mental health workers—themselves earning Hearts for care work—track depression, anxiety, and burnout rates.

**70% Increase in Intergenerational Connection**: Measured through elder-youth partnership participation, traditional knowledge transmission rates, and community storytelling activities. Work in Liberation creates natural bridges between generations through shared meaningful work.

### **Community Self-Reliance Growth**

**80% Local Food Security Achievement**: Communities meet 80% of their food needs through local Community Work Teams organizing urban agriculture, traditional farming, and food distribution systems. This work earns both Hearts for community service and Leaves for ecological impact.

**90% Community Tool and Skill Availability**: Essential tools, equipment, and expertise available within local community networks rather than dependent on corporate supply chains. **Community Tool Libraries** and **Skills Resonance Matching** eliminate artificial scarcity.

**95% Community Crisis Response Capacity**: Local communities can respond effectively to economic, health, or environmental emergencies through established Community Work Teams and mutual aid networks, reducing dependence on external disaster response.

### **Social Cohesion and Trust Building**

**60% Increase in Community Participation**: More people engaged in local decision-making, cultural activities, and mutual aid as economic security through AUBI enables community involvement rather than survival focus.

**75% Reduction in Community Conflict**: As economic stress decreases and restorative justice practices (via Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework) replace punitive approaches to community problems. Conflict becomes opportunity for deeper understanding rather than division.

**40% Increase in Cross-Cultural Cooperation**: Measured through inter-community project collaboration, cultural exchange programs, and successful conflict resolution between different cultural groups within bioregions.

## <a id="economic-justice"></a>Economic Justice Achievements

The most powerful outcome of Work in Liberation isn't just that everyone has work—it's that everyone has work that honors their humanity while serving life. Economic justice means both material security and meaningful contribution, both individual dignity and collective flourishing.

### **Inequality Transformation Within 20 Years**

**60% Reduction in Global Gini Coefficient**: Representing the most dramatic decrease in inequality in human history, achieved through AUBI foundation plus Hearts/Leaves recognition for essential work currently unpaid or undervalued.

*Consider what this means concretely: Today, a corporate CEO might earn 400 times more than their average worker. Within two decades of implementation, this ratio drops to 15:1 as care work, ecological restoration, and community organizing earn significant Hearts/Leaves income while excessive accumulation becomes culturally unacceptable and economically unnecessary.*

**90% Elimination of Absolute Poverty**: Through AUBI Layer 1 providing unconditional basic income plus Community Work Team opportunities for additional Hearts/Leaves income. Poverty becomes a policy choice we refuse to make rather than an inevitable condition.

**25% Increase in Community Wealth Retention**: Money earned locally stays local through Hearts/Leaves circulation, Community Work Team coordination, and cooperative business development, rather than extracting to distant corporate shareholders.

### **Alternative Currency Adoption**

**50% of Local Transactions in Hearts/Leaves Within 15 Years**: Alternative currencies become mainstream for community services, local business, and mutual aid, reducing dependence on corporate-controlled financial systems while recognizing care and ecological work.

**$2 Trillion Global Hearts/Leaves Economy**: Representing a parallel economy that values care, creativity, and ecological restoration rather than extraction and accumulation. This economy operates through cooperation rather than competition.

**80% Community Business Conversion to Cooperative Models**: Worker-owned enterprises become the norm rather than the exception, ensuring economic democracy accompanies Work in Liberation implementation.

### **Financial Security Transformation**

**95% Population Covered by AUBI Within 25 Years**: Universal access to economic security as a human right, with Layer 1 providing unconditional foundation and Layers 2/3 rewarding meaningful contributions through Hearts/Leaves bonuses.

**75% Reduction in Financial Stress**: Measured through community health surveys, mental health indicators, and family stability metrics as economic security enables focus on contribution rather than survival.

**40% Increase in Economic Mobility**: Particularly for historically marginalized communities who gain access to meaningful work opportunities through Community Work Teams while receiving recognition for cultural knowledge and community contributions.

## <a id="cultural-renaissance"></a>Cultural Renaissance Outcomes

When people no longer spend their days doing meaningless work just to survive, what do they create? When elder wisdom receives economic recognition alongside youth innovation, what knowledge emerges? When traditional skills become valued economic activities, which cultures flourish?

Work in Liberation expects to catalyze the greatest cultural renaissance in human history—not through top-down cultural policy, but by creating economic conditions where human creativity and cultural wisdom can flourish.

### **Indigenous Cultural Revitalization**

**100 Indigenous Languages Revitalized Within 10 Years**: As language preservation and transmission becomes economically valued work through Hearts recognition. Elders earn income teaching languages while young people learn cultural knowledge through Community Work Teams organized around traditional activities.

*Picture the Inuktitut language growing stronger each year as young people in Nunavut join Community Work Teams that operate entirely in traditional language—managing caribou migration, preserving traditional knowledge, organizing community activities. When language becomes the medium for meaningful, well-compensated work, it lives and grows.*

**500 Traditional Knowledge Documentation Projects**: Community-controlled efforts to preserve, apply, and transmit traditional ecological knowledge, healing practices, governance wisdom, and artistic traditions. This work earns Hearts while ensuring cultural survival and evolution.

**80% of Sacred Sites Under Indigenous Protection**: Through Community Work Teams organized around sacred site stewardship, earning Leaves for ecological protection while maintaining spiritual and cultural protocols.

### **Community Arts and Expression Flourishing**

**200% Increase in Community-Created Media**: As people have time and economic security to pursue artistic expression while earning Hearts for cultural work. Community radio, local music, storytelling, and visual arts flourish when survival pressure decreases.

**90% Communities with Regular Cultural Celebrations**: Seasonal festivals, cultural exchanges, and community gatherings become regular features of community life as people have time and energy for collective joy and meaning-making.

**50% Increase in Cross-Cultural Artistic Collaboration**: Respectful cultural exchange and artistic fusion as different communities work together on shared projects while maintaining cultural sovereignty and preventing appropriation.

### **Traditional Skills and Crafts Renaissance**

**300% Increase in Traditional Craft Production**: As traditional skills become economically viable through Hearts/Leaves recognition and community demand for locally-made, culturally significant goods rather than mass-produced commodities.

**80% Youth Participation in Traditional Learning**: Young people learn traditional skills through elder mentorship in Community Work Teams, creating intergenerational bonds while preserving cultural knowledge and earning income.

**1000 Community Workshop Spaces**: Tool libraries, maker spaces, and traditional craft centers where communities maintain the skills needed for self-reliance while creating beautiful, meaningful objects.

## <a id="democratic-participation"></a>Democratic Participation Expansion

Work in Liberation doesn't just change what people do for income—it transforms how communities make decisions about their collective future. When work becomes democratic through Community Work Teams, democracy extends beyond elections into daily life.

### **Community Self-Governance Growth**

**75% Population Participating in Local Democracy Within 15 Years**: Regular involvement in community assemblies, work team coordination, and resource allocation decisions as economic security through AUBI enables civic participation rather than survival focus.

**500 Youth Councils with Binding Authority**: Young people exercise real decision-making power over long-term community decisions rather than token consultation, ensuring intergenerational justice in community planning.

**90% Communities Using Consensus Decision-Making**: For major decisions affecting community welfare, moving beyond majority rule toward collective wisdom and shared responsibility for outcomes.

### **Economic Democracy Achievement**

**60% Workplaces Democratically Controlled Within 20 Years**: Through Community Work Team expansion and Cooperative Conversion programs, most people work in democratically governed organizations rather than hierarchical corporations.

**80% Community Control Over Local Resources**: Community assemblies make decisions about local resource allocation, development projects, and economic priorities rather than external corporate or government control.

**40% Participation in Regional Bioregional Autonomous Zone Governance**: People actively engaged in bioregional decision-making about watershed management, ecological restoration, and inter-community coordination.

### **Global Democratic Coordination**

**50 Countries with Fractal Labor Parliament Representation Within 15 Years**: National and sub-national participation in global work coordination while maintaining local autonomy and cultural sovereignty.

**200 Sister City Relationships Between BAZs**: International solidarity and mutual learning between communities implementing Work in Liberation, creating global networks of support and innovation sharing.

**Global Indigenous Council Recognition**: Indigenous communities acknowledged as authorities on ecological and governance matters in international decision-making, not just consultation subjects.

## <a id="global-movement"></a>Global Movement Coordination

These outcomes don't emerge in isolation—they're the result of coordinated global movement building that respects local autonomy while enabling mutual support and learning. The transformation happens simultaneously at all scales: individual, community, bioregional, and planetary.

### **Movement Network Development**

**10,000 Trained Community Weavers Within 10 Years**: Skilled facilitators supporting Community Work Team development, AUBI integration, and democratic participation across all continents, ensuring high-quality implementation while respecting cultural diversity.

**100 Regional Implementation Hubs**: Centers providing technical assistance, training, and coordination support for communities implementing Work in Liberation principles while adapting to local contexts and governance traditions.

**Global Solidarity Network**: Mutual aid and resource sharing between communities implementing Work in Liberation, enabling rapid support during crises and sharing of innovations across cultures and bioregions.

### **Policy and Legal Transformation**

**25 Countries with AUBI Implementation Within 15 Years**: National policies providing unconditional basic income as foundation for Work in Liberation implementation, demonstrating scalability across different political and economic systems.

**Indigenous Rights Legal Victories**: Treaty recognition, land rematriation, and traditional governance authority acknowledgment providing foundation for BAZ development and Indigenous-led Community Work Teams.

**Corporate Accountability Legislation**: Legal requirements for automation taxes, worker transition support, and community benefit contributions funding AUBI and Community Work Team development.

### **Educational and Cultural Integration**

**500 Universities Teaching Work in Liberation Principles**: Academic integration ensuring next generation learns democratic work organization, ecological stewardship, and community economics as normal rather than radical approaches.

**Community Education Programs**: Local learning opportunities for all ages in Community Work Team organization, consensus decision-making, ecological restoration, and traditional knowledge application.

**Global Media Network**: Community-controlled media sharing stories, innovations, and support across Work in Liberation communities worldwide, countering corporate media narratives about work and economic possibility.

## <a id="metrics-liberation"></a>The Metrics of Liberation

How do you measure freedom? How do you quantify the moment when a community realizes it can take care of itself? How do you count the restoration of human dignity?

Our metrics balance the quantifiable with the qualitative, the immediate with the long-term, the individual with the collective. Every number represents real people finding meaningful work, real communities healing relationships, real ecosystems recovering life.

### **Integrated Success Measurement**

**The Liberation Index**: Combining LMCI scores, ecological health indicators, economic justice metrics, and democratic participation rates into a comprehensive measure of community flourishing that goes far beyond GDP or other conventional economic indicators.

**Community Storytelling Assessment**: Regular collection and sharing of community stories about transformation impacts, challenges, and innovations, ensuring quantitative data connects to lived experience and cultural meaning.

**Seven-Generation Impact Evaluation**: Long-term assessment of whether Work in Liberation decisions serve future generations, incorporating Indigenous planning horizons and intergenerational accountability into outcome measurement.

### **Failure Recognition and Learning**

**Honest Failure Documentation**: Not every Community Work Team succeeds, not every Hearts/Leaves program works perfectly, not every community assembly reaches good decisions. We track failures as carefully as successes, learning from what doesn't work to improve what does.

**Elite Capture Prevention Success**: Measurement of how effectively communities maintain democratic control over Work in Liberation implementation, preventing wealthy or powerful interests from co-opting community work for private benefit.

**Cultural Integrity Protection**: Assessment of whether Work in Liberation strengthens or weakens traditional governance systems, cultural practices, and Indigenous sovereignty, with community authority to modify or withdraw from programs that cause cultural harm.

## **Looking Forward: The World We're Building**

Within a generation, a child born anywhere on Earth will grow up expecting work to be meaningful, communities to be self-governing, and economies to serve life rather than exploit it. They'll learn traditional knowledge alongside contemporary skills, participate in community decisions from an early age, and understand ecological restoration as normal human activity.

This child will earn their first Hearts at age 16 for teaching younger children, their first Leaves for helping restore a local wetland, their first taste of democracy through Community Work Team coordination. They'll never know survival anxiety because AUBI will ensure basic security from birth. They'll never accept meaningless work because they'll see adults around them doing work they love and communities flourishing through mutual aid.

The numbers in this section—the percentages and targets and metrics—they're all just ways of counting the children who will grow up free, the communities that will discover their power, the ecosystems that will remember how to breathe.

*This is what we're measuring: the healing of the world, one relationship at a time, one Community Work Team at a time, one Heart and Leaf at a time.*

*The outcomes we expect aren't just statistics—they're promises we make to each other, to the children not yet born, to the more-than-human world that sustains all life. Every target is a commitment, every metric a covenant, every measurement a love letter to the future we refuse to abandon.*
