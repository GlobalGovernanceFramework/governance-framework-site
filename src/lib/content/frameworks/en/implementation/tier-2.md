## Tier 2: The Foundational Application Layer

With the core operating systems established in Tier 1, this tier represents the essential "applications" needed to run a healthy society on a thriving planet. These frameworks govern the foundational systems for ecological well-being (e.g., `Kinship Garden`, `Planetary Health`, `Water & Sanitation`) and human capability (e.g., `Educational Systems`, `Global Health`).
