# Technical Infrastructure: Community-Controlled Technology

> *"Technology is not neutral—it either serves community sovereignty or corporate extraction. When we build Hearts systems with Indigenous-controlled nodes and democratic governance, we prove that code can be ceremony, algorithms can honor ancestors, and blockchain can strengthen rather than replace the sacred relationships that sustain life."*

*In Kerala, India, the state government created a digital infrastructure serving 35 million people through community-controlled systems that prioritize local needs over corporate profit. Their approach demonstrates how technology can serve democratic governance rather than surveillance capitalism. Local self-government institutions control data and decision-making while citizens access services through multiple channels including mobile apps, community centers, and offline systems that ensure universal access regardless of economic status or technological capacity.*

*Kerala's success emerges from treating technology as public infrastructure rather than private property, ensuring democratic control over essential systems rather than dependence on corporate platforms that extract value while providing services. Hearts and Leaves technical infrastructure learns from Kerala's model while extending democratic technology principles to community-controlled economic systems that serve sovereignty rather than surveillance.*

## <a id="infrastructure-philosophy"></a>Infrastructure Philosophy: Code as Ceremony

Hearts and Leaves technical infrastructure operates through principles that treat code development as ceremony—sacred work that honors community relationships while building tools for collective liberation rather than individual profit.

### Community Sovereignty Over Corporate Control

**Democratic Technology Development**: All Hearts and Leaves code development follows community priorities determined through democratic governance rather than corporate product roadmaps designed to maximize user engagement and data extraction for advertising revenue or investor returns.
