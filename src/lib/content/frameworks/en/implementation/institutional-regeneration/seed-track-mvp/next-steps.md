## Next Steps: Expanding Beyond Seed Track

Once Seed Track implementation is successful (typically 6-12 months), organizations can:

1. **Apply for GCF Bronze-tier funding** using Seed Track results as evidence
2. **Join Community of Practice** to share experiences and learn from peers
3. **Expand to full framework modules** based on increased capacity and confidence
4. **Mentor other organizations** interested in Seed Track implementation

The Seed Track serves as both a standalone improvement program and a stepping stone to full institutional regeneration, ensuring that even the smallest organizations can participate in the planetary transformation toward regenerative governance.
