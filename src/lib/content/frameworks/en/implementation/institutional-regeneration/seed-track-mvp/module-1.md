## Module 1: Purpose & Mandate Audit (Seed Track)

### 1.1 Mandate Relevance Protocol (Simplified)

**Purpose**: Rapidly assess whether your institution's current mandate serves 21st-century planetary needs.

**Process** (2-4 weeks):

#### Step 1: Polycrisis Alignment Check (1 week)
**Tool**: Simple scoring matrix evaluating mandate against five polycrisis domains:
- **Climate & Ecological Breakdown** (0-4 points)
- **Social Inequality & Justice** (0-4 points) 
- **Democratic Legitimacy Crisis** (0-4 points)
- **Technological Disruption** (0-4 points)
- **Economic System Breakdown** (0-4 points)

**Scoring Questions** (for each domain):
- Does our mandate directly address this challenge? (4 points)
- Does our mandate indirectly support solutions? (2 points)
- Is our mandate neutral/unrelated? (1 point)
- Does our mandate potentially worsen this challenge? (0 points)

**Interpretation**:
- **16-20 points**: High relevance, focus on effectiveness improvements
- **10-15 points**: Moderate relevance, consider mandate expansion
- **Below 10 points**: Significant mandate refresh needed

#### Step 2: Stakeholder Reality Check (1 week)
**Process**: Survey 15-20 key stakeholders using three simple questions:
1. "What's the most important challenge our institution should address in the next 5 years?"
2. "How well is our institution currently positioned to address this? (1-10 scale)"
3. "What's one change that would dramatically improve our effectiveness?"

**Analysis**: Look for patterns in responses. If stakeholder priorities significantly diverge from current activities, mandate adjustment is needed.

#### Step 3: Relevance Score Calculation
Combine polycrisis score (70% weight) with stakeholder alignment score (30% weight) for overall Mandate Relevance Score.

### 1.2 Purpose Clarification Process (Simplified)

**Purpose**: Develop a clear, actionable purpose statement through structured dialogue.

**Process** (1-2 weeks):

#### Single-Session Purpose Workshop (4 hours)
**Participants**: 
- Core leadership team (3-5 people)
- Representative stakeholders (5-10 people)
- External facilitator (recommended)

**Workshop Structure**:

**Hour 1: Context Setting**
- Present polycrisis alignment results
- Share stakeholder feedback themes
- Acknowledge current mandate limitations

**Hour 2: Purpose Exploration**
Use the "Three Horizons" framework:
- **Horizon 1**: What are we good at now?
- **Horizon 2**: What's emerging that we should engage?
- **Horizon 3**: What regenerative future do we want to help create?

**Hour 3: Purpose Drafting**
Collaborative writing using this template:
> "We exist to [core function] so that [desired outcome] enabling [planetary vision]."

Example: "We exist to facilitate regional trade cooperation so that communities can prosper within ecological limits, enabling a regenerative global economy."

**Hour 4: Validation & Commitment**
- Test purpose against stakeholder priorities
- Identify 2-3 concrete changes needed to align with new purpose
- Secure leadership commitment to 6-month pilot implementation

### 1.3 Reform Pacing Diagnostic

**Purpose**: Determine optimal speed of change for your institution's culture and capacity.

**Assessment Tool** (30 minutes):
Rate your institution on 5 dimensions (1-5 scale):

1. **Leadership Change Appetite**
   - 5: Actively seeking transformation
   - 3: Open to moderate change
   - 1: Highly risk-averse

2. **Staff Innovation Culture**
   - 5: Staff regularly propose improvements
   - 3: Staff engage when asked
   - 1: Staff prefer status quo

3. **External Pressure for Change**
   - 5: Stakeholders demanding reform
   - 3: Mixed external feedback
   - 1: External satisfaction with current approach

4. **Resource Availability**
   - 5: Budget/time available for change initiatives
   - 3: Limited but sufficient resources
   - 1: Stretched thin, no spare capacity

5. **Recent Change Experience**
   - 5: Successfully implemented recent changes
   - 3: Mixed success with past changes
   - 1: Previous change efforts failed

**Pacing Recommendations**:
- **20-25 points**: Fast track (6-month full implementation)
- **15-19 points**: Standard pace (12-month implementation)
- **10-14 points**: Gradual approach (18-month implementation)
- **Below 10 points**: Intensive preparation phase needed before beginning
