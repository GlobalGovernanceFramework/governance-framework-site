## 12.1 Glossary of Terms üìñ

To promote clear communication and shared understanding, this glossary defines key terms used throughout the framework:

**Build Back Better**: Approach to recovery that integrates disaster risk reduction measures and improves physical, social, economic, and environmental conditions beyond pre-disaster levels.

**Climate Adaptation**: Adjustment in natural or human systems in response to actual or expected climate stimuli or their effects, which moderates harm or exploits beneficial opportunities.

**Community-Based Disaster Risk Management (CBDRM)**: Approach that empowers communities to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters through participatory risk assessment, planning, and implementation.

**Disaster Risk Reduction (DRR)**: Concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through systematic efforts to analyze and manage causal factors, including reduced exposure to hazards, lessened vulnerability of people and property, wise management of land and environment, and improved preparedness for adverse events.

**Early Warning System (EWS)**: Integrated system of hazard monitoring, forecasting, risk assessment, communication, and preparedness activities that enables individuals, communities, and organizations threatened by hazards to prepare for and respond effectively.

**Ecosystem-Based Adaptation (EbA)**: Use of biodiversity and ecosystem services as part of an overall adaptation strategy to help people adapt to the adverse effects of climate change and reduce disaster risk.

**Exposure**: People, property, systems, or other elements present in hazard zones that are subject to potential losses.

**Forecast-based Financing**: Mechanism that automatically releases funding for predetermined actions when specific forecast thresholds are triggered, enabling anticipatory action before disaster impacts occur.

**Hazard**: Potentially damaging physical event, phenomenon, or human activity that may cause loss of life, injury, property damage, social and economic disruption, or environmental degradation.

**Inclusion**: Active engagement of marginalized groups‚Äîincluding women, persons with disabilities, Indigenous communities, youth, and elders‚Äîin all phases of disaster management, recognizing their unique needs and capacities.

**Mitigation**: Lessening or limitation of the adverse impacts of hazards and related disasters, often focusing on structural measures such as infrastructure reinforcement and non-structural measures such as building codes.

**Parametric Insurance**: Insurance contract that makes a payout upon the occurrence of a triggering event, based on predetermined parameters such as wind speed or rainfall amount, rather than assessment of actual losses.

**Preparedness**: Knowledge and capacities developed by governments, response organizations, communities, and individuals to effectively anticipate, respond to, and recover from the impacts of likely, imminent, or current hazard events or conditions.

**Prevention**: Activities and measures to avoid existing and new disaster risks, focusing on averting potential adverse impacts through actions taken in advance.

**Recovery**: Restoration and improvement of facilities, livelihoods, and living conditions of disaster-affected communities, including efforts to reduce disaster risk factors.

**Resilience**: Ability of a system, community, or society exposed to hazards to resist, absorb, accommodate to, and recover from the effects of a hazard in a timely and efficient manner, including through the preservation and restoration of its essential basic structures and functions.

**Risk Assessment**: Methodology to determine the nature and extent of risk by analyzing potential hazards and evaluating existing conditions of vulnerability that together could potentially harm exposed people, property, services, livelihoods, and the environment.

**Sendai Framework**: Global agreement adopted at the Third UN World Conference on Disaster Risk Reduction in Sendai, Japan (2015-2030), outlining seven targets and four priorities for action to prevent new and reduce existing disaster risks.

**Vulnerability**: Characteristics and circumstances of a community, system, or asset that make it susceptible to the damaging effects of a hazard, shaped by physical, social, economic, and environmental factors.

## 12.2 Case Studies üîç
