# Monitoring, Evaluation, and Iteration 📊

The Disaster Risk Reduction & Resilience (DRR&R) Implementation Framework embraces continuous learning and adaptive management through robust monitoring, evaluation, and iteration processes that center Traditional Ecological Knowledge, Indigenous sovereignty, and community-controlled assessment while utilizing Golden Triangle ecosystem mechanisms. This section outlines approaches for tracking progress, measuring impact, and refining implementation based on Traditional knowledge evidence, Indigenous community feedback, and regenerative outcomes that strengthen rather than extract from Traditional territories and Traditional knowledge systems.

By establishing monitoring systems that respect Indigenous protocols while enabling rigorous evaluation, the framework ensures accountability to Indigenous communities while supporting contextual adaptation and evolution guided by Traditional knowledge keepers and Traditional governance systems. This commitment to Traditional knowledge-centered iterative improvement aligns with the guiding principles of Indigenous authority, Traditional knowledge protection, and regenerative approaches that serve Traditional territories and Traditional knowledge systems.
