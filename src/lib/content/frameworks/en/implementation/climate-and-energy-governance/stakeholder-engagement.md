Effective climate and energy governance requires the meaningful participation of diverse stakeholders, but within a fundamentally transformed power structure that centers Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and community control. Operating through the institutional authority of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and coordinated through the [Integrated Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance), this framework moves beyond consultation to genuine power redistribution and Indigenous leadership.
