### <a id="equity-metrics"></a>Equity Metrics

**Primary Target: 90% of nations meet development/resilience benchmarks**

This target ensures that climate action advances rather than hinders sustainable development and addresses historical inequities.

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- **Climate Finance Flows:** $500 billion annually by 2030, $1 trillion by 2040, with at least 50% directed to adaptation in vulnerable nations
- **Climate Justice Index:** Composite measure tracking distributional, procedural, and recognition aspects of climate justice

- **Just Transition Implementation:** 80% of affected fossil fuel workers and communities supported through transition programs by 2035
- **Climate-Resilient Development:** 90% of nations implementing climate-resilient development pathways by 2040

**Measurement Approaches:**
- Annual equity assessment reports from the Global Oversight Body
- Independent audits of climate finance flows and distribution
- Standardized reporting on technology transfer and capacity building
- Community-based monitoring of just transition outcomes
- Integration with SDG monitoring frameworks

### <a id="adaptation-metrics"></a>Adaptation Metrics

**Primary Target: 75% of vulnerable communities climate-resilient by 2035; 100% by 2040**

This target focuses on building resilience in communities most at risk, including low-lying coastal zones, arid regions, and small island states.

**Key Performance Indicators:**
- **National Adaptation Plans:** 100% of vulnerable nations with funded implementation plans by 2030
- **Critical Infrastructure Resilience:** 80% of essential infrastructure (water, energy, healthcare, transport) climate-proofed by 2035
- **Early Warning Systems:** Universal coverage (100% of population) with multi-hazard early warning systems by 2030

### <a id="integrated-reporting-framework"></a>Integrated Reporting Framework

To ensure coherent tracking of these metrics, an Integrated Climate Metrics System (ICMS) will be established under the Global Oversight Body. This system will:

- **Synchronize Reporting Cycles:** Align with 5-year Global Stocktake process
- **Provide Transparency:** Make all metrics publicly accessible through digital dashboards
- **Ensure Independence:** Undergo regular third-party verification
- **Enable Adaptation:** Include mechanisms to update metrics as science evolves
- **Support Decision-Making:** Connect metrics directly to governance decisions and financial allocations

### <a id="subnational"></a>Subnational and Non-State Actor Contributions

Beyond national targets, the framework will track contributions from:
- Cities and subnational regions
- Corporate actors and industry alliances
- Civil society initiatives
- Financial institutions

These non-state contributions will be formally recognized in the metrics system, with standardized methodologies for aggregating their impacts alongside national efforts.

### <a id="periodic-review-and-enhancement"></a>Periodic Review and Enhancement

Metrics will undergo formal review every five years to:
- Assess adequacy against latest scientific findings
- Identify implementation gaps
- Update targets based on technological developments
- Incorporate emerging measurement approaches
- Strengthen accountability mechanisms

This review process will engage diverse stakeholders, including scientific bodies, affected communities, and implementation partners, ensuring the metrics remain relevant, ambitious, and achievable.
