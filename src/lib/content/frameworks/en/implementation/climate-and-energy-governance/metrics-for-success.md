## Metrics for Success

**In this section:**
- [Integrated Measurement Framework](#integrated-measurement-framework)
- [Indigenous Sovereignty and Cultural Vitality Metrics](#indigenous-sovereignty-cultural-vitality-metrics)
- [Climate and Ecosystem Regeneration Metrics](#climate-ecosystem-regeneration-metrics)
- [Community Economic Justice Metrics](#community-economic-justice-metrics)
- [Energy Democracy and Technology Sovereignty Metrics](#energy-democracy-technology-sovereignty-metrics)
- [Youth Leadership and Intergenerational Justice Metrics](#youth-leadership-intergenerational-justice-metrics)
- [Meta-Governance Coordination Effectiveness Metrics](#meta-governance-coordination-effectiveness-metrics)
- [Comprehensive Evaluation and Adaptive Management](#comprehensive-evaluation-adaptive-management)

Effective climate and energy governance requires comprehensive measurement systems that track progress across multiple dimensions while centering Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and community control. Operating through the institutional mechanisms of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and coordinated through the [Integrated Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance), these metrics ensure accountability, guide adaptive management, and demonstrate the effectiveness of Indigenous-led planetary transformation.

### Foundation in Indigenous Knowledge and Community Control

**Traditional Ecological Knowledge as Primary Indicator System**: Success measured primarily through Indigenous environmental indicators, traditional observations of ecosystem health, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge assessments of climate and energy system effectiveness.

**Community-Controlled Evaluation**: Indigenous communities and frontline populations control evaluation processes within [Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components), ensuring metrics serve community needs rather than external accountability requirements.

**Seven-Generation Impact Assessment**: All success metrics evaluated across seven generations using traditional knowledge and youth council oversight, ensuring short-term gains don't compromise long-term sustainability.

**[Rights of Nature](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#core-principles) Health Indicators**: Ecosystem health and well-being measured as primary success indicators, treating forests, rivers, wetlands, and other beings as subjects with inherent rights rather than objects to be managed.

### Integration Across the Golden Triangle

**Treaty-Enabled Measurement Authority**: Metrics tracked through Treaty institutional mechanisms including the Global Carbon Levy revenue tracking, Global Enforcement Mechanism accountability measures, and enhanced democratic participation through Global Citizens' Initiative evaluation.

**[7-Dimension Meta-Governance Assessment](/frameworks/meta-governance#evaluation)**: Success evaluated across coordination effectiveness, cultural integration, planetary health, intergenerational justice, participation legitimacy, adaptability, and crisis response using Meta-Governance evaluation protocols.

**Earth Council Wisdom Integration**: The [Earth Council (Kawsay Pacha)](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) provides spiritual and ethical evaluation of success, ensuring metrics align with Indigenous values and traditional wisdom about sustainable relationships with ecosystems.

**Real-Time Community Accountability**: Metrics tracked through community-controlled monitoring systems with immediate feedback loops enabling rapid adaptation based on Traditional Ecological Knowledge observations and community evaluation.
