### <a id="purpose-and-context"></a>Purpose and Context

The climate crisis represents humanity's most urgent collective challenge, threatening ecosystems, economies, and communities worldwide. Despite three decades of international climate negotiations since the establishment of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), greenhouse gas emissions continue to rise, and global temperatures are on track to exceed dangerous thresholds. Meanwhile, global energy systems—responsible for approximately two-thirds of emissions—remain heavily dependent on fossil fuels despite the rapidly falling costs of clean alternatives.

This reality demands not just another climate framework, but a fundamental transformation in how we govern planetary systems. The Climate & Energy Governance Framework operates as a specialized implementation pathway within a broader ecosystem of transformative governance mechanisms, working in coordination with institutional reforms, Indigenous wisdom, and meta-governance protocols to address the climate crisis with unprecedented effectiveness and justice.

### <a id="framework-position-within-the-golden-triangle"></a>Framework Position within the Golden Triangle

This Climate & Energy Governance Framework is designed and operates through the institutional architecture of the **[Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home)**, is guided by the wisdom and sovereignty of the **[Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge)**, and utilizes the coordination protocols of the **[Integrated Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance)**—together forming the "Golden Triangle" of our governance ecosystem.

#### Institutional Foundation: Treaty for Our Only Home

The framework's implementation mechanisms are embedded within the Treaty's institutional architecture:

- **Funding Authority**: The [Global Carbon Levy and Financial Transaction Tax](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) (Pillar 4) provides independent funding streams of $500+ billion annually for climate mitigation, adaptation, and just transition programs
- **Legal Enforcement**: The [Global Enforcement Mechanism](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) (Pillar 3) prosecutes international environmental crimes, including ecocide, ensuring accountability for climate and ecological destruction
- **Democratic Legitimacy**: The [Global Citizens' Initiative](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) (Pillar 2) enables binding referendums on major climate policies, ensuring public participation transcends national boundaries
- **Emergency Response**: Reformed intergovernmental bodies (Pillar 1) enable rapid coordinated response to climate emergencies without traditional diplomatic deadlock

#### Wisdom Foundation: Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Leadership

Indigenous peoples and Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK) are positioned as primary architects rather than consultants in climate governance:

- **Knowledge Authority**: [Traditional Ecological Knowledge](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#key-mechanisms) serves as a foundational data source for climate modeling, adaptation strategies, and ecosystem management, with AI systems trained on TEK from 1,000+ Indigenous communities
- **Territorial Sovereignty**: [Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) provide the geographical framework for climate action, prioritizing Indigenous-led energy sovereignty and ecosystem stewardship
- **Legal Innovation**: [Rights of Nature](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#core-principles) principles treat carbon sinks like forests, wetlands, and oceans as living entities with legal rights, fundamentally shifting from property-based to relationship-based climate governance
- **Moral Authority**: The [Earth Council (Kawsay Pacha)](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) provides spiritual and ethical guidance for planetary climate stewardship, centering seventh-generation accountability

#### Coordination Architecture: Meta-Governance Integration

The framework operates through sophisticated coordination mechanisms that bridge scales and domains:

- **Specialized Coordination**: A dedicated [Climate & Energy Meta-Council](/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components) coordinates across governance domains while reporting to the Earth Council for ethical oversight
- **Comprehensive Evaluation**: The [7-Dimension Evaluation Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance#evaluation) measures success across Coordination Effectiveness, Cultural Integration, Planetary Health, and Intergenerational Justice
- **Crisis Protocols**: [24-hour emergency response mechanisms](/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components) enable rapid coordinated action during acute climate disasters and tipping point activations
- **Power Balance**: [Equity safeguards](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) prevent capture by fossil fuel interests while ensuring youth and Indigenous communities have decision-making authority

### <a id="scope-and-vision"></a>Scope and Vision

Operating within this integrated governance ecosystem, this framework addresses the full spectrum of climate and energy transformation needs:

- **Climate Mitigation**: Reducing greenhouse gas emissions across all sectors through Indigenous-led ecosystem restoration and renewable energy deployment
- **Climate Adaptation**: Building resilience to unavoidable climate impacts using Traditional Ecological Knowledge and community-controlled adaptation strategies
- **Energy Systems Transformation**: Transitioning to clean, accessible energy through Bioregional Autonomous Zones and community energy sovereignty
- **Climate Finance**: Mobilizing and directing capital through the Global Carbon Levy and reparations mechanisms toward frontline communities and ecosystem restoration
- **Climate Justice**: Ensuring equitable burden-sharing and benefit distribution with Indigenous peoples and youth holding decision-making authority
- **Technological Innovation**: Accelerating solutions through Indigenous AI governance protocols and Traditional Knowledge-guided research priorities

Our vision builds on the Treaty's institutional foundations and Indigenous wisdom to create a world that has successfully limited warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels while ensuring energy access for all through community-controlled systems. In this future, nations have transformed their economies to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 through just transitions guided by Indigenous knowledge and youth leadership. Climate-resilient infrastructure, nature-based solutions developed through Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and adaptive capacity protect vulnerable communities from unavoidable impacts. Energy systems are predominantly powered by renewable sources deployed through Bioregional Autonomous Zones, with energy efficiency maximized and universal access achieved through community ownership models.

This governance framework enables a world where climate action strengthens rather than constrains human development, where historical injustices are addressed through reparations and land rematriation, and where natural systems regenerate under Indigenous stewardship. It envisions governance that is democratic, transparent, and accountable to both human and more-than-human communities, with meaningful participation from all stakeholders through the Treaty's enhanced democratic mechanisms, guided by Indigenous wisdom, and coordinated through meta-governance protocols.

### <a id="key-definitions-and-principles"></a>Key Definitions and Principles

To ensure clarity and shared understanding across the integrated governance ecosystem, this framework defines key terms as follows:

- **Net-zero emissions**: A state where greenhouse gas emissions released into the atmosphere are balanced by their removal through Indigenous-led ecosystem restoration and community-controlled carbon sequestration, resulting in no net contribution to atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations. This requires both deep reductions in emissions and enhancement of natural carbon sinks under Traditional Ecological Knowledge guidance.

- **Climate finance**: Financial resources directed toward climate change mitigation, adaptation, and addressing loss and damage, mobilized through the Treaty's Global Carbon Levy and Financial Transaction Tax mechanisms. These include grants, loans, guarantees, and reparations payments from public, private, and innovative sources, with priority distribution to Indigenous communities and frontline populations.

- **Clean energy**: Energy sources that produce minimal or zero greenhouse gas emissions during operation, deployed through Bioregional Autonomous Zones with community ownership and Indigenous guidance. These include solar, wind, hydropower, geothermal, and other renewable sources developed in harmony with local ecosystems and cultural protocols. Fossil fuels, even with carbon capture and storage (CCS), are excluded unless independently verified to deliver net-negative emissions outcomes under Indigenous oversight.

- **Climate justice**: Recognition that climate change affects different populations unequally based on historical responsibility, vulnerability, and capacity, requiring equitable distribution of burdens and benefits in climate action. This includes Indigenous sovereignty over traditional territories, youth decision-making authority on long-term impacts, and reparations for climate damages guided by the Treaty's enforcement mechanisms.

- **Just transition**: A process ensuring the benefits of the transition to a low-carbon, climate-resilient future are shared widely, while supporting those who may lose livelihoods, ensuring energy access for all, and addressing historical inequities. Just transition operates through the Treaty's Sovereignty Bargain mechanisms and is guided by Indigenous economic principles and Traditional Ecological Knowledge about sustainable livelihoods.

- **Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)**: Indigenous and traditional knowledge systems about the relationships between living beings and their environment, accumulated through thousands of years of direct observation and interaction with local ecosystems. TEK serves as primary guidance for climate adaptation strategies, ecosystem management, and sustainable energy development within the framework.

- **Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)**: Geographical areas defined by ecological boundaries rather than political borders, governed through Indigenous sovereignty and Traditional Ecological Knowledge, serving as the primary implementation units for climate and energy transformation while respecting cultural protocols and ecosystem integrity.

These definitions underpin the framework's integrated approach to climate and energy governance, providing common language for diverse stakeholders across the Golden Triangle ecosystem while centering Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and community-controlled implementation pathways.
