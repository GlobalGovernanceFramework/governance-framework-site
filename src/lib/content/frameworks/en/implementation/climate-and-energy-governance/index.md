In an era of mounting climate crisis and escalating ecological collapse, the *Climate & Energy Governance Implementation Framework* emerges as a revolutionary blueprint for Indigenous-led planetary transformation. Operating through the institutional mechanisms of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), guided by the sovereignty and wisdom of the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and coordinated through the [Integrated Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance), this framework represents a fundamental paradigm shift from corporate-controlled climate action to Indigenous-led planetary healing backed by institutional power and democratic authority.

### <a id="framework-position"></a>Framework Position within the Golden Triangle

The Climate & Energy Governance Framework operates as a specialized implementation pathway within the "Golden Triangle" ecosystem of transformative governance mechanisms:

**Institutional Foundation**: The [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home) provides the "hardware"—reformed institutions, enforcement mechanisms, and independent funding through the Global Carbon Levy ($200+ billion annually) and Global Enforcement Mechanism prosecuting climate crimes.

**Wisdom Foundation**: The [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge) provides the "heart and soul"—Traditional Ecological Knowledge as primary guidance, Indigenous territorial sovereignty through Bioregional Autonomous Zones, and Rights of Nature legal frameworks treating ecosystems as legal persons.

**Coordination Architecture**: The [Integrated Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance) provides the "nervous system"—coordination protocols enabling 24-hour crisis response, 7-dimension evaluation systems, and cross-domain integration preventing policy conflicts.

This integration transforms climate governance from technical coordination to comprehensive planetary transformation that is institutionally empowered, Indigenous-led, and systematically coordinated.

### <a id="revolutionary-approach"></a>Revolutionary Approach to Climate Governance

This framework represents a complete departure from existing climate governance approaches:

**From Consultation to Indigenous Sovereignty**: Indigenous peoples transition from "stakeholders to consult" to sovereign decision-makers with territorial authority over climate and energy governance within [Bioregional Autonomous Zones](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components).

**From Voluntary to Enforceable**: Climate action gains enforcement authority through the [Global Enforcement Mechanism](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars), prosecuting ecocide, seizing corporate assets, and protecting Indigenous territorial rights with criminal penalties for violations.

**From Corporate Extraction to Community Control**: Climate finance flows directly to Indigenous communities and frontline populations through the [Global Carbon Levy](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars), while corporate fossil fuel assets are transferred to community ownership.

**From Western Science Dominance to Traditional Knowledge Leadership**: [Traditional Ecological Knowledge](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#key-mechanisms) serves as primary guidance for climate decisions, with Western science providing supplementary rather than dominant authority.

**From Nation-State Boundaries to Bioregional Governance**: Climate implementation occurs through Indigenous-controlled [Bioregional Autonomous Zones](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) that follow ecosystem boundaries and traditional territories rather than colonial borders.

**From Corporate Profit to Rights of Nature**: Climate governance operates within [Rights of Nature](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#core-principles) legal frameworks, treating forests, rivers, wetlands, and other beings as legal persons with Indigenous communities serving as legal guardians.

### Purpose and Transformative Vision

**Purpose**: To accelerate Indigenous-led transformation toward a climate-stable, equitable energy future that limits warming to 1.5°C through Traditional Ecological Knowledge, ensures universal energy access through community ownership, and builds resilience through Traditional Knowledge-based adaptation—all while strengthening Indigenous sovereignty and cultural practices.

**Transformative Vision**: A world where climate action is led by those most affected and most knowledgeable about sustainable ecosystem relationships, where corporate climate criminals face prosecution and asset seizure, where youth hold decision-making authority on long-term climate commitments, where Traditional Ecological Knowledge guides AI systems and technology development, and where Gross Planetary Health replaces GDP as the measure of economic success.

### Key Features

This framework creates unprecedented transformation through:

- **Indigenous Territorial Sovereignty**: [Bioregional Autonomous Zones](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) with Indigenous authority over climate and energy decisions affecting traditional territories
- **Massive Climate Reparations**: $8+ trillion in recognized climate debt with annual reparations flowing to Indigenous communities and frontline populations
- **Corporate Climate Accountability**: [Global Enforcement Mechanism](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) prosecuting climate crimes with CEO prison sentences and asset transfer to community ownership
- **Democratic Climate Authority**: [Global Citizens' Initiative](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) enabling binding referendums on climate policies transcending national boundaries
- **Youth Future-Impact Authority**: Youth councils with veto power over climate policies causing harm across seven generations
- **Traditional Knowledge AI Governance**: AI systems trained on Traditional Ecological Knowledge with Indigenous oversight and community shutdown authority
- **Community Energy Sovereignty**: 80% community-owned renewable energy with democratic control replacing corporate energy extraction
- **Rights of Nature Legal Protection**: Ecosystems as legal persons with Indigenous guardianship and ecocide prosecution for violations
- **Gross Planetary Health Economics**: Traditional wealth concepts and ecosystem health indicators replacing GDP as economic success measures
- **Emergency Response with Indigenous Authority**: [24-hour crisis protocols](/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components) maintaining Indigenous sovereignty during climate emergencies

- **Transform**: Adapt approaches to local contexts while maintaining alignment with Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Knowledge protection, and community control principles.

**Indigenous Data Sovereignty Commitment**: All interactions respect Indigenous intellectual property rights, community data protocols, and Free, Prior, and Informed Consent principles. Communities maintain complete control over their information and participation levels.

**Revolution, Not Reform**: This framework prioritizes fundamental transformation over incremental change, Indigenous leadership over consultation, and community control over corporate accommodation.

**Call to Revolutionary Action**: Climate governance requires unprecedented transformation from corporate extraction to Indigenous-led planetary healing. The institutional mechanisms exist through the Treaty. The wisdom exists through Traditional Ecological Knowledge. The coordination exists through Meta-Governance. What remains is building the political will to choose Indigenous sovereignty over corporate power, Traditional Knowledge over extractive science, and community ownership over profit maximization.

Join Indigenous communities, youth climate leaders, and frontline populations worldwide in building the climate governance system our planet urgently needs—one that serves ecosystems and communities rather than corporate shareholders, one guided by Traditional Ecological Knowledge rather than corporate greenwashing, and one accountable to future generations rather than quarterly profits.

**The transformation begins with Indigenous sovereignty. The future is Traditional Knowledge-guided. The time is now.**
