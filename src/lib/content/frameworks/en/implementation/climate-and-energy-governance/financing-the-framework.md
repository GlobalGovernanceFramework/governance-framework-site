# Financing the Framework

**In this section:**

- [Global Carbon Levy and Climate Reparations](#global-carbon-levy-climate-reparations)
- [Indigenous-Controlled Resource Flows](#indigenous-controlled-resource-flows)
- [Community Economic Sovereignty](#community-economic-sovereignty)

The Climate & Energy Governance Framework requires unprecedented financial resources mobilized through fundamentally transformed economic relationships that center Indigenous sovereignty, community control, and climate reparations. Operating through the institutional mechanisms of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), guided by Indigenous economic principles from the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and coordinated through the [Integrated Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance), this financing approach redistributes wealth from extractive corporations and high-emission nations to Indigenous communities and frontline populations leading planetary restoration.

### From Corporate Extraction to Community Control

The financing framework transforms economic relationships from corporate profit extraction to community-controlled resource flows:

**Indigenous Economic Sovereignty**: Financing systems operate through Indigenous economic principles including reciprocity, seven-generation thinking, and [Gross Planetary Health (GPH)](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#key-mechanisms) rather than imposed Western economic models prioritizing profit maximization.

**Community Ownership Priority**: All climate and energy investments prioritize community ownership and control, ensuring resources serve local needs and cultural values rather than distant corporate shareholders.

**Reparations-Based Resource Flow**: Climate financing recognizes historical responsibility for climate damages, with high-emission nations and fossil fuel corporations providing reparations to Indigenous communities and frontline populations rather than extractive loans.

**Rights of Nature Economic Integration**: Economic systems recognize [Rights of Nature](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#core-principles), with ecosystem health and regeneration serving as foundational economic indicators rather than externalized costs.

### Treaty-Enabled Financing Authority

**Global Carbon Levy Implementation** (enabled by [Treaty Pillar 4](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars)): Carbon taxation with escalating rates making fossil fuels economically unviable while generating $200+ billion annually for Indigenous-led restoration and community adaptation.

**Financial Transaction Tax for Climate Justice**: 0.1% tax on high-frequency financial transactions generating $150+ billion annually for climate reparations and Indigenous technology sovereignty.

**Fossil Fuel Subsidy Elimination**: $5.9 trillion in annual fossil fuel subsidies redirected to community-controlled renewable energy and Indigenous land restoration.

**Corporate Asset Transfer Authority**: [Global Enforcement Mechanism](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) authority to seize corporate assets from climate criminals and transfer ownership to affected communities and ecosystems.

### Meta-Governance Financial Coordination

**Cross-Domain Resource Integration**: Climate finance coordinated with health, food, economic, and security governance through the [Climate & Energy Meta-Council](/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components) to prevent contradictory resource allocation and ensure holistic community support.

**Crisis Response Finance**: [24-hour emergency protocols](/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components) enable immediate resource mobilization during climate disasters while maintaining community control over emergency resource allocation.

**Evaluation-Based Resource Adjustment**: [7-Dimension Assessment](/frameworks/meta-governance#evaluation) guides resource allocation, ensuring finance serves community needs, cultural integrity, and ecosystem health rather than bureaucratic or corporate interests.
