# Governance Structure

**In this section:**
- [Integrated Governance Architecture](#integrated-governance-architecture)
- [Climate & Energy Meta-Council](#climate-energy-meta-council)
- [Earth Council Climate Stewardship Authority](#earth-council-climate-stewardship-authority)
- [Bioregional Climate Governance](#bioregional-climate-governance)
- [Treaty-Enabled Implementation Bodies](#treaty-enabled-implementation-bodies)
- [Democratic Participation and Accountability](#democratic-participation-and-accountability)
- [Crisis Response and Emergency Protocols](#crisis-response-and-emergency-protocols)

The Climate & Energy Governance Framework operates through a sophisticated multi-level architecture that integrates the institutional mechanisms of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), Indigenous sovereignty through the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and coordination protocols from the [Integrated Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance). This structure ensures climate governance is simultaneously effective, just, and resilient across scales from local bioregions to planetary coordination.

- Integrates Traditional Ecological Knowledge into global climate science
- Exercises moral authority through Indigenous consensus processes

### Global Level: Climate & Energy Meta-Council
**Coordination Source**: [Integrated Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components)
- Specialized coordination body reporting to Earth Council
- Bridges climate governance with other domain frameworks
- Implements 24-hour crisis response protocols
- Manages cross-domain climate integration

### Regional Level: Bioregional Climate Hubs
**Implementation Source**: [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components)
- Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs) serve as primary implementation units

- **Scientific and Technical Experts** (20%): Climate scientists, energy systems specialists, and TEK-trained researchers
- **Community Representatives** (15%): Frontline communities, labor unions, and local climate leaders

**Leadership Model**: 
- **Rotating Indigenous Co-Chairs**: Traditional leaders from different bioregions serve 3-year terms
- **Youth Climate Authority**: Youth council with veto power over decisions affecting future generations
- **TEK Integration Protocols**: All technical decisions require Traditional Ecological Knowledge validation

### Core Functions

**Coordination Across Domains**:
