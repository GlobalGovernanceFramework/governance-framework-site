## Core Pillars

**In this section:**
- [Integrated Pillar Framework](#integrated-pillar-framework)
- [Climate Mitigation through Indigenous Restoration](#climate-mitigation)
- [Climate Adaptation with Traditional Knowledge](#climate-adaptation)
- [Community-Controlled Energy Transition](#energy-transition)
- [Innovation & Technology under Indigenous Governance](#innovation--technology)

The Climate & Energy Governance Framework operates through four interconnected pillars that address the full spectrum of climate and energy challenges within the Golden Triangle ecosystem. These pillars are designed to work synergistically, with each drawing on the institutional mechanisms of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), the wisdom and sovereignty of the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and the coordination protocols of the [Integrated Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance).

## <a id="integrated-pillar-framework"></a>Integrated Pillar Framework

### Foundational Integration Principles

**Indigenous Knowledge Centrality**: All four pillars operate with [Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#key-mechanisms) as the primary guidance system, treating Indigenous knowledge as foundational rather than supplementary to climate action.

**Bioregional Implementation**: Climate and energy solutions are implemented through [Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components), respecting ecosystem boundaries and Indigenous territorial sovereignty.

**Treaty-Enabled Authority**: Each pillar operates through the institutional mechanisms established by the Treaty, including the [Global Carbon Levy](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) for funding, the [Global Enforcement Mechanism](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) for accountability, and enhanced democratic participation through the [Global Citizens' Initiative](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars).

**Meta-Governance Coordination**: The pillars are coordinated through the [Climate & Energy Meta-Council](/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components) to prevent conflicts with other governance domains and ensure crisis response capability.

### Cross-Pillar Synergies

**Rights of Nature Legal Framework**: All pillars operate within the [Rights of Nature](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#core-principles) legal framework, treating ecosystems as legal persons with rights to exist, regenerate, and maintain ecological integrity.

**Seventh-Generation Accountability**: Every pillar includes assessment protocols for impacts across seven generations, guided by Indigenous wisdom and overseen by youth councils with veto authority on long-term decisions.

**Community Economic Control**: All pillars prioritize community ownership and control over climate and energy infrastructure, supporting Indigenous economic sovereignty and cooperative models rather than corporate extraction.

**Crisis Integration**: Each pillar includes [24-hour emergency response protocols](/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components) that can be activated during climate emergencies while maintaining Indigenous authority and democratic accountability.

## <a id="climate-mitigation"></a>A. Climate Mitigation through Indigenous Restoration

Climate mitigation focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks through Indigenous-led ecosystem restoration and community-controlled renewable energy deployment. This pillar recognizes that Indigenous territories contain 80% of the world's biodiversity and that Traditional Ecological Knowledge provides the most effective approaches to ecosystem restoration and carbon sequestration.
