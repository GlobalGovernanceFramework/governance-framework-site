## Core Pillars

**In this section:**
- [Climate Mitigation](#climate-mitigation)
- [Climate Adaptation](#climate-adaptation)
- [Energy Transition](#energy-transition)
- [Innovation & Technology](#innovation--technology)

The Climate & Energy Governance Framework is structured around four interconnected pillars that together address the full spectrum of climate and energy challenges. These pillars—Climate Mitigation, Climate Adaptation, Energy Transition, and Innovation & Technology—form the substantive foundation upon which governance activities are organized. While presented separately, these pillars are deeply interrelated and require integrated implementation approaches.

### <a id="climate-mitigation"></a>A. Climate Mitigation

Climate mitigation focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions and enhancing carbon sinks to prevent dangerous levels of climate change. This pillar establishes clear targets and strategies for rapid decarbonization across all sectors.

#### Targets and Timeframes

Building on the scientific consensus and the Paris Agreement's temperature goals, this framework establishes:

- **Global Net-Zero Target**: Achievement of net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050, with interim milestones of 50% reduction from 2020 levels by 2035 and 75% by 2040.

- **Sectoral Pathways**: Differentiated decarbonization timelines for key sectors based on technical and economic feasibility:
  - Power generation: Net-zero by 2040
  - Transportation: Net-zero by 2045
  - Buildings: Net-zero by 2045
  - Industry: Net-zero by 2050
  - Agriculture and land use: Net-zero by 2050

- **Equity-Based National Targets**: Country-specific emissions reduction pathways that reflect common but differentiated responsibilities, with developed nations achieving steeper, earlier reductions.

- **Carbon Budget Allocation**: Transparent methodologies for allocating remaining carbon budgets consistent with 1.5°C pathways, incorporating both historical responsibility and development needs.

#### Implementation Strategies

To achieve these ambitious targets, the framework promotes a comprehensive set of mitigation strategies:

- **Carbon Pricing**: Implementation of effective carbon pricing through taxes, trading systems, or hybrid approaches, with price floors that rise predictably over time and provisions to prevent regressive impacts on vulnerable populations.

- **Regulatory Approaches**: Performance standards, technology mandates, and phase-out schedules for high-emission activities, coordinated across jurisdictions to prevent carbon leakage.

- **Nature-Based Solutions (NbS)**: Large-scale implementation of ecosystem protection, restoration, and sustainable management to enhance carbon sequestration while delivering biodiversity and community benefits, aligned with the Kunming-Montreal Global Biodiversity Framework.

- **Industrial Transformation**: Sector-specific decarbonization roadmaps for emissions-intensive industries (e.g., steel, cement, chemicals), incorporating circular economy principles, material efficiency, and clean production technologies.

- **Consumption-Based Accounting**: Complementing territorial emissions accounting with tracking of embedded emissions in traded goods to address offshore emissions and promote sustainable consumption.

- **Short-Lived Climate Pollutant Reduction**: Targeted strategies for rapidly reducing methane, black carbon, and hydrofluorocarbons to deliver immediate climate benefits while CO₂ reductions scale up.

#### Integrating with Other Pillars

Climate mitigation is connected to other pillars through:

- **Co-Benefits Maximization**: Prioritizing mitigation actions that simultaneously advance adaptation goals, such as ecosystem-based approaches that both sequester carbon and build resilience.

- **Energy-Mitigation Nexus**: Closely coordinating emissions reduction strategies with clean energy deployment to ensure the energy transition delivers intended climate benefits.

- **Innovation for Mitigation**: Targeting technology development toward high-impact, hard-to-abate sectors where current solutions are insufficient.

- **Just Transition Integration**: Ensuring mitigation policies incorporate social protection, economic diversification, and community engagement to address potential adverse impacts on workers and communities.

### <a id="climate-adaptation"></a>B. Climate Adaptation

As climate impacts intensify even under successful mitigation scenarios, adaptation to unavoidable changes is essential. This pillar focuses on building resilience and reducing vulnerability to climate impacts.

#### Key Priorities

The framework establishes the following adaptation priorities:

- **Vulnerability Reduction**: Targeted interventions to reduce exposure and sensitivity to climate impacts, particularly for highly vulnerable populations and ecosystems.

- **Adaptive Capacity Building**: Strengthening the ability of communities, institutions, and ecosystems to anticipate, respond to, and recover from climate disruptions.

- **Systemic Resilience**: Moving beyond project-based adaptation to transform systems (e.g., food, water, infrastructure, health) to function under changing climate conditions.

- **Transformational Adaptation**: Where incremental approaches are insufficient, supporting more fundamental changes in location, livelihoods, or practices to address severe climate risks.

- **Limits to Adaptation**: Recognizing and planning for situations where adaptation may not be feasible, particularly in relation to loss and damage.

#### Implementation Approaches

To advance these priorities, the framework promotes:

- **National Adaptation Planning**: Support for comprehensive, participatory national adaptation plans aligned with global temperature scenarios and integrated with development strategies.

- **Mainstreaming Adaptation**: Integration of climate risk considerations into all relevant policy domains, including infrastructure, agriculture, water management, health, and urban planning.

- **Ecosystem-Based Adaptation**: Implementation of nature-based solutions that harness ecosystem services to buffer climate impacts while delivering multiple co-benefits, aligned with biodiversity conservation goals under the Kunming-Montreal Framework.

### <a id="energy-transition"></a>C. Energy Transition

The energy transition pillar focuses on transforming global energy systems from fossil fuel dependence to clean, accessible, and efficient alternatives, addressing both climate mitigation and sustainable development.

#### Transformation Goals

The framework establishes the following energy transition goals:

- **Clean Energy Deployment**: Achieving 90-100% clean energy in global electricity systems by 2050, with interim targets of 60% by 2035 and 80% by 2040, consistent with IPCC 1.5°C pathways.
