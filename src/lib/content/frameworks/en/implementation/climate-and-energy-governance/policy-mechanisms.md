## Policy Mechanisms

**In this section:**
- [Integrated Policy Framework](#integrated-policy-framework)
- [Treaty-Enabled Legal and Enforcement Mechanisms](#treaty-enabled-legal-enforcement)
- [Indigenous-Led Economic Transformation Tools](#indigenous-led-economic-tools)
- [Traditional Knowledge Integration and Protection](#traditional-knowledge-integration)
- [Community Governance and Democratic Participation](#community-governance-democratic-participation)
- [Crisis Response and Emergency Protocols](#crisis-response-emergency-protocols)
- [Meta-Governance Coordination Mechanisms](#meta-governance-coordination-mechanisms)

The Climate & Energy Governance Framework requires robust, coordinated policy mechanisms that operate through the institutional authority of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), are guided by the wisdom and sovereignty of the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and utilize the coordination protocols of the [Integrated Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance). These mechanisms ensure accountability, coordination, and effective implementation while centering Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and community control.

## <a id="integrated-policy-framework"></a>Integrated Policy Framework

### Foundation in Indigenous Sovereignty and Treaty Authority

The policy mechanisms operate through a transformed understanding of authority and legitimacy:

**Indigenous Territorial Sovereignty**: Policy implementation within [Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) follows Indigenous governance protocols, with Traditional Ecological Knowledge serving as primary guidance for climate and energy policies.

**Treaty-Enabled Enforcement**: Policies gain enforcement authority through the [Global Enforcement Mechanism](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars), enabling prosecution of climate crimes and protection of Indigenous territorial rights.

**Rights of Nature Legal Foundation**: All policy mechanisms operate within the [Rights of Nature](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#core-principles) legal framework, treating ecosystems as legal persons with Indigenous communities serving as legal guardians.

**Meta-Governance Integration**: Policy coordination occurs through the [Climate & Energy Meta-Council](/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components), preventing conflicts with other governance domains while enabling rapid crisis response.

### Policy Coherence Across the Golden Triangle

**Indigenous Knowledge Validation**: All climate and energy policies require validation through Traditional Ecological Knowledge systems, ensuring policies support rather than undermine Indigenous relationships with ecosystems.

**Youth Future-Impact Assessment**: Major policies undergo assessment by youth councils with veto authority over decisions causing harm across seven generations.

**Community Economic Sovereignty**: Policy mechanisms prioritize community ownership and control over climate and energy infrastructure, preventing corporate extraction while supporting Indigenous economic systems.

**Democratic Accountability**: Enhanced participation through the [Global Citizens' Initiative](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars) enables binding referendums on major climate policies, ensuring democratic legitimacy transcends national boundaries.
