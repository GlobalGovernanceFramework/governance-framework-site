  - Community-driven crowdfunding campaigns prioritize marginalized regions, ensuring 50% of funds support indigenous and low-resource areas.

### Post-Implementation Sustainability Plans (2035–2045)
- **Objective**: Maintain financial stability, system resilience, and equitable access to framework components (e.g., AUBI, commons governance, trade zones) for a 10-year period post-implementation.
- **Total Estimated Cost**: $300M (2035–2045) for maintenance, updates, and stakeholder engagement.
- **Sustainability Strategies**:
  1. **Self-Sustaining Revenue Streams**:
     - **Action**: Generate revenue from framework components, such as 5% transaction fees on community currencies and trade zones, and licensing fees for proprietary tools (e.g., Nested Economic Health Index APIs).
     - **Tactic**: Allocate 50% of revenue to maintenance (e.g., blockchain nodes, platform updates) and 50% to reinvestment in marginalized communities (e.g., AUBI enhancements, tech transfer).
     - **Example**: Bristol Pound sustained operations through 2% transaction fees, funding platform upgrades and community training.
     - **Metric**: $100M annual revenue from transaction and licensing fees by 2040, tracked via financial audits.
  2. **Endowment Fund**:
     - **Action**: Establish a $150M endowment by 2035, funded by surplus implementation funds, private sector contributions, and multilateral grants, to support ongoing operations.
     - **Tactic**: Invest endowment in ESG-compliant assets (e.g., green bonds), targeting 4% annual returns to fund $6M/year for maintenance and training.
     - **Example**: The Grameen Foundation’s endowment model sustained microfinance programs, informing this approach.
     - **Metric**: $150M endowment fully funded by 2035, with 90% investment compliance to ESG standards, verified via audits.
  3. **Decentralized Funding Networks**:
     - **Action**: Create regional funding cooperatives by 2037, pooling resources from local governments, cooperatives, and communities to fund regional maintenance (e.g., trade zone audits, GIS updates).
     - **Tactic**: Use blockchain-based smart contracts to manage contributions, ensuring 80% transparency and 50% representation of women, non-binary, and indigenous leaders in cooperative governance.
     - **Example**: Great Lakes Commons used regional funding pools to maintain water governance, reducing reliance on external grants.
     - **Metric**: 20 regional funding cooperatives operational by 2040, funding 70% of regional maintenance costs, tracked via cooperative reports.
  4. **Stakeholder Engagement and Crowdfunding**:
     - **Action**: Sustain #NestedEconomies campaigns post-2035, targeting 500K annual engagements to maintain public support and raise $20M via crowdfunding by 2045.
     - **Tactic**: Leverage youth and indigenous-led campaigns with multilingual, low-tech content (e.g., radio, community boards) to drive donations, prioritizing low-resource areas.
     - **Example**: AUBI pilots sustained community support through grassroots crowdfunding, raising $5M post-pilot.
     - **Metric**: $20M raised via crowdfunding by 2045, with 80% of funds supporting marginalized communities, tracked via platform analytics.
  5. **Global Resilience Fund Contributions**:
     - **Action**: Allocate 10% of the $100B global crisis fund (established in 2035) to sustainability, providing $10B over 10 years for system maintenance and crisis response.
     - **Tactic**: Use UN-mediated agreements to ensure equitable distribution, with 50% of funds supporting low-resource regions and indigenous-led initiatives.
     - **Example**: The Green Climate Fund’s model of sustained contributions informs this approach, ensuring long-term resilience.
     - **Metric**: $10B allocated from crisis fund by 2045, with 90% distribution efficiency, tracked via UN audits.
- **Cost Breakdown (2035–2045)**:
  - $100M: System maintenance (blockchain nodes, platform updates, GIS tools).
  - $80M: Training and capacity building (facilitators, community workshops).
  - $70M: Accessibility enhancements (multilingual tools, offline systems, disability inclusion).
  - $50M: Stakeholder engagement and advocacy (campaigns, regional cooperatives).
- **Mechanisms**:
  - Biennial sustainability audits ensure 90% funding efficiency, using the **Sample Audit Report Template**.
  - Adaptive funding models evolve based on feedback from the **Community Survey Toolkit**, ensuring 80% stakeholder input.
  - Decentralized governance of funding cooperatives empowers local control, aligned with sovereignty principles.

## <a id="accessibility"></a>Accessibility
The timeline prioritizes inclusivity for diverse populations:
- **Low-Tech Options**: Radio broadcasts and paper guides disseminate milestone updates, funding opportunities, and sustainability plans in low-connectivity areas.
- **Disability Inclusion**: Digital platforms (e.g., Health Index Dashboard) support screen readers, voice navigation, and tactile interfaces; offline tools include Braille and oral formats.
- **Multilingual Materials**: Tools, campaigns, and funding guides in 10 languages, with visual and audio formats.
- **Gender and Indigenous Focus**: 50% women/non-binary and indigenous representation in leadership and funding cooperatives, with tailored workshops.

## <a id="case-study"></a>Case Study
- **Bristol Pound (UK)**: The Bristol Pound achieved 70% local transaction share by 2020 through a phased rollout (2012–2020), with pilots scaling city-wide. Its sustainability was supported by 2% transaction fees, which funded platform upgrades and training, informing the framework’s post-implementation plans. This success is reflected in the Implementation Timeline Guide and Community Survey Toolkit.

## <a id="integration-with-framework"></a>Integration with Framework
The Implementation Timeline advances the framework’s principles:
- **Sovereignty**: Phased pilots and decentralized funding cooperatives empower local control.
- **Interoperability**: Tools sync progress data across scales via blockchain APIs, with sustainability plans ensuring long-term compatibility.
- **Justice**: Inclusive leadership and funding allocation prioritize marginalized groups.
- **Adaptability**: Feedback-driven refinements and adaptive funding models align with evolving needs, tracked via the Nested Economic Health Index.

Tools are accessible via the **Economic Integration Seed Kit**, and progress is visualized in the **Nested Systems Diagram** (green local circles, blue regional webs, red global sphere). The timeline links to other framework components through interdependencies, such as digital access for AUBI and climate compliance for trade zones.

## <a id="call-to-action"></a>Call to Action
Stakeholders are invited to:
1. Launch pilots using the Implementation Timeline Guide.
2. Track progress with the Nested Economic Health Index Dashboard.
3. Engage communities via the Economic Advocacy Campaign Toolkit and #NestedEconomies.
