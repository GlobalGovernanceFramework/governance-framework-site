Economic Meta-Governance represents the coordination architecture that ensures regenerative economic transformation serves Indigenous sovereignty, ecological restoration, and planetary healing rather than perpetuating extractive capitalism under new names. This framework details how the **Economic Meta-Council** coordinates between financial institutions, labor organizations, environmental stewards, and trade bodies to implement the **Economic Sufficiency & Circulation principle** while maintaining Traditional Knowledge authority and Indigenous community control over economic decisions affecting traditional territories. Grounded in the principles of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), [Indigenous Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and [Meta-Governance coordination](/frameworks/meta-governance), these mechanisms prioritize Indigenous sovereignty, ecological integrity, and seven-generation accountability over market efficiency and corporate profit maximization.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

Economic Meta-Governance serves as the coordination system ensuring that diverse economic actors align with regenerative principles and Indigenous sovereignty rather than competing for extraction and accumulation. This framework transforms economic relationships from competition and exploitation to cooperation and reciprocity through comprehensive coordination protocols that center Traditional Knowledge and planetary health.

**Positioning within Golden Triangle**: This economic meta-governance framework operationalizes the [Meta-Governance Economic Coordination](/frameworks/meta-governance#economic-coordination), integrates the [Treaty's Global Economic Stability](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#economic-stability) mechanisms, and ensures all economic coordination serves the [Indigenous Governance Framework's sovereignty and Traditional Knowledge priorities](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#economic-sovereignty) while maintaining Indigenous authority over decisions affecting traditional territories.

**Core Transformation**: Economic meta-governance shifts from:
- **From**: Market competition and regulatory capture by powerful economic interests
- **To**: Cooperative coordination and Indigenous sovereignty recognition in economic governance
- **From**: Corporate self-regulation and voluntary compliance with minimal oversight
- **To**: Comprehensive accountability frameworks with Traditional Knowledge authority and community enforcement
- **From**: Economic growth prioritization and profit maximization regardless of ecological and social costs
- **To**: Economic sufficiency and circulation principles guided by seven-generation thinking and planetary boundaries
- **From**: Technocratic economic management by experts isolated from affected communities
- **To**: Democratic economic governance with Indigenous communities holding authority over decisions affecting traditional territories

**Vision**: Establish economic meta-governance systems where Indigenous communities exercise sovereignty over economic decisions affecting traditional territories, Traditional Knowledge guides all economic coordination, and the Economic Meta-Council ensures that financial institutions, corporations, labor organizations, and environmental stewards serve regenerative abundance rather than extractive accumulation.

**2050 Commitment**: 100% of major economic decisions affecting Indigenous territories require Indigenous consent and Traditional Knowledge guidance, 90% of economic institutions operate under regenerative principles guided by the Economic Meta-Council, and 80% of global economic activity serves ecological restoration and cultural revitalization rather than extraction and accumulation.

## <a id="case-study"></a>Case Study

**Mondragon Cooperative Corporation Economic Coordination (Basque Country, Spain)**: The Mondragon Cooperative system demonstrates successful coordination between diverse economic institutions including worker cooperatives, credit unions, insurance companies, and educational institutions operating under shared principles of worker ownership, democratic governance, and community benefit. Beginning in 1956, Mondragon developed comprehensive coordination mechanisms including the Caja Laboral Popular (credit union) providing financial services, the Congress coordinating policy across cooperatives, and sectoral divisions enabling specialized coordination while maintaining overall coherence. The system achieved coordination between 96 cooperatives employing 81,000 worker-owners with shared governance principles, financial solidarity mechanisms, and educational development supporting cooperative expansion while maintaining democratic control and community benefit rather than external shareholder profit. This case informs economic meta-governance approaches, demonstrating the effectiveness of principled coordination between diverse economic institutions while maintaining democratic control and shared values, adapted in the Economic Meta-Council Formation Guide and Cross-Sector Coordination Protocols to center Indigenous sovereignty and Traditional Knowledge rather than European cooperative traditions.
