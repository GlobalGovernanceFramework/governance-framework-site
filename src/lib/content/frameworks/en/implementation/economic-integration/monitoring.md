Monitoring and Evaluation (M&E) is critical to the Nested Sovereignty Framework, ensuring transparency, accountability, and continuous improvement in achieving equitable and sustainable economic integration. This section details mechanisms for tracking progress, assessing outcomes, and refining policies across local, regional, and global levels using quantitative key performance indicators (KPIs), qualitative surveys, dashboards, and audits. Co-designed with indigenous communities, women, non-binary individuals, and marginalized groups, M&E processes uphold sovereignty, interoperability, justice, and adaptability, prioritizing accessibility and inclusivity for diverse stakeholders.

## <a id="mechanisms"></a>Mechanisms
M&E mechanisms operate across three levels to provide comprehensive oversight and feedback:
- **Local M&E**:
  - **Local KPIs**: Track metrics like 70% local transaction share and 80% participatory budgeting engagement, collected via transaction logs and platform data.
  - **Community Surveys**: Qualitative feedback from residents assesses satisfaction and equity (target: 80% approval), conducted via digital and offline methods.
  - **Local Audits**: Biannual audits of currencies and cooperatives ensure transparency, guided by the Sample Audit Report Template.
- **Regional M&E**:
  - **Regional KPIs**: Monitor 90% trade compliance and 30% transaction cost reduction, tracked through blockchain ledgers and trade zone reports.
  - **Cross-Community Feedback**: Regional platforms aggregate stakeholder input to evaluate trade zones and watershed protocols, ensuring adaptability.
  - **Regional Audits**: Biannual reviews assess commons governance and redistribution, with findings shared via dashboards.
- **Global M&E**:
  - **Global KPIs**: Evaluate 80% commons treaty adoption and 90% AUBI coverage, monitored via UN reports and financial ledgers.
  - **Global Surveys**: Qualitative data from diverse regions assess framework impact, targeting 80% stakeholder approval.
  - **Global Audits**: Biennial audits of commons treaties and AUBI distribution ensure accountability, with results informing policy updates.

Global M&E systems produce standardized reporting compatible with WTO/IMF/World Bank metrics while extending beyond them to include sovereignty and justice indicators, reducing reporting burdens for participating regions by 40%.

## <a id="tools"></a>Tools
The Economic Integration Seed Kit provides resources for M&E:
- **Nested Economic Health Index Dashboard**: Visualizes KPIs (gauges for sovereignty, equity, interoperability; bar charts for trends), accessible at globalgovernanceframework.org.
- **Sample Audit Report Template**: Guides local, regional, and global audits, with standardized metrics and inclusivity clauses.
- **Community Survey Toolkit**: Provides templates for digital and offline surveys, with multilingual and accessible formats.
- **Resource Mapping Tool**: A GIS-based tool tracks economic and environmental metrics, accessible offline for low-tech regions.
- **Real-Time Collaboration Platform**: A GitHub-based hub (globalgovernanceframework.org/collab) enables stakeholders to co-develop M&E tools through live editing and forums.

## <a id="metrics"></a>Metrics
M&E is driven by a balanced mix of quantitative and qualitative indicators:
- **Quantitative KPIs**:
  - **Sovereignty**: 70% local transaction share by 2035 (local).
  - **Equity**: 80% commons and AUBI access by 2035 (all levels).
  - **Interoperability**: 90% system compatibility by 2035 (regional/global).
  - **Economic Impact**: 50% tax avoidance reduction by 2035 (global).
- **Qualitative Metrics**:
  - **Stakeholder Approval**: 80% approval rating via surveys by 2030.
  - **Community Feedback**: 80% of feedback integrated into policy updates by 2035.
- **Nested Economic Health Index**: A composite metric (40% transactions, 30% access, 30% interoperability) aggregates data, visualized on the dashboard.

   - **Implementation Tool**: The **Power-Aware Learning System** facilitates knowledge transfer

By incorporating these power-aware monitoring and evaluation components, the framework builds capacity to identify, track, and respond to power dynamics affecting implementation. Rather than treating implementation as a purely technical process, this approach recognizes that power relationships fundamentally shape outcomes and must be explicitly addressed for success.
