The Gross Planetary Health (GPH) Implementation framework represents the fundamental transformation from colonial economic measurement to Indigenous-led planetary wellness assessment, replacing GDP as the primary indicator of societal success with Traditional Knowledge-guided metrics that honor the health of relationships between humans, ecosystems, and future generations. This framework details comprehensive protocols for implementing GPH indicators that center ecological restoration, cultural vitality, and seven-generation accountability as the foundation for regenerative economic systems. Grounded in the principles of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), [Indigenous Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and [Meta-Governance coordination](/frameworks/meta-governance), these mechanisms prioritize Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and planetary healing over extractive metrics that disconnect human prosperity from ecological and cultural health.

## <a id="overview"></a>Overview

GPH Implementation serves as the central measurement transformation ensuring that economic and political systems are evaluated based on their contribution to planetary health, Indigenous sovereignty, and seven-generation sustainability rather than accumulation, extraction, and short-term growth that destroys the Earth and Indigenous cultures.

**Positioning within Golden Triangle**: This GPH framework operationalizes the [Indigenous Governance Framework's Gross Planetary Health Index](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#gph-index), integrates with the [Treaty's Global Monitoring Systems](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#global-monitoring) for international accountability, and coordinates through the [Meta-Governance evaluation framework](/frameworks/meta-governance#evaluation-coordination) while maintaining Indigenous authority over indicator development and cultural protocol integration.

**Core Transformation**: GPH implementation shifts from:
- **From**: Gross Domestic Product (GDP) measuring market transactions and accumulation
- **To**: Gross Planetary Health measuring ecological restoration and cultural vitality
- **From**: Individual wealth indicators and competitive national rankings
- **To**: Collective well-being assessment and bioregional cooperation measures
- **From**: Quarterly profit cycles and annual growth targets
- **To**: Seven-generation impact evaluation and ceremonial governance rhythms
- **From**: Colonial scientific reductionism and external expert validation
- **To**: Traditional Knowledge holistic assessment and Indigenous community authority

**Vision**: Establish GPH as the globally recognized standard for measuring societal success, where Traditional Knowledge holders guide all indicator development, ecosystems and Indigenous cultures are recognized as essential planetary health infrastructure, and seven-generation thinking ensures all decisions serve ecological and cultural flourishing across time scales.

**2050 Commitment**: 100% of governments and institutions adopt GPH as primary success metric, 90% of critical ecosystems show measurable health improvement under Traditional Knowledge stewardship, and 80% of Indigenous cultures demonstrate strengthened vitality through GPH-guided policy and resource allocation.

## <a id="gph-index-framework"></a>GPH Index Framework

The GPH Index provides comprehensive planetary health assessment through Traditional Knowledge-guided indicators that recognize the inseparable connections between ecological health, cultural vitality, and community well-being within Indigenous worldviews.

### Core GPH Components (Weighted Framework)

## <a id="case-study"></a>Case Study

**Bhutan's Gross National Happiness (GNH) Index**: Bhutan's adoption of Gross National Happiness over GDP demonstrates successful alternative measurement implementation, incorporating spiritual values, environmental conservation, cultural preservation, and good governance as primary indicators of national success. Beginning in the 1970s, Bhutan developed comprehensive GNH assessment including psychological well-being, health, education, cultural diversity, time use, good governance, community vitality, ecological diversity, and living standards, with regular citizen surveys and policy guidance based on happiness rather than economic growth. The GNH framework influenced constitutional requirements for environmental protection, cultural preservation mandates, and governance decisions prioritizing citizen well-being over market indicators, demonstrating how alternative metrics can guide comprehensive policy transformation. This case informs GPH implementation approaches, emphasizing the effectiveness of holistic well-being measurement, cultural value integration, and alternative development guidance, reflected in the GPH Comprehensive Calculator and Community-Controlled Assessment Protocols that adapt GNH lessons while centering Indigenous sovereignty and Traditional Knowledge authority.
