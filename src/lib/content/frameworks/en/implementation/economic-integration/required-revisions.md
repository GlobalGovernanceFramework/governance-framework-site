# Economic Integration Framework: Required Revisions for Golden Triangle Alignment

## Overview of Required Changes

The Economic Integration framework requires fundamental transformation from a community currency-focused model to a comprehensive regenerative economy blueprint that centers Indigenous sovereignty and aligns with the Golden Triangle frameworks.

## 1. Introduction/Preamble Revision (index.md)

### Current State
- Focuses on "economic integration across local, regional, and global scales"
- Emphasizes community currencies, cooperatives, AUBI
- Limited mention of Indigenous knowledge

### Required Transformation
**New framing**: "Blueprint for shifting the global economy from an extractive to a regenerative model, based on the principles of the Golden Triangle"

**Key additions needed**:
- **Explicit Golden Triangle positioning**: Acknowledge this framework as economic implementation of Treaty, Indigenous, and Meta-governance principles
- **Indigenous economic sovereignty**: Center Traditional Ecological Knowledge as foundation for all economic planning
- **Regenerative economy vision**: Replace growth-focused metrics with planetary health indicators
- **Reparations framework**: Position ecological and colonial reparations as core economic policy

## 2. Treaty for Our Only Home Integration

### Global Taxation Mechanisms
**Current gap**: Framework lacks connection to Treaty's funding mechanisms
**Required integration**:
- Make Financial Transaction Tax (FTT) the primary funding source for global public goods
- Connect local currencies to global taxation system
- Implement Carbon Tax mechanisms with revenue sharing

### Global Systemic Stability
**Current gap**: No connection to Treaty's stability framework
**Required integration**:
- Link economic policies to planetary boundary maintenance
- Integrate crisis response mechanisms from Treaty
- Connect AUBI to Treaty's global commons funding

### Specific sections needing revision:
- **global-implementation.md**: Add entire section on "Treaty Integration: Global Taxation and Systemic Stability"
- **funding-roadmap.md**: Replace current funding with Treaty taxation mechanisms
- **cross-domain.md**: Add Treaty institutional coordination

## 3. Indigenous Governance Framework Integration

### Gross Planetary Health (GPH) Index
**Current**: Uses "Nested Economic Health Index" focusing on transactions and access
**Required transformation**:
- Replace GDP with GPH as central economic success metric
- Integrate ecological health indicators
- Include Indigenous well-being measures
- Add seven-generation impact assessments

### Regenerative Economy Principles
**Current**: Mixed market-cooperative model
**Required transformation**:
- Center reciprocity and gift economy principles
- Integrate Traditional Ecological Knowledge in economic planning
- Implement circular economy with ecological limits
- Add ceremonial governance approaches to economic decision-making

### Reparations Framework
**Current**: Minimal mention of redistribution
**Required addition**: Comprehensive reparations section including:
- Ecological reparations for environmental damage
- Colonial reparations for historical extraction
- Land rematriation economic mechanisms
- Corporate accountability frameworks

### Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs) Economic Integration
**Current**: Municipal and regional focus
**Required addition**:
- BAZ economic sovereignty protocols
- Traditional resource management integration
- Indigenous-led development models
- Cultural integrity protection in economic systems

### Specific sections needing major revision:
- **core-principles.md**: Add Indigenous economic sovereignty as foundational principle
- **local-implementation.md**: Integrate BAZ economic models
- **regional-implementation.md**: Center bioregional stewardship
- **monitoring.md**: Replace metrics with GPH indicators

## 4. Meta-Governance Framework Integration

### Economic Meta-Council
**Current**: Scattered coordination mechanisms
**Required addition**: Dedicated section on Economic Meta-Council including:
- Coordination between financial institutions, labor organizations, environmental stewards
- Cross-sector alignment protocols
- Crisis response coordination
- Democratic oversight mechanisms

### Corporate Accountability Frameworks
**Current**: Limited private sector engagement via PPPs
**Required transformation**:
- Comprehensive corporate accountability protocols
- Multinational corporation governance frameworks
- Stakeholder capitalism transition mechanisms
- Supply chain transparency requirements

### Economic Sufficiency & Circulation Principle
**Current**: Growth-oriented development model
**Required transformation**:
- Replace infinite growth model with sufficiency economics
- Implement circulation-based prosperity measures
- Add well-being indicators over GDP metrics
- Include planetary boundary constraints

### Specific sections needing addition:
- **New section**: "Meta-Governance Coordination: Economic Council and Corporate Accountability"
- **decision-protocols.md**: Add Economic Meta-Council governance
- **cross-domain.md**: Enhanced meta-governance coordination

## 6. Cross-Linking Requirements

Each revised section must include:
- **Explicit cross-references** to relevant Treaty sections (e.g., "[Global Taxation Mechanisms](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#global-taxation)")
- **Indigenous Framework integration** (e.g., "[Bioregional Autonomous Zones](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#bioregional-zones)")
- **Meta-governance coordination** (e.g., "[Economic Meta-Council](/frameworks/meta-governance#economic-coordination)")

## 7. Implementation Priority

### Phase 1 (Immediate - Core Framework Alignment)
1. index.md complete rewrite
2. core-principles.md fundamental overhaul  
3. global-implementation.md Treaty integration

### Phase 2 (Essential Integration)
4. monitoring.md GPH metrics integration
5. local-implementation.md BAZ integration
6. regional-implementation.md bioregional frameworks

### Phase 3 (New Content Creation)
7. reparations-framework.md creation
8. gph-implementation.md creation
9. economic-meta-governance.md creation

### Phase 4 (Comprehensive Cross-Linking)
10. All sections updated with Golden Triangle cross-references
11. Tools and resources alignment
12. Final coherence review

## 8. Success Criteria

The revision will be complete when:
- [ ] Framework explicitly positions itself within Golden Triangle ecosystem
- [ ] Indigenous economic sovereignty is centered throughout
- [ ] Treaty taxation mechanisms are fully integrated
- [ ] GPH Index replaces GDP as central metric
- [ ] Reparations framework is comprehensively addressed
- [ ] Meta-governance coordination is established
- [ ] All sections cross-link to relevant Golden Triangle frameworks
- [ ] Regenerative economy principles guide all mechanisms

This represents a fundamental transformation rather than incremental updates, requiring significant rewriting to align with the decolonized, Indigenous-led, and regenerative vision of the Golden Triangle frameworks.
