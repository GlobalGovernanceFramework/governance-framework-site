### Media & Information Peace Capacities

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section operationalizes the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#pillar-three) **Global Digital Governance Body** and **information integrity standards**, guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework's](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#pathways-broader-engagement) **Global Indigenous Media Network** and **Traditional storytelling sovereignty**, coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) **Sensemaking Sovereignty & Epistemic Care** principle for protecting knowledge integrity and enabling diverse ways of knowing to inform peace processes.

Media and information systems fundamentally shape conflict dynamics, either amplifying division or fostering understanding. As digital platforms accelerate narrative spread, they intensify polarization and enable information warfare while simultaneously offering unprecedented opportunities for Indigenous storytelling, Traditional Knowledge sharing, and community-controlled peace communication that honors diverse epistemologies and cultural protocols.

#### 1. Treaty-Mandated Information Integrity Framework

**Case Study**: Ukraine's Digital Ceasefire Monitoring demonstrates both digital peace potential and risks. The system successfully documented violations through citizen reports and satellite imagery while facing verification challenges and propaganda manipulation. Enhanced protocols now integrate Indigenous data sovereignty principles, Traditional Knowledge approaches to conflict verification, and Meta-Governance coordination ensuring information systems support rather than undermine broader peace efforts.

**Case Study**: Global Indigenous Media Network Success demonstrates Traditional storytelling sovereignty in practice. By 2030, Indigenous-controlled media platforms reach 500+ million people while maintaining cultural protocols and Traditional Knowledge protection. When extractive industries attempt disinformation campaigns against Indigenous territories in 2032, coordinated Indigenous media response combines Traditional storytelling, ceremonial authority, and digital platforms to expose corporate manipulation and build global solidarity, demonstrating how Traditional communication sovereignty creates resilience against information warfare.
