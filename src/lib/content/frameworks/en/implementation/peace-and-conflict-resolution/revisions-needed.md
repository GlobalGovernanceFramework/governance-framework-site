I'd be happy to help update the Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework to align it with the Golden Triangle! Let me first assess which sections need revisions based on the requirements.Based on my review of the existing Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework documents and the GitHub issue requirements, let me assess which sections need revisions for Golden Triangle alignment:

## Assessment of Required Revisions

### Current Framework Structure Analysis
The Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework currently has 36 sections organized around:
- Core principles and local/regional/global implementation
- Digital infrastructure and AI ethics
- Traditional/Indigenous peacebuilding integration  
- Structural prevention and transitional justice
- Mental health support and educational infrastructure
- Military transformation and non-state actor engagement
- Implementation challenges and timelines

### Key Alignment Gaps Identified

**1. Introduction/Preamble Revision** ✅ **HIGH PRIORITY**
- Current introduction lacks explicit positioning within Golden Triangle ecosystem
- Needs reframing as operationalization of Treaty mechanisms
- Missing connection to Indigenous Framework's restorative principles
- No reference to Meta-Governance coordination architecture

**2. Treaty Integration Gaps** ✅ **HIGH PRIORITY**  
- UNSC Veto Override mentioned but not detailed as primary unlocking mechanism
- Global Enforcement Mechanism exists but needs stronger Treaty connection
- Funding mechanisms present but need explicit Treaty taxation integration

**3. Indigenous Framework Integration Gaps** ✅ **MEDIUM-HIGH PRIORITY**
- Traditional peacebuilding mentioned but not foundational
- Earth Council role in conflict mediation unclear
- Ceremonial stewardship approaches underutilized
- Restorative justice present but not Indigenous-centered

**4. Meta-Governance Integration Gaps** ✅ **MEDIUM PRIORITY**
- Early warning systems exist but need Meta-Governance coordination layer
- Cross-domain coordination principles present but not systematized
- Peace & Security Meta-Council concept missing

## Specific Sections Requiring Major Revision:

### **Tier 1: Critical Revisions**
1. **Introduction/Preamble** - Complete rewrite for Golden Triangle positioning
2. **Core Principles** - Integration with Treaty principles and Indigenous sovereignty
3. **Global Implementation** - UNSC veto override and GEM details
4. **Peace Financing** - Treaty taxation mechanism integration

### **Tier 2: Substantial Updates**  
5. **Indigenous Integration** - Elevation to foundational chapter
6. **Structural Prevention** - Earth Council mediation authority
7. **Digital Infrastructure** - Meta-Governance coordination protocols
8. **Implementation Strategies** - Cross-framework coordination

### **Tier 3: Moderate Updates**
9. **Mental Health Support** - Indigenous healing practices centering
10. **Educational Infrastructure** - Traditional conflict transformation
11. **Local Implementation** - Ceremonial stewardship integration
12. **Monitoring & Evaluation** - Cross-framework success metrics

Would you like me to start with the **Introduction/Preamble revision** as the foundation, or would you prefer to tackle a different section first? I can draft the new content showing how the Peace framework operates as the practical implementation arm of the Treaty's peace mechanisms, guided by Indigenous wisdom and coordinated through Meta-Governance architecture.
