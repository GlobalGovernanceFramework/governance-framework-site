### Background: From Armed Conflict to Values-Based Transformation

The Colombian peace process (2010-2016) between the government and FARC (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia) provides crucial insights for post-conflict institutional rebuilding using values-based transformation principles.

**Conflict Overview**:
- **Duration**: 52-year armed conflict (1964-2016)
- **Scale**: 260,000 deaths, 7 million internally displaced persons
- **Root Values Tensions**: State authority (Blue-Fairness) vs. revolutionary justice (Red-Power) vs. rural community needs (Purple-Tradition)

### Values-Based Analysis

**Primary Value Systems Identified**:
- **Government/Military**: Blue ‚öñÔ∏è (Institutional fairness, rule of law, state authority)
- **FARC**: Red üî¥ (Revolutionary power, armed resistance) transitioning to Orange üí° (Political participation)
- **Rural Communities**: Purple üü£ (Traditional land relationships, community survival) with Green üå± (Inclusion demands)
- **Victims' Organizations**: Green üü¢ (Inclusive justice, comprehensive reparations)

**Values Integration Strategy**:
The peace process succeeded by creating mechanisms honoring all value systems rather than imposing single approaches:

1. **Honoring Blue Fairness**: Comprehensive System of Truth, Justice, Reparation and Non-Repetition (SIVJRNR)
2. **Channeling Red Power**: FARC political party formation and guaranteed congressional representation
3. **Protecting Purple Tradition**: Rural reform programs and territorial approach to peace
4. **Advancing Green Inclusion**: Comprehensive victim participation and differential approaches for ethnic minorities

### Implementation Through Values-Based Methodology

**Tier 1 (Survival) Interventions**:
- **Tradition**: Peace laboratories in territories with strong community organization
- **Power**: Bilateral ceasefire agreements with verification mechanisms
- **Fairness**: Legal framework through constitutional amendments and implementing legislation
