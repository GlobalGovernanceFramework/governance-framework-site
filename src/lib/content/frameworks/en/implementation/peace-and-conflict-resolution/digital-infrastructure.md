Digital technologies enable new approaches to peace governance while creating unprecedented risks for Indigenous communities, Traditional Knowledge, and democratic participation. The Peace Framework's digital infrastructure centers **Indigenous data sovereignty, Traditional Knowledge protection, and community technology self-determination** as foundational principles while integrating **Treaty mechanisms for global digital governance** and **Meta-Governance coordination** for cross-domain technology alignment.

Rather than imposing technological solutions on communities, the framework supports **community-controlled technology development**, **Traditional Knowledge-guided AI systems**, and **Indigenous oversight of digital peace platforms** that serve rather than extract from Traditional Territories and cultural practices.
