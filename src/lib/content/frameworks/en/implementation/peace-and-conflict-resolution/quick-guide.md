### Implementation Note

These enhanced lite guides serve as **entry points to systemic transformation** rather than standalone reform proposals. They help stakeholders understand how their peace work contributes to broader governance evolution guided by Indigenous wisdom, enabled by Treaty mechanisms, and coordinated through Meta-Governance systems.

**Beginning with Relationships**: All implementation starts with respectful relationship-building with Indigenous communities in your bioregion, following appropriate cultural protocols and Traditional Territory recognition. No peace work should proceed without Indigenous guidance and consent.

**Systems Integration**: The guides emphasize how local peace work connects to planetary transformation, helping practitioners see their contributions to the larger project of evolving from conflict-generating to peace-generating civilization.

**Continuous Learning**: Each guide includes pathways for ongoing education, skill development, and network participation, ensuring that initial engagement leads to deeper integration with the Golden Triangle ecosystem.

**Access the Complete Guide Collection**: All Peace & Conflict Resolution Lite Guides with Golden Triangle integration are available in the enhanced [Peace & Conflict Resolution Seed Kit](/frameworks/tools/peace/seed-kit-golden-triangle-en.zip), providing comprehensive resources for peace transformation at every level.
