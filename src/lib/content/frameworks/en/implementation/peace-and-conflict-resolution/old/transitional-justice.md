### Transitional Justice & Reconciliation

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section operationalizes the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#pillar-three) **Universal Jurisdiction and International Courts** and **Planetary Rights Framework**, guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework's](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) **Traditional healing practices**, **Earth Council authority**, and **restorative justice principles**, coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) **Peace & Regeneration principle** for healing-centered approaches grounded in relational accountability across all governance domains.

Addressing past violence requires sophisticated governance approaches that honor Traditional Knowledge of healing and reconciliation while providing the legal authority and enforcement mechanisms necessary for accountability. The integration of Indigenous restorative principles with Treaty-mandated international justice creates comprehensive frameworks for transformation rather than mere punishment, prioritizing community healing and relationship repair over retributive approaches.
