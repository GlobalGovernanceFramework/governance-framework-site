### Hybrid & Non-State Actor Engagement

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section operationalizes the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#pillar-three) **Global Enforcement Mechanism** and **Universal Jurisdiction frameworks**, guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework's](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) **Traditional Authority recognition**, **Earth Council mediation**, and **bioregional governance**, coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) **Polycentric Coordination principle** ensuring engagement with diverse actors honors Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional governance systems, and community self-determination while preventing capture by colonial or extractive interests.

**Case Study**: The Colombia peace process with FARC demonstrates comprehensive approaches to armed non-state actors enhanced with Indigenous guidance. Traditional Authority mediation, Earth Council consultation, and bioregional governance integration created innovative mechanisms including Indigenous territorial councils, Traditional law recognition, and community-controlled reintegration. Enhanced protocols now include Traditional ceremony for combatant transformation, Elder-guided demobilization, and Sacred Territory protection, showing how Indigenous wisdom can inform complex non-state actor engagement while maintaining accountability and community protection.

**Case Study**: Traditional Authority recognition in various Indigenous territories demonstrates legitimate non-state governance systems operating effectively across colonial boundaries. Haudenosaunee passport recognition, Sámi Parliament coordination across Nordic countries, and Aboriginal Australian Traditional Owner recognition show how Traditional governance systems can provide legitimate alternatives to colonial state authority while maintaining community accountability and cultural sovereignty.
