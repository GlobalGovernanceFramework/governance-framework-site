# Whistleblower Protection in Authoritarian Contexts

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section operationalizes the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#pillar-three) **Universal Jurisdiction enforcement** and **Global Digital Governance Body** protections, guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework's](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#key-mechanisms) **Indigenous Data Sovereignty** and **Traditional Knowledge protection protocols**, coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) **Sensemaking Sovereignty & Epistemic Care** principle for protecting truth-telling while honoring Traditional protocols for knowledge sharing and community-controlled information governance.

Whistleblowing serves as a crucial mechanism for exposing corruption, human rights abuses, and planetary crimes in conflict and authoritarian settings. However, individuals reporting wrongdoing in these contexts face exceptional risks requiring sophisticated protection that honors Indigenous data sovereignty, Traditional Knowledge protocols, and community-controlled information sharing while providing the legal authority and technological infrastructure necessary for effective truth-telling and accountability.
