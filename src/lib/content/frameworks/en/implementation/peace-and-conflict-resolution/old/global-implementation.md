Global conflict resolution transforms from great power competition to **planetary cooperation** guided by **Indigenous wisdom, Earth Council authority, and Traditional Ecological Knowledge** as the foundation for global peace governance. The Treaty for Our Only Home provides revolutionary institutional mechanisms—**UNSC Veto Override, Global Enforcement Mechanism, and Global Taxation**—that enable effective global action while ensuring these mechanisms serve **Indigenous sovereignty, bioregional autonomy, and Traditional Territory protection** rather than perpetuating colonial domination.

The Peace Framework's global implementation centers **Earth Council planetary guidance**, utilizes **Treaty mechanisms for institutional transformation**, and employs **Meta-Governance coordination** to ensure that global peace infrastructure serves regenerative relationships between humans, ecosystems, and future generations rather than extractive relationships that generate the conflicts they claim to resolve.
