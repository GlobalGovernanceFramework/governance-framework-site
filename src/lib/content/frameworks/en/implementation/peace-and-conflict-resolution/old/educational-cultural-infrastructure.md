### Educational & Cultural Peace Infrastructure

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section operationalizes the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#pillar-four) **Global Public Goods Fund education investment** and **Global Civic Curriculum**, guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework's](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#pathways-broader-engagement) **Traditional Knowledge transmission**, **Indigenous pedagogy**, and **ceremonial learning**, coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) **Intergenerational Justice principle** ensuring educational systems serve seven-generation thinking and diverse ways of knowing rather than imposing colonial knowledge hierarchies.
