# Youth Peace Action Guide

## Introduction
The *Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework* is a plan to turn conflicts into opportunities for unity, and youth are key to making it happen! This guide is for young people, educators, and community groups who want to build peace in their schools, neighborhoods, or online. **Now enhanced with the Golden Triangle integration**, you'll learn how your peace actions connect to **Treaty mechanisms that unlock global change**, **Indigenous wisdom that has sustained peace for thousands of years**, and **Meta-Governance coordination** that links your local work to planetary transformation. 

**Your Power in the Golden Triangle**: As a young peace leader, you're not just organizing campaigns—you're **implementing Treaty democracy through Global Citizens' Initiative**, **learning from Indigenous youth who are revitalizing Traditional Knowledge**, and **participating in Meta-Governance councils** where your voice shapes decisions affecting your future. Your generation has **binding authority** on long-term peace decisions through **Youth Councils with real power** across all three frameworks.
