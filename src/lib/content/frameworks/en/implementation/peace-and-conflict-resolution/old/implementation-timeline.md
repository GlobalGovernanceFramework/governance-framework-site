### Implementation Timeline

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section operationalizes the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home) **phased implementation approach** across multiple timescales, guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework's](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#implementation-timeline) **Traditional governance succession** and **seven-generation accountability**, coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance#implementation) **temporal layering** and **adaptive learning loops** for ensuring peace transformation serves Traditional Territory stewardship, Indigenous sovereignty, and community self-determination across immediate, generational, and seven-generation timescales.
