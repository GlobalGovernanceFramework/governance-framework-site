### Structural Conflict Prevention

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section operationalizes the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#pillar-four) **Resource Justice Mechanisms** and **Global Public Goods Fund**, guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework's](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#core-principles) **bioregional governance**, **Traditional Territory sovereignty**, and **seven-generation accountability**, coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) **Equity & Inclusion** and **Planetary Stewardship** principles for addressing root causes of conflict through Indigenous-led resource justice, Traditional governance recognition, and community-controlled development that prevents violence while strengthening Traditional Territory stewardship and cultural sovereignty.

Addressing the root causes of conflict requires governance approaches focused on underlying drivers of violence while recognizing that many conflicts emerge from colonial displacement, Traditional Territory violations, resource extraction, and cultural destruction. Effective prevention honors Indigenous sovereignty, supports Traditional governance systems, and ensures resource distribution serves community wellbeing and ecological integrity rather than extractive profit maximization.
