I'll revise the Peace-Business Integration section to align it with the Golden Triangle framework. Here's the updated version:

title: Peace-Business Integration
section: peace-business-integration

### Peace-Business Integration

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section operationalizes the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#pillar-four) **Global Taxation and Corporate Accountability** mechanisms, guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework's](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#key-mechanisms) **Traditional economic systems**, **Free, Prior, and Informed Consent 2.0**, and **reparations frameworks**, coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) **Economic Sufficiency & Circulation principle** for ensuring business serves community wellbeing, Traditional Territory stewardship, and regenerative economic relationships rather than extractive profit maximization.

The private sector plays a pivotal role in both perpetuating and resolving conflicts, particularly in Traditional Territories and resource-rich regions. While businesses can drive regenerative economic relationships and support Indigenous sovereignty, unchecked corporate activities—especially extractive industries, technology corporations, and private security—can exacerbate conflicts through Traditional Territory violations, Traditional Knowledge appropriation, and extractive exploitation that requires comprehensive accountability guided by Indigenous governance and Treaty enforcement mechanisms.
