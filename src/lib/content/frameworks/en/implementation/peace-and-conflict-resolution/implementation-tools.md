**Technology as Sacred Practice**: These tools transform from mere instruments into extensions of our highest values when developed with Indigenous wisdom, community control, and deep respect for the sacred relationships that make peace possible. The future of peace technology lies not in replacing human wisdom with artificial intelligence, but in creating digital tools that amplify our capacity for understanding, empathy, and regenerative relationship with all life.
