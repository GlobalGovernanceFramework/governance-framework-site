### Military & Security Transformation

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section operationalizes the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#pillar-three) **Global Enforcement Mechanism** and **cooperative security arrangements**, guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework's](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#core-principles) **Traditional protection models** and **warrior society integration**, coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) **Peace & Regeneration principle** for transforming military structures from violence-based dominance systems into community protection and ecological stewardship organizations that serve Indigenous sovereignty and bioregional governance.

A comprehensive peace and conflict resolution framework must address military structures while recognizing that security concerns remain legitimate, requiring transformation from colonial military systems toward Indigenous-inspired protection models that prioritize community defense, Traditional Territory stewardship, and cooperative security arrangements guided by Traditional Knowledge and Earth Council authority.
