### Peace Financing & Resource Mobilization

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section operationalizes the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#pillar-four) **Global Taxation and Payment for Global Public Goods Fund**, guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework's](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#key-mechanisms) **reparations frameworks**, **community-controlled economic development**, and **Traditional economic systems**, coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) **Economic Sufficiency & Circulation principle** for ensuring peace funding serves Traditional Territory stewardship, Indigenous sovereignty, and regenerative economic relationships rather than perpetuating colonial extraction and dependency.

Sustainable peacebuilding requires dedicated financial mechanisms that ensure consistent, flexible, and appropriate funding while recognizing that many peace challenges emerge from economic injustice, Traditional Territory extraction, and colonial financial systems. Effective funding honors Indigenous economic sovereignty, supports Traditional governance systems, and ensures resources flow to community-controlled peacebuilding that strengthens rather than undermines Traditional Territories and cultural sovereignty.

Indigenous communities direct funding toward Traditional conflict resolution, ceremonial healing, and Traditional Territory stewardship rather than external programming, showing how peace financing can serve Indigenous sovereignty while achieving effective conflict prevention and resolution.

**Case Study**: Traditional Territory climate reparations demonstrate innovative peace financing serving Indigenous sovereignty while addressing climate conflicts. Carbon tax revenues support Traditional Territory climate adaptation under Indigenous governance control, Traditional Knowledge climate integration, and sacred site protection. Enhanced with bioregional coordination and youth authority, these funding mechanisms prevent climate conflicts while strengthening Traditional Territory stewardship and cultural sovereignty.
