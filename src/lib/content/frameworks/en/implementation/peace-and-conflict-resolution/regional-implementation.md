**Estimated Reading Time**: 20 minutes

Regional conflict resolution transforms from nation-state diplomacy to **bioregional coordination** that honors Traditional Territories, watershed boundaries, and ecosystem relationships crossing colonial borders. The Peace Framework's regional implementation centers **Indigenous confederacy models**, **Earth Council mediation authority**, and **Traditional Ecological Knowledge** as the foundation for regional cooperation while integrating **Treaty mechanisms** for institutional support and **Meta-Governance coordination** for cross-domain alignment.

Rather than reinforcing colonial boundaries that fragment Traditional Territories and ecosystems, regional peace governance supports **Traditional Territory networks**, **watershed governance**, and **bioregional coordination** that align human cooperation with ecological relationships and Indigenous sovereignty.

**Case Study Enhancement**: The Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) demonstrates regional conflict prevention potential that could be enhanced through Indigenous governance integration. ECOWAS's early warning systems, preventive diplomacy, and peacekeeping succeed through regional coordination. The Peace Framework's bioregional approach would enhance this by recognizing Traditional Territories that cross colonial boundaries, integrating Traditional African governance systems, and utilizing Traditional Ecological Knowledge for conflict prevention and resource management.

**Case Study Integration**: The Sámi Parliament demonstrates Indigenous governance across colonial borders, coordinating reindeer herding, language preservation, and Traditional Territory management across Norway, Sweden, Finland, and Russia.
