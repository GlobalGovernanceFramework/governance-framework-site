### Cross-Domain Integration

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section demonstrates how the Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework operates within the comprehensive ecosystem of the [Treaty for Our Only Home](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home), guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge), and coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework](/frameworks/meta-governance) to ensure peace efforts align seamlessly with health, climate, economic, technological, and cultural governance while honoring Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Territory stewardship, and seven-generation accountability.

Peace and conflict resolution cannot operate in isolation from other governance domainsâ€”the polycrisis reveals that climate, health, economic, technological, and cultural systems are interconnected, requiring integrated approaches that honor Traditional Knowledge, support bioregional governance, and ensure peace efforts strengthen rather than undermine Indigenous sovereignty and ecological integrity.

Enhanced protocols include Earth Council mediation, Traditional water ceremonies, and bioregional governance showing how cross-domain coordination can honor Traditional Knowledge while building peace.

**Case Study**: Climate-health-peace integration in Traditional Territories demonstrates comprehensive cross-domain coordination. Traditional healing systems support climate adaptation, Indigenous early warning prevents health conflicts, and Traditional Territory governance coordinates across domains while maintaining community sovereignty. Enhanced with Treaty funding and Meta-governance coordination, these examples show how cross-domain integration can serve Indigenous sovereignty while addressing interconnected challenges.

This revision positions Cross-Domain Integration as the demonstration of how the Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework operates within the Golden Triangle ecosystem, showing how peace efforts can be coordinated across all governance domains while maintaining Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Knowledge authority, and community self-determination. The integration ensures peace building serves comprehensive community wellbeing and ecological integrity rather than isolated programming that ignores interconnected challenges and Traditional Territory governance.
