### Mediating Climate & Resource Conflicts

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section operationalizes the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#pillar-four) **Carbon Tax and Climate Adaptation Authority** and **Payment for Global Public Goods Fund**, guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework's](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#core-principles) **bioregional governance** and **Traditional Ecological Knowledge**, coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) **Planetary Stewardship principle** and **Climate-Peace Meta-Council** for integrated response to environmental drivers of conflict.

As climate change and resource scarcity intensify, they increasingly intersect with migration, biodiversity loss, and Traditional Territory rights, driving conflict risks while creating opportunities for Indigenous-led regenerative governance. The polycrisis reveals that environmental degradation, forced displacement, and resource conflicts form interconnected systems requiring integrated approaches that honor Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Ecological Knowledge, and bioregional stewardship.
