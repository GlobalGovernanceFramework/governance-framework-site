The Peace Framework's governance architecture creates institutional structures that operationalize regenerative peace transformation while maintaining **Indigenous sovereignty**, **democratic accountability**, and **ecological integrity**. Unlike traditional international institutions that often perpetuate colonial power structures, this architecture intentionally **centers Indigenous leadership**, **distributes authority across multiple scales**, and **aligns institutions with bioregional relationships** rather than arbitrary political boundaries.

The architecture operates through the **Golden Triangle integration**, where Treaty mechanisms provide institutional authority, Indigenous wisdom guides institutional purpose and process, and Meta-governance coordination enables seamless operation across all governance domains. This creates unprecedented institutional capacity for preventing conflicts, responding to crises, and building regenerative post-conflict systems.
