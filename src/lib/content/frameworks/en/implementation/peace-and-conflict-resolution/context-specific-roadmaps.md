### Context-Specific Implementation Roadmaps

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section operationalizes the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home) **adaptive implementation mechanisms** across diverse political, cultural, and technological contexts, guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework's](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components) **bioregional governance**, **Traditional Territory adaptation**, and **ceremonial stewardship protocols**, coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) **Cultural Integration** and **context-sensitive coordination** ensuring peace implementation honors Traditional governance, respects Indigenous sovereignty, and adapts to diverse cultural contexts while maintaining framework integrity.

The Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework recognizes that peace governance must adapt to diverse political, cultural, and technological contexts while maintaining core principles of Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Knowledge authority, and bioregional stewardship. Implementation roadmaps provide culturally appropriate pathways that honor Traditional governance systems, support community self-determination, and ensure peace efforts strengthen rather than undermine Indigenous Territories and Traditional Authority.

This revision positions Context-Specific Implementation Roadmaps as the comprehensive guide for adapting Golden Triangle frameworks across diverse contexts while maintaining Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Knowledge authority, and community self-determination. The roadmaps ensure that contextual adaptation serves rather than undermines Traditional Territories, Indigenous governance, and cultural sovereignty while providing effective peace implementation across political, technological, and cultural diversity.
