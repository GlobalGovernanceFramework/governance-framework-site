### Emerging Technologies for Peace

**Golden Triangle Integration**: This section operationalizes the [Treaty for Our Only Home's](/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#pillar-three) **emerging technology governance mechanisms** and **peace technology standards**, guided by the [Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework's](/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#key-mechanisms) **Traditional Knowledge-AI integration** and **community technology sovereignty protocols**, coordinated through the [Meta-Governance Framework's](/frameworks/meta-governance#principles) **Human-Centered AI principle** and **innovation governance** for responsible technology development serving planetary peace.

Beyond established digital tools, cutting-edge technologies offer unprecedented possibilities for conflict prevention and resolution when developed under Indigenous guidance, Treaty governance standards, and Meta-Governance coordination that ensures innovation serves rather than undermines community self-determination and ecological wellbeing.
