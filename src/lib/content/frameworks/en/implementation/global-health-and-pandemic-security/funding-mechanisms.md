*In the aftermath of the 2014-2016 Ebola crisis, a profound question emerged from West African communities: "Why must we wait for outside money to heal our own people?" The traditional healing systems that had maintained community health for centuries required no external funding—they were sustained by community relationships, reciprocal care, and the understanding that health is a commons to be shared rather than a commodity to be purchased. The funding mechanisms of the Global Health & Pandemic Security Framework emerge from this wisdom: creating economic systems that honor health as relationship while generating the resources necessary for planetary health security. Through Hearts currency, Leaves tokens, and community-controlled funding, these mechanisms ensure that money serves healing rather than healing serving money.*

### Beyond Extractive Health Finance

The funding mechanisms operate through regenerative economic principles that create value through care, healing, and ecological restoration rather than extracting value from illness, poverty, and environmental destruction.

**Care as Currency**: The framework recognizes care work, traditional healing, and community health activities as valuable economic contributions through Hearts currency, ensuring that the foundation of health—human relationships and traditional knowledge—receives economic recognition and support.

**Ecological Health Investment**: Leaves tokens provide economic incentives for ecosystem restoration, traditional agriculture, and environmental health activities that prevent pandemic risk at its ecological source while supporting Indigenous land stewardship and traditional knowledge application.

**Community Wealth Building**: Health funding mechanisms designed to build community wealth and traditional knowledge capacity rather than creating dependency on external aid or corporate health systems that extract value from communities.

**Intergenerational Wealth**: Economic systems that create wealth for future generations rather than imposing costs on young people and unborn generations, ensuring that health investments serve seven-generation thinking and intergenerational equity.

**Commons-Based Finance**: Health resources treated as commons to be shared rather than commodities to be hoarded, with funding mechanisms that strengthen rather than undermine community control over health systems and traditional knowledge.

### Hearts-Leaves Economic Ecosystem

---

The funding mechanisms create a regenerative economic ecosystem that honors health as relationship while generating the resources necessary for planetary health security. Through Hearts currency, Leaves tokens, and community-controlled funding, these mechanisms ensure that economic systems serve healing rather than extracting from communities and traditional knowledge.

These funding mechanisms recognize that sustainable health security requires economic systems that support rather than undermine the social and cultural relationships that constitute community health. By creating economic value through care, healing, and ecological restoration, they demonstrate that prosperity and health are not competing values but complementary necessities for planetary wellbeing.

The funding mechanisms become real through community implementation—through traditional healers earning Hearts for their healing work, through communities receiving Leaves for ecosystem restoration, through debt relief supporting community health sovereignty, and through all of us choosing economic systems that serve life rather than exploiting it.
