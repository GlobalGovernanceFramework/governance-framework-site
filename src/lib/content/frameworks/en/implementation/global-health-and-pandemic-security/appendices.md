## <a id="appendix-a-glossary"></a>Appendix A: Glossary of Key Terms

### Core Framework Terms

**Biosphere Health Index (BHI)**: Comprehensive metric integrating human, animal, and ecosystem health indicators as replacement for GDP-focused development measures. The BHI includes ecological integrity (40%), human flourishing (30%), animal and interspecies wellbeing (20%), and sacred/spiritual health (10%) indicators, with community-controlled validation processes and cultural adaptation protocols.

**Community Health Legions**: Localized, community-based health workers integrating traditional knowledge with contemporary health skills under community control. Legions operate through traditional governance processes, receive certification through community-controlled standards, and maintain authority over their training, deployment, and accountability systems.

**Free, Prior, and Informed Consent 2.0 (FPIC 2.0)**: Enhanced protocols ensuring Indigenous communities maintain genuine authority over health interventions rather than consultative participation. FPIC 2.0 includes community veto power, ongoing consent modification rights, traditional knowledge protection, economic sovereignty safeguards, and cultural protocol integration requirements.

**Global Health Security Council (GHSC)**: Central coordination body for health emergencies with binding authority during crises while maintaining democratic oversight and community sovereignty. The GHSC includes 50% Global South representation, 25% youth delegates, 40% Indigenous representatives, and operates under community accountability mechanisms with automatic sunset clauses for emergency powers.

**Health Emergency Corps (HEC)**: Professional rapid-response teams deployable globally within 72 hours with cultural competency and traditional knowledge integration requirements. HEC teams include traditional healers, cultural mediators, youth members, and operate under community-initiated deployment protocols with local authority guidance.

**Health Sanctuary**: Pilot implementation sites demonstrating complete framework integration with community sovereignty and traditional knowledge protection. Health Sanctuaries serve as proving grounds for community-controlled health governance while providing immediate benefits to participating communities through enhanced health access and cultural recognition.

**Hearts Currency**: Alternative economic system supporting community health workers and traditional healers through community-controlled value exchange. Hearts enable communities to reward health work that serves traditional values and community priorities while participating in broader economic networks without dependence on external monetary systems.

**Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC)**: WHO designation triggering coordinated international response under framework protocols. PHEIC declarations under the framework require community consultation, traditional knowledge integration, youth council review for intergenerational impacts, and democratic oversight with community authority over local response measures.

**Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)**: Indigenous and traditional knowledge systems about health, healing, and ecological relationships maintained through community transmission. TEK includes traditional medicine, ecological health indicators, seasonal health protocols, traditional healing practices, and spiritual approaches to health and healing maintained through traditional governance and knowledge transmission systems.

**Time-to-Care Equity Ratio**: Metric measuring differential access to health interventions between Global North and Global South populations. The ratio tracks disparities in vaccine access, therapeutic availability, diagnostic capability, and health infrastructure, with framework targets of less than 30 days differential for essential health interventions.

### Governance and Participation Terms

**Planetary Health Assemblies**: Regional citizen bodies ensuring democratic legitimacy and community accountability in health governance. Assemblies include randomly selected citizens with guaranteed representation for marginalized communities, authority to review GHSC decisions, community veto rights for non-emergency interventions, and community scorecard authority for rating intervention quality.

**Youth Health Justice Councils**: Decision-making bodies where young people aged 16-25 exercise binding authority over health policies affecting their generation. Councils have veto power over decisions with harmful intergenerational impacts, authority over long-term health infrastructure, and binding consultation rights for emergency measures affecting future generations.

**Zoonotic Hotspot Guardians**: Community-based monitors trained to detect and respond to wildlife-human health interface risks using traditional ecological knowledge and contemporary surveillance tools. Guardians operate under community authority with traditional knowledge integration and provide early warning for pandemic prevention through ecological monitoring.

**Community Scorecards**: Evaluation tools controlled by communities to assess health intervention quality, cultural appropriateness, and community benefit. Scorecards include community-designed indicators, traditional knowledge integration assessment, youth satisfaction measures, and community sovereignty compliance evaluation with public reporting and improvement requirements.

### Economic and Resource Terms

**Pandemic Prevention Fund**: Financing mechanism supporting upstream prevention, community health systems, and reparations for colonial health harms through planetary health taxation of high-risk industries. The fund includes community-controlled allocation, Indigenous-led reparations programs, youth innovation funding, and health commons dividend distribution.

**Patent Buyout Pool**: Mechanism for purchasing and open-sourcing pharmaceutical patents to ensure essential medicines remain accessible as public goods. The pool operates through government financing, community-controlled oversight, fast-track regulatory processes, and global manufacturing coordination with community-owned pharmaceutical cooperatives.

**Health Commons Dividend**: Direct payments to communities protecting health commons including ecosystems critical to pandemic prevention, traditional knowledge systems, and community health infrastructure. Dividends reward ecosystem protection, traditional knowledge preservation, community health work, and health commons stewardship through community-controlled distribution systems.

**Debt-for-Health Swaps**: Programs redirecting debt payments toward community-controlled healthcare infrastructure in low-income countries. Swaps prioritize climate-health co-benefits, gender-equitable outcomes, community sovereignty, and traditional knowledge integration while addressing exploitative debt relationships.

### Technology and Innovation Terms

**Global Pathogen Surveillance Network**: AI-powered early warning system integrating traditional ecological knowledge with contemporary disease monitoring for pandemic prevention. The network includes community-controlled data sovereignty, Indigenous knowledge integration, real-time pathogen weather maps, and space-based environmental monitoring with community technology sovereignty protections.

**Community Technology Sovereignty**: Community authority over health technology adoption, deployment, and governance including right to reject inappropriate technologies, control over community data, authority over AI system deployment, and support for community-controlled technology alternatives that serve traditional values and community priorities.

**Indigenous Data Sovereignty**: Community control over data collection, storage, use, and sharing in Indigenous territories following CARE Principles (Collective Benefit, Authority to Control, Responsibility, Ethics). Sovereignty includes community-controlled research protocols, traditional knowledge protection, benefit-sharing requirements, and anti-appropriation enforcement.

**AI Bias Prevention Frameworks**: Technical and governance protocols preventing algorithmic discrimination in health diagnostics, resource allocation, and surveillance systems. Frameworks include community-controlled auditing, Indigenous oversight for TEK-related data, bias detection requirements, corrective action protocols, and community technology sovereignty protections.
