*In 1946, the World Health Organization declared that "health is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity." This vision was revolutionary for its time, yet it remained incomplete—treating health as a human possession rather than a relationship, focusing on individual well-being rather than the web of connections that sustain all life. The Universal Declaration of Health Rights emerges from Indigenous wisdom traditions that understand health as the sacred flow of life itself through communities, ecosystems, and generations. It recognizes that human health cannot be separated from the health of the waters, soils, forests, and all beings with whom we share this Earth.*

## <a id="preamble"></a>Preamble: Health as Sacred Relationship

### Recognizing Our Interconnection

We, the peoples of the Earth, recognizing that health is not a commodity to be bought and sold but a sacred relationship to be honored and nurtured, declare these rights as foundational to any governance system that claims to serve life. Health emerges from the quality of our relationships—with ourselves, our communities, our ancestors and descendants, and the living Earth that sustains us all.

This Declaration emerges from the wisdom of Indigenous peoples who have maintained healthy relationships with their territories for millennia, from the struggles of communities worldwide fighting for health justice, from the insights of healers and health workers who understand that healing requires addressing root causes rather than just symptoms, and from the voices of young people demanding governance systems that serve their future rather than destroying it.

We reject the colonial understanding of health as individual medical treatment and embrace the ancient truth that health is collective flourishing within ecological relationship. We reject the capitalist understanding of health as private good and embrace the understanding that health is commons to be protected and shared. We reject the anthropocentric understanding of health as human-only concern and embrace the understanding that human health depends absolutely on the health of all life.

### The Context of Crisis and Possibility

This Declaration emerges at a moment of unprecedented health crisis and unprecedented possibility for transformation. The COVID-19 pandemic revealed the devastating consequences of health systems based on profit rather than care, nationalism rather than solidarity, and expert control rather than community sovereignty. Yet the pandemic also revealed the resilience of communities that maintained traditional knowledge, the power of mutual aid networks, and the possibility of global cooperation when human survival depends on it.

Climate change, biodiversity loss, and social inequality continue to undermine the ecological and social foundations of health while corporate-controlled health systems extract profit from illness rather than creating conditions for collective flourishing. Meanwhile, Indigenous communities demonstrate daily that other approaches are possible—health systems based on reciprocity rather than extraction, traditional knowledge rather than corporate science, and community control rather than distant authority.

The tools for health transformation now exist: digital technologies that can serve community sovereignty rather than corporate surveillance, scientific understanding that validates traditional knowledge, and global communication networks that enable coordination without centralization. What remains is the political will to choose health systems that serve life rather than profit, communities rather than corporations, and future generations rather than immediate gain.

## <a id="four-pillars"></a>The Four Pillars of Health Rights

### Pillar I: Health as Universal Right and Sacred Birthright

> *"Every being has the inherent right to the conditions that support health and healing, including clean air, pure water, nutritious food, safe shelter, and access to both traditional and contemporary medicine."*

**Foundational Recognition**: Health is not earned through wealth, citizenship, or moral worthiness but belongs to every being by virtue of their existence within the web of life. This right extends beyond humans to include the plant and animal communities, watersheds, and ecosystems with whom we share responsibility for planetary health.

**Essential Conditions for Health**:
- **Clean Air**: Atmospheric conditions free from industrial pollution, fossil fuel emissions, and toxic chemicals that cause respiratory disease, cancer, and developmental harm
- **Pure Water**: Access to clean drinking water, unpolluted watersheds, and healthy aquatic ecosystems as the foundation of all life and health
- **Nutritious Food**: Access to culturally appropriate, ecologically sustainable food produced through regenerative agriculture that supports rather than degrades ecosystem health
- **Safe Shelter**: Housing that provides protection from the elements while maintaining connection to natural systems and community relationships
- **Healing Access**: Availability of both traditional medicine systems and contemporary medical care based on community need rather than ability to pay

**Traditional Knowledge Integration**: Recognition that many Indigenous and traditional communities have maintained sophisticated understanding of these essential conditions for thousands of years, and that their knowledge is essential for creating health systems that serve rather than undermine ecological relationship.

**Contemporary Violations**: Current economic systems that treat air, water, land, and healing knowledge as commodities to be bought and sold rather than commons to be protected systematically violate this fundamental right, creating the conditions for pandemic risk and health inequality.

**Implementation Requirements**: Health governance systems must prioritize protection and restoration of these essential conditions over economic profits, corporate interests, or narrow national advantage, recognizing that no individual or community can be healthy within systems that poison the foundations of life itself.

### Pillar II: Community Health Sovereignty and Self-Determination

> *"Communities, especially Indigenous peoples, have the right to control their own health systems, traditional healing practices, and participation in health governance without external coercion or interference."*

**Sovereignty Recognition**: Community health sovereignty means that communities have genuine authority over health decisions affecting their territories, their bodies, and their traditional knowledge rather than being subjects of health interventions designed by distant authorities.

**Indigenous Health Sovereignty**: Indigenous peoples, as the original inhabitants and traditional knowledge keepers of their territories, have inherent sovereignty over their health systems that cannot be diminished by colonial governments or international health authorities. This includes:
- **Traditional Healing Authority**: Recognition of traditional healers as legitimate health practitioners with authority over their practice methods, patient relationships, and knowledge transmission
- **Ceremonial Health Practices**: Protection of spiritual and ceremonial practices essential for community health and healing, including access to sacred sites and medicinal plants
- **Research Sovereignty**: Community control over health research conducted in their territories, including authority over research design, data ownership, and benefit sharing
- **Economic Health Independence**: Authority to develop health economic systems based on traditional values rather than being forced into cash economies that undermine traditional medicine access

**Community Self-Determination**: All communities have the right to design health systems that reflect their values, traditions, and understanding of health and healing rather than being forced to accept standardized interventions that ignore cultural knowledge and community priorities.

**Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC 2.0)**: Enhanced consent protocols that go beyond consultation to ensure communities have genuine veto power over health interventions, with ongoing authority to modify or withdraw consent based on implementation experience.

**Democratic Health Governance**: Community participation in health governance through genuine decision-making authority rather than token consultation, with special representation for Indigenous peoples, women, youth, and marginalized populations most affected by health decisions.

**Protection from Coercion**: Communities cannot be forced to accept health interventions through economic pressure, legal threats, or denial of essential services, ensuring that health choices remain voluntary and community-controlled.

### Pillar III: Intergenerational Health Justice and Seven-Generation Responsibility

> *"Present generations have the responsibility to ensure health decisions serve the wellbeing of children not yet born and protect the ecological foundations that sustain all life across generations."*

**Seven-Generation Accountability**: All health governance decisions must consider their impacts on seven generations (approximately 200 years) into the future, prioritizing long-term ecological health and social well-being over short-term economic or political gains.

**Youth Authority in Health Governance**: Young people aged 16-25 have binding authority over health policies that will primarily affect their generation, including climate-health adaptation, environmental health protection, and health system development that they will inherit and operate.

**Future Generations Legal Standing**: Youth advocates and appointed representatives can bring legal challenges on behalf of future generations affected by current health decisions, ensuring that those who cannot speak for themselves have voice in health governance.

**Ecological Health Protection**: Recognition that the health of future generations depends absolutely on maintaining healthy ecosystems, stable climate, and biodiversity, requiring health governance that addresses environmental destruction as a fundamental health threat.

**Traditional Knowledge Transmission**: Support for Indigenous and traditional communities to maintain and transmit health knowledge across generations, recognizing that traditional medicine systems often provide more sustainable and effective approaches to health than contemporary industrial medicine.

**Economic Justice Across Generations**: Health economic systems that do not impose debt burdens or environmental costs on future generations, ensuring that the costs of current health decisions are borne by those who benefit from them rather than displaced onto children not yet born.

**Cultural Continuity**: Protection of cultural practices, languages, and knowledge systems essential for community health that are threatened by forced assimilation, environmental destruction, or economic displacement.

**Climate Health Adaptation**: Health systems designed to address the health impacts of climate change that will primarily affect future generations, including extreme weather health effects, vector-borne disease expansion, and climate migration health needs.

### Pillar IV: One Health Integration and Ecological Relationship

> *"Human health, animal health, and ecosystem health are inseparable, requiring governance systems that address the health of the whole rather than treating symptoms in isolation."*

**Ecological Health Foundation**: Recognition that human health depends absolutely on healthy ecosystems, clean watersheds, stable climate, and biodiversity, making environmental protection a fundamental health issue rather than a separate concern.

**Animal Health Justice**: Recognition that the health and well-being of animal communities is intrinsically valuable and essential for ecosystem health, requiring governance systems that address industrial agriculture, habitat destruction, and animal exploitation as health issues.

**Planetary Boundary Health**: Understanding that human activities must remain within ecological limits that maintain Earth system stability, making planetary boundary compliance a requirement for sustainable health systems.

**Traditional Ecological Knowledge Integration**: Recognition that Indigenous and traditional communities possess sophisticated understanding of ecological relationships essential for maintaining health, and that this knowledge must inform rather than supplement scientific approaches to health and healing.

**Zoonotic Disease Prevention**: Addressing pandemic risk through protection of wildlife habitat, transformation of industrial agriculture, and support for traditional land management that maintains healthy relationships between human and animal communities.

**Ecosystem Health Monitoring**: Health surveillance systems that monitor ecosystem health indicators as early warning systems for human health threats, recognizing that environmental degradation often precedes human disease outbreaks.

**Right to Healthy Environment**: Legal recognition that healthy environment is a prerequisite for human health, creating enforceable rights to clean air, pure water, healthy soil, and protection from toxic contamination.

**Regenerative Health Economics**: Economic systems that support rather than undermine ecological health, treating ecosystem services as essential infrastructure rather than free resources to be exploited for private profit.

**Interspecies Health Councils**: Governance mechanisms that include advocacy for animal and plant communities in health decisions, recognizing that human health decisions affect the health of all beings within shared ecosystems.

## <a id="implementation-principles"></a>Implementation Principles

### Participatory Implementation

The Declaration becomes real through community participation rather than top-down mandates. Implementation must be:

**Community-Led**: Communities design their own approaches to implementing Declaration principles based on their cultural values, traditional knowledge, and local conditions rather than following standardized models imposed from outside.

**Culturally Adapted**: Implementation approaches that honor diverse traditional medicine systems, spiritual practices, and community governance methods rather than forcing all communities to adopt Western biomedical approaches.

---

The Universal Declaration of Health Rights provides the ethical foundation for transforming health governance from systems that generate profit to systems that generate healing, from systems that concentrate power to systems that serve communities, from systems that extract from traditional knowledge to systems that honor Indigenous wisdom as essential for planetary health.

This Declaration becomes real not through government ratification but through community implementation—through traditional healers reclaiming their authority, through communities organizing for health commons protection, through young people demanding intergenerational health justice, and through all of us choosing to understand health as sacred relationship rather than private commodity.

The Declaration recognizes that health transformation requires not just better medical care but fundamental transformation of the economic and political systems that determine whether communities have access to clean air, pure water, nutritious food, safe shelter, and healing knowledge. It provides the ethical framework for building health systems worthy of our interconnected world and our shared responsibility to future generations.
