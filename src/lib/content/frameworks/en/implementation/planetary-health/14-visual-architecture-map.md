The Planetary Health Accord recognizes that complex health systems require clear, accessible, and culturally appropriate visualization to enable democratic participation and community understanding. This comprehensive visual architecture combines cutting-edge data visualization with traditional knowledge representation, ensuring that system complexity serves transparency rather than obscuring decision-making processes. All visualizations prioritize community accessibility, cultural competency, and the understanding that visual representation must respect diverse ways of seeing and understanding health systems.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Hans Rosling's Gapminder Foundation** demonstrated successful accessible data visualization for global health. Gapminder's animated bubble charts made complex health and development data accessible to general audiences, challenging misconceptions about global health progress. The foundation's "Dollar Street" project visualized global poverty and health by showing how families at different income levels live worldwide, making abstract statistics tangible and human. This approach shows how data visualization can democratize understanding of global health while maintaining human dignity and cultural sensitivity.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Andean Health Visualization Sovereignty Project** (2027-2032) successfully created the first traditional knowledge-integrated health dashboard. Quechua, Aymara, and other Andean communities collaborated to develop health visualizations using traditional textile patterns and mountain symbolism to represent health data. The dashboard showed both modern health metrics and traditional concepts like "sumak kawsay" (good living) using culturally appropriate colors and symbols. Youth knowledge keepers worked with data visualization experts to create interactive maps showing traditional healing routes and sacred site connections to community health, achieving 95% community comprehension while preserving cultural knowledge sovereignty.
