**Framework Position Within the Golden Triangle**: The borderless health rights framework operates as the practical application of Treaty Rights of Nature protections, Indigenous territorial sovereignty, and meta-governance coordination for cross-border health access. Operating through Global Enforcement Mechanism Health Division authority and Traditional Territory recognition, this framework demonstrates how Indigenous health sovereignty, Traditional Knowledge practitioner mobility, and coordinated global cooperation converge to ensure health access transcends colonial political borders while maintaining Traditional Territory authority and Indigenous healing system integrity through community sovereignty and Traditional Knowledge protection.

The Planetary Health Accord recognizes that health is a fundamental human right that transcends colonial political borders, immigration status, and national citizenship while respecting Indigenous territorial sovereignty and Traditional Knowledge systems. This comprehensive framework establishes mechanisms for ensuring that all people can access healthcare regardless of their location or displacement circumstances while prioritizing Indigenous Territory authority, Traditional healing practitioner mobility, and Traditional Knowledge sovereignty. All borderless health rights mechanisms prioritize Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Territory recognition, and the understanding that global health security requires protecting Traditional healing systems and Indigenous communities first.

**Revolutionary Health Rights Principles**: Indigenous Territory concepts demonstrate that effective health access emerges from Traditional Territory sovereignty, bioregional health governance, and Traditional healing practitioner networks that transcend colonial political boundaries while maintaining cultural protocol compliance and Traditional Knowledge sovereignty. This framework operationalizes Traditional Territory authority as the foundation for cross-border health access while using Treaty enforcement mechanisms to protect Indigenous health sovereignty and Traditional healing mobility.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Inuit Circumpolar Council Health Cooperation** demonstrates successful Indigenous cross-border health coordination. The ICC coordinates health initiatives across Alaska, Canada, Greenland, and Russia, maintaining Inuit cultural identity and Traditional Knowledge while addressing shared health challenges. Traditional healers practice across political borders, Traditional medicines are shared between communities, and Traditional Knowledge guides health policy development while respecting Indigenous sovereignty and cultural protocols in each nation.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Great Lakes Indigenous Health Territory Network** (2027-2032) successfully established Indigenous cross-border health sovereignty across the Great Lakes bioregion spanning Canada and the United States. Traditional Territory health governance operated independently of colonial borders, with Traditional healers practicing freely across the region and Traditional medicine ecosystems protected through Treaty Rights of Nature enforcement. Indigenous communities controlled Global Health Security Fund allocation for Traditional Territory health while maintaining Traditional Knowledge sovereignty and cultural protocol compliance. The network achieved universal health access for Indigenous communities while strengthening Traditional governance and preserving Traditional Knowledge systems across colonial political boundaries.
