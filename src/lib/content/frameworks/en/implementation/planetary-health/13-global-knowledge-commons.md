The Planetary Health Accord recognizes that health knowledge belongs to all humanity and must be freely accessible while respecting cultural sovereignty and traditional knowledge systems. This comprehensive framework creates a global health knowledge commons that democratizes access to medical research, preserves traditional healing wisdom, and ensures that knowledge serves community empowerment rather than corporate profit. All knowledge commons mechanisms prioritize community consent, cultural competency, and the understanding that diverse ways of knowing strengthen global health wisdom.

**Case Study (Real)**: **PubMed Central and Open Access Movement** demonstrates successful open science implementation. Since 2000, PubMed Central has provided free access to biomedical research, with NIH mandating open access for publicly funded research since 2008. The initiative has democratized access to medical knowledge, enabling researchers in low-resource settings to access cutting-edge research. However, it has largely excluded traditional knowledge systems, highlighting the need for more inclusive approaches that recognize indigenous healing wisdom alongside conventional biomedical research.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Global Indigenous Health Knowledge Network** (2026-2031) successfully created the world's first community-controlled traditional knowledge commons. Over 500 indigenous communities participated in documenting traditional healing practices while maintaining full sovereignty over their knowledge. AI translation systems were trained to preserve cultural context and metaphors, making traditional knowledge accessible across linguistic barriers while preventing biopiracy. Youth knowledge keepers became global advocates for knowledge sovereignty, creating protocols that were adopted by major universities and pharmaceutical companies for ethical traditional knowledge research.
