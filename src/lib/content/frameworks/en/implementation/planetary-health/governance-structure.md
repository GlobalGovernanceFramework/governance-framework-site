**Framework Position Within the Golden Triangle**: The governance structure serves as the institutional bridge between Treaty enforcement mechanisms, Indigenous sovereignty systems, and meta-governance coordination architecture. Operating through the Planetary Health Meta-Council as the primary coordination mechanism, this structure implements subsidiarity principles that ensure Indigenous communities maintain authority over Traditional Territory health governance while enabling coordinated global response to planetary health crises. The Global Health Security Fund (funded by Treaty carbon taxes and financial transaction taxes) provides sustainable financing for Indigenous-led health governance with Traditional Knowledge sovereignty protection.

The Planetary Health Accord establishes a revolutionary governance system designed to ensure Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Knowledge protection, and community self-determination while enabling coordinated global action on planetary health challenges. This comprehensive framework balances the need for coordinated planetary response with respect for Indigenous autonomy, Traditional governance systems, and bioregional sovereignty. The governance framework prioritizes meaningful inclusion of Indigenous communities, Traditional Knowledge holders, and frontline health workers while maintaining the coordination capabilities needed for rapid crisis response through meta-governance architecture.

**Revolutionary Governance Principles**: Indigenous governance systems demonstrate that effective health coordination emerges from Traditional consensus methods, Elder wisdom, and seven-generation thinking rather than top-down institutional control. This governance structure operationalizes these principles through subsidiarity implementation that prioritizes Indigenous authority while enabling global coordination through Traditional Knowledge-guided cooperation.

**Case Study (Real)**: **New Zealand's Māori Health Authority** demonstrates successful Indigenous health governance integration. Established in 2022, Te Aka Whai Ora (Māori Health Authority) exercises authority over Māori health strategies and funding with Treaty of Waitangi-based co-governance. The Authority integrates traditional Māori health concepts like hauora (holistic well-being) with modern health systems while maintaining Māori authority over cultural health practices and ensuring culturally appropriate service delivery for Māori communities.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Circumpolar Indigenous Health Sovereignty Council** (2027-2032) successfully established Indigenous health governance across Arctic regions including Alaska, northern Canada, Greenland, and northern Scandinavia. Inuit, Sami, and other Arctic Indigenous communities gained primary authority over health governance in Traditional Territories, with Traditional healers working alongside Community Health Legions using Two-Eyed Seeing approaches. The Council integrated Traditional environmental knowledge with modern surveillance for climate health early warning while maintaining Indigenous authority over Traditional Knowledge and ensuring cultural safety protocols. Traditional consensus methods enhanced by meta-governance digital tools enabled coordinated Arctic health governance while preserving Indigenous sovereignty and cultural protocols.
