You're absolutely right! That's much more strategic and thorough. Let me analyze the existing Planetary Health Framework files to identify which ones need revision and how extensively.Based on my analysis of the existing Planetary Health Framework documents, here's my strategic assessment of which files need revision and to what extent:

## File-by-File Revision Analysis

### **ðŸ”´ HIGH PRIORITY - MAJOR REVISION NEEDED**

1. **`index.md`** - Framework Introduction
   - **Current State**: No Golden Triangle positioning
   - **Required Changes**: Complete rewrite to position within ecosystem, explain relationship to Treaty/Indigenous/Meta-governance
   - **Integration Depth**: 80-90% content revision

2. **`manifesto.md`** - Framework Vision  
   - **Current State**: Generic planetary health approach
   - **Required Changes**: Reframe vision within Golden Triangle, center Indigenous sovereignty, integrate Treaty mechanisms
   - **Integration Depth**: 70-80% content revision

3. **`community-centered-healthcare.md`** - Core Service Delivery
   - **Current State**: Community Health Legions without Indigenous integration
   - **Required Changes**: Add Traditional Healing Systems chapter, integrate TEK, establish Planetary Health Meta-Council
   - **Integration Depth**: 60-70% content revision

### **ðŸŸ¡ MEDIUM PRIORITY - MODERATE REVISION NEEDED**

4. **`financing-mechanisms.md`** - Resource Systems
   - **Current State**: Global Health Solidarity Fund without Treaty integration
   - **Required Changes**: Link to Treaty carbon taxes, establish Global Health Security Fund, integrate Indigenous governance
   - **Integration Depth**: 40-50% content revision

5. **`governance-structure.md`** - Authority Systems
   - **Current State**: Global Health Equity Council without meta-governance coordination
   - **Required Changes**: Establish Planetary Health Meta-Council, integrate subsidiarity principles, add Indigenous veto authority
   - **Integration Depth**: 45-55% content revision

6. **`pandemic-climate-preparedness.md`** - Crisis Response
   - **Current State**: One Health surveillance without Indigenous early warning
   - **Required Changes**: Integrate Traditional Ecological Knowledge, add Global Enforcement Mechanism Health Division
   - **Integration Depth**: 35-45% content revision

### **ðŸŸ¢ LOW PRIORITY - MINOR REVISION NEEDED**

7. **`medical-innovation-access.md`** - Innovation Systems
   - **Current State**: Open-source medicines approach generally aligned
   - **Required Changes**: Add Traditional Knowledge protection, ensure Treaty enforcement integration
   - **Integration Depth**: 20-30% content revision

8. **`transparency-anti-corruption.md`** - Accountability Systems  
   - **Current State**: Corruption watchdog without Treaty enforcement
   - **Required Changes**: Link to Global Enforcement Mechanism, add Indigenous accountability methods
   - **Integration Depth**: 25-35% content revision

### **ðŸ”µ MINIMAL REVISION - LIGHT INTEGRATION NEEDED**

9. **`technology-data-infrastructure.md`** - Technology Systems
   - **Current State**: AI and blockchain without Indigenous data sovereignty
   - **Required Changes**: Add Indigenous data sovereignty protocols, community technology control
   - **Integration Depth**: 15-25% content revision

10. **`borderless-health-rights.md`** - Rights Framework
    - **Current State**: Migrant health rights approach mostly compatible  
    - **Required Changes**: Ensure Indigenous territory recognition, add Traditional Knowledge mobility
    - **Integration Depth**: 10-20% content revision

### **ðŸ“‹ STRUCTURAL FILES - UPDATE ONLY**

11. **`conclusion.md`** - Framework Summary
    - **Required Changes**: Update to reflect Golden Triangle integration, emphasize Indigenous leadership
    - **Integration Depth**: 30-40% content revision

12. **`executive-summary.md`** - Overview Document
    - **Required Changes**: Completely rewrite to reflect integrated approach within Golden Triangle
    - **Integration Depth**: 80-90% content revision

## **Recommended Revision Strategy**

### **Phase 1: Foundation Files (Week 1)**
- Start with `index.md` and `manifesto.md` to establish new framework positioning
- Complete `community-centered-healthcare.md` with Traditional Healing Systems chapter
- This creates the conceptual foundation for all other integrations

### **Phase 2: Core Mechanisms (Week 2)**  
- Revise `financing-mechanisms.md` and `governance-structure.md` 
- Update `pandemic-climate-preparedness.md` with Indigenous early warning integration
- These establish the operational mechanisms within Golden Triangle

### **Phase 3: Supporting Systems (Week 3)**
- Light revisions to remaining files to ensure consistency
- Complete `executive-summary.md` and `conclusion.md` to reflect integrated framework
- Final coherence check across all documents

This approach ensures we build the integration systematically, starting with the most critical conceptual foundations and moving through operational mechanisms to supporting systems. Would you like me to proceed with this strategy, starting with the high-priority revisions?
