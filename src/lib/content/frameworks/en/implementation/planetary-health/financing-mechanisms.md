**Framework Position Within the Golden Triangle**: The financing mechanisms serve as the economic foundation that enables Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Knowledge preservation, and coordinated planetary health transformation. Operating through Treaty for Our Only Home funding streams ($45-60B annually from carbon taxes and financial transaction taxes), these mechanisms flow resources to Indigenous-led health initiatives while maintaining community control and Traditional Knowledge sovereignty. The Planetary Health Meta-Council coordinates resource allocation using subsidiarity principles that prioritize Indigenous authority and bioregional governance.

The Planetary Health Accord requires transformative financing mechanisms that prioritize Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional Knowledge preservation, and community self-determination over profit extraction. This comprehensive financing framework combines Treaty-generated revenue streams with equitable distribution mechanisms, creating a global health economy that serves planetary and community well-being through Indigenous leadership and Traditional Ecological Knowledge guidance. All financing mechanisms include robust accountability measures prioritizing Indigenous communities, Traditional Knowledge compensation, and frontline health workers under community control.

**Revolutionary Economic Principles**: Indigenous knowledge systems demonstrate that true wealth flows from healthy relationships between communities and ecosystems, measured through Traditional wellness indicators rather than GDP-focused metrics. The financing framework operationalizes this understanding by prioritizing Gross Planetary Health Index outcomes and Traditional Knowledge-guided resource allocation over pure economic growth.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend** demonstrates successful resource sharing based on commons principles. Since 1982, Alaska has distributed annual dividends to all residents from oil revenue, providing universal basic income that recognizes shared ownership of natural resources. The dividend has reduced poverty and provided economic security while maintaining broad political support across party lines. This model demonstrates how resource extraction can benefit communities when commons principles guide distribution.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Andean Traditional Knowledge Economic Sovereignty Initiative** (2027-2032) successfully established Indigenous-controlled health financing across 200 communities in Peru, Bolivia, and Ecuador. Traditional resource sharing methods guided Global Health Security Fund allocation, while Indigenous communities received compensation for Traditional Knowledge through community-controlled benefit-sharing agreements. Traditional healers developed cooperative enterprises for Traditional medicine production, achieving economic sovereignty while preserving Traditional Knowledge and strengthening cultural identity. The initiative demonstrated how Indigenous economic systems could provide sustainable health financing while maintaining Traditional governance and cultural protocols.
