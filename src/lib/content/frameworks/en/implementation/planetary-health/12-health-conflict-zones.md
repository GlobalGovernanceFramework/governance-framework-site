The Planetary Health Accord recognizes that armed conflict and civil unrest create unique health challenges requiring specialized approaches that respect human dignity, cultural sovereignty, and international humanitarian law. This comprehensive framework ensures that health services remain accessible during conflicts while supporting community resilience, traditional healing practices, and post-conflict recovery. All conflict zone health interventions prioritize neutrality, community consent, and the understanding that healing must address both immediate medical needs and long-term community trauma.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Afghanistan Operations** demonstrate successful conflict zone health delivery with community engagement. Despite ongoing conflict, MSF operates trauma centers, maternity hospitals, and mobile clinics by maintaining strict neutrality and building trust with all parties. Their **Community Health Worker program** trains local residents including women in conservative areas, respecting cultural values while providing essential care. The integration of traditional birth attendants with modern obstetric care has reduced maternal mortality while maintaining cultural acceptability and community ownership.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Syrian Community Health Resilience Network** (2019-2024) successfully maintained health services during ongoing conflict through underground clinics and traditional healing integration. Community health assemblies governed health service delivery using traditional consensus methods, while encrypted blockchain systems tracked medical supplies and patient records. Traditional healers worked alongside medical doctors in protected underground facilities, providing holistic care that addressed both physical trauma and spiritual healing. Youth health advocates used mesh networks to coordinate care across besieged areas, maintaining community connections and traditional knowledge transmission even during the most intense fighting.
