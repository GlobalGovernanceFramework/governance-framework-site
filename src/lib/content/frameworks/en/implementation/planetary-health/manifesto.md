**Estimated Reading Time**: 4 minutes

The Planetary Health Accord stands as humanity's bold declaration that health is not merely the absence of disease, but the flourishing of all life on Earth through the sacred relationships between human communities, non-human beings, and the living planet that sustains us all. **Rooted in the wisdom of Indigenous Peoples who have maintained these relationships for millennia**, we recognize that our individual health is inseparable from the health of our communities, our ecosystems, and the sovereignty of those who have always known how to live in balance with the Earth.

In this time of cascading planetary crises—where pandemics emerge from the destruction of wild spaces, where climate change drives both ecological collapse and profound health inequities, where colonial health systems extract wealth while communities suffer—we call for nothing less than the complete transformation of how humanity understands and practices health. **This Accord emerges from within the Golden Triangle ecosystem, where Treaty institutions provide the legal and political framework, Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge systems offer the foundational wisdom, and meta-governance coordination creates the pathways for unprecedented cooperation across all domains of human activity.**

## <a id="our-sacred-purpose"></a>Our Sacred Purpose

We exist to restore the fundamental understanding that health is a sacred relationship—between body and spirit, between community and land, between present and future generations, between human and more-than-human worlds. The Planetary Health Accord recognizes that:

- **Indigenous sovereignty is the foundation of planetary health**: The health of the planet is intrinsically tied to the wellbeing of Indigenous Peoples. When Indigenous Peoples have their Land, culture, and sovereignty, they are more likely to have greater wellbeing and will continue to sustainably care for more than a third of the world's old-growth forests and the most biodiverse regions on the planet

- **Traditional Ecological Knowledge guides all healing**: Indigenous knowledge represents a holistic and longitudinal approach to health that integrates ecological, social, empirical, and spiritual knowledge, evolved from long-term interactions Indigenous people have with their local environments

- **Health transcends colonial borders**: Viruses, environmental toxins, and climate impacts ignore political boundaries, while colonial health systems create artificial separations between human, animal, and environmental health that Traditional Knowledge has always understood as interconnected

- **Community sovereignty transforms systems**: Traditional Indigenous health care practices increase individual-level self-determination over health care and improve health outcomes, with participants noting better appropriation of health care choices and improved access to both Western and traditional care

- **Technology must serve Indigenous wisdom**: Digital innovations in health must enhance rather than replace Traditional Ecological Knowledge, with Indigenous data sovereignty ensuring communities control their information and healing relationships

- **Economic systems must prioritize regeneration**: The current extractive economy that treats health as commodity and Earth as resource must be transformed into regenerative systems that measure success through the Gross Planetary Health Index—combining Traditional wellness, ecological integrity, and community resilience

**Core Principle**: To ensure health sovereignty for all beings within planetary boundaries, recognizing that true health emerges from the sacred relationships maintained by Indigenous Peoples and must be protected through Treaty institutions, Indigenous governance, and coordinated global cooperation.

## <a id="our-community-relations"></a>Our Community and Relations

This Accord speaks to all beings in our interconnected web of life—humans, animals, plants, waters, lands, and future generations—united in our shared responsibility to maintain the sacred relationships that sustain health across all domains of existence.

### We Honor Our Indigenous Teachers and Knowledge Keepers
- **Lead the transformation** of planetary health from colonial extraction to regenerative Traditional Ecological Knowledge
- **Exercise full sovereignty** over Traditional healing systems, sacred sites, and medicinal plant ecosystems through Treaty Rights of Nature protections
- **Control all research and data** affecting Indigenous communities through comprehensive data sovereignty protocols and Free, Prior, and Informed Consent requirements
- **Receive just compensation** for Traditional Knowledge contributions through Global Health Security Fund benefit-sharing and intellectual property protection

### We Call Upon Treaty Institutions to Serve Indigenous Sovereignty
- **Fund health transformation** through the Global Health Security Fund capitalized by carbon taxes and financial transaction taxes with community-controlled allocation prioritizing Indigenous-led initiatives
- **Enforce Traditional Knowledge protection** through the Global Enforcement Mechanism Health Division with authority to prosecute biopiracy and pharmaceutical exploitation
- **Recognize Rights of Nature** for traditional medicine ecosystems, sacred healing sites, and bioregional health governance systems
- **Enable Indigenous health jurisdiction** across political borders for Traditional healers, ceremony, and medicinal plant access

### We Call Upon Communities to Reclaim Health Sovereignty
- **Participate in Community Health Legions** trained in Two-Eyed Seeing approaches that honor both Traditional Knowledge and beneficial modern practices
- **Establish bioregional health governance** through Community Health Assemblies using Traditional consensus methods enhanced by modern democratic tools
- **Implement Gross Planetary Health Index** as alternative to GDP, measuring Traditional wellness, ecological integrity, and community resilience over disease-focused metrics
- **Build mutual aid networks** that combine Traditional reciprocity with modern resource sharing for comprehensive community care

### We Call Upon Modern Health Workers to Serve Traditional Wisdom
- **Learn from Traditional healers** with cultural humility, recognizing Indigenous knowledge systems as primary teachers of holistic health
- **Practice cultural safety** in all health interventions, ensuring Traditional Knowledge receives equal standing with scientific expertise in healing relationships
- **Support Indigenous health sovereignty** by advocating for Traditional Knowledge protection and community control over health research and intervention design
- **Integrate Two-Eyed Seeing approaches** that combine beneficial modern techniques with Traditional healing wisdom under Indigenous leadership and cultural protocols

### We Call Upon Global Institutions to Enable Coordination
- **Support Planetary Health Meta-Council** coordination that institutionalizes cooperation between traditional healers, Community Health Legions, and ecosystem guardians
- **Implement subsidiarity principles** ensuring health solutions prioritize community-led approaches with Traditional practices recognized as foundational to health sovereignty
- **Deploy cognitive immunity protocols** using Indigenous storytelling and community validation to counter health misinformation while protecting diverse ways of knowing
- **Fund crisis response networks** linking Indigenous early warning systems with modern surveillance through 24-hour coordination capabilities

## <a id="our-call-liberation"></a>Our Call to Liberation

**The time for reforms within colonial systems has passed.** Climate change accelerates ecosystem collapse, pandemics emerge from habitat destruction, and health inequities compound daily while colonial health systems extract wealth from the communities most in need of healing. We demand transformative action aligned with the urgency of our planetary health crisis and the wisdom of those who have always known how to live in right relationship with the Earth.

### Immediate Decolonizing Actions (0-12 months):
- **Indigenous partnership protocols**: Establish Free, Prior, and Informed Consent standards for all health interventions affecting Indigenous communities, with Traditional Knowledge holders leading partnership design
- **Traditional healing recognition**: Begin formal integration of Traditional healers into Community Health Legions with equal standing, cultural protocol respect, and compensation for Indigenous knowledge contributions
- **Community health sovereignty**: Form Community Health Assemblies using Traditional consensus methods to govern local health priorities and resource allocation
- **Sacred site protection**: Implement Treaty Rights of Nature protections for traditional medicine ecosystems and sacred healing sites with Indigenous communities exercising full jurisdiction

### Systemic Transformation (1-5 years):
- **Global Health Security Fund deployment**: Launch sustainable financing through Treaty carbon taxes with 60% community-controlled allocation prioritizing Indigenous-led pandemic preparedness
- **Planetary Health Meta-Council operation**: Establish coordination mechanism institutionalizing cooperation between traditional healers, Community Health Legions, and ecosystem guardians in 50 bioregions
- **Indigenous data sovereignty**: Implement comprehensive community control over all health information collection, analysis, and distribution affecting Indigenous populations
- **Gross Planetary Health Index adoption**: Replace GDP-focused health metrics with Traditional wellness indicators, ecological health measures, and community resilience assessments in 25+ nations

### Liberation Outcomes (5-15 years):
- **Universal Traditional-modern healing integration**: Achieve health coverage combining Indigenous healing wisdom with beneficial modern practices under Traditional Knowledge leadership globally
- **Bioregional health governance**: Establish Indigenous territorial health jurisdiction with Traditional healers exercising full autonomy while collaborating with Community Health Legions
- **Ecosystem health legal standing**: Secure Rights of Nature protections for all traditional medicine ecosystems with Global Enforcement Mechanism authority preventing exploitation
- **Regenerative health civilization**: Create health systems that heal communities and ecosystems simultaneously while maintaining Traditional Knowledge sovereignty and community self-determination

## <a id="our-vision-regeneration"></a>Our Vision of Regeneration

We envision a world where:

**Every Traditional healer** practices with full sovereignty and cultural protocol protection, their knowledge systems recognized as foundational to planetary health, supported by Treaty enforcement mechanisms that prevent biopiracy and ensure just compensation for Traditional Knowledge contributions.

**Every community** exercises health sovereignty through bioregional governance, with Community Health Assemblies using Traditional consensus methods to determine health priorities, resource allocation, and healing relationships that serve both individual and ecosystem well-being.

**Every health system** integrates Traditional Ecological Knowledge as primary guidance, with Two-Eyed Seeing approaches ensuring beneficial modern techniques serve Traditional wisdom rather than displacing Indigenous knowledge systems.

**Every crisis response** coordinates Indigenous early warning systems with modern surveillance, preventing the policy incoherence that characterized COVID-19 by honoring Traditional Knowledge of environmental health connections and community-controlled emergency protocols.

**Every innovation** emerges from Traditional Knowledge leadership, with Indigenous data sovereignty ensuring communities control health research, technology development, and information systems affecting their populations.

**Every success** measures Traditional wellness, ecological integrity, and community resilience through the Gross Planetary Health Index, moving beyond colonial disease-focused metrics to holistic indicators that reflect the sacred relationships sustaining all life.

**Every decision** honors seven-generation thinking, with Traditional Knowledge of intergenerational responsibility guiding health choices that serve not only present communities but future generations and the more-than-human world.

This is not utopian dreaming—it is the restoration of relationships that Indigenous Peoples have maintained for millennia, now supported by Treaty institutions that provide legal protection, enforcement mechanisms that prevent exploitation, and coordination systems that enable unprecedented global cooperation while maintaining Traditional Knowledge sovereignty.

**The tools exist.** The Global Health Security Fund provides sustainable financing. The Global Enforcement Mechanism protects Traditional Knowledge. The Planetary Health Meta-Council enables coordination. Rights of Nature frameworks protect sacred sites. Indigenous data sovereignty protocols ensure community control.

**The wisdom is here.** Indigenous Peoples' sovereignty over their territories enables them to sustainably care for ecosystems, and their wellbeing is directly connected to planetary health through Traditional Ecological Knowledge that recognizes health as emerging from right relationships with all life

**The urgency is now.** Climate change is affecting the very foundations of our well-being: the air we breathe, the water we drink, the quality and quantity of food we produce, our exposure to infectious diseases, and even the habitability of our communities

What we need now is the collective will to center Indigenous sovereignty, implement Treaty mechanisms, and coordinate global cooperation in service of the sacred relationships that sustain all life on our only home.

**Join us.** The Planetary Health Accord begins with each of us choosing to honor Indigenous wisdom, support Traditional Knowledge sovereignty, and work within Treaty institutions and coordination mechanisms that serve life rather than extraction. Together, we can restore the sacred relationships between human communities, non-human beings, and the living Earth.

**The transformation is Indigenous-led. The future is regenerative. The healing begins with our relationships.**
