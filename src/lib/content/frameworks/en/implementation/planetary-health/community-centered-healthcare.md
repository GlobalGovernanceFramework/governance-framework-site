**Framework Position Within the Golden Triangle**: This healthcare delivery framework operates as the practical implementation bridge between the Treaty's institutional mechanisms, Indigenous wisdom systems, and meta-governance coordination. It demonstrates how the Global Health Security Fund (funded by Treaty carbon taxes and financial transaction taxes) enables Traditional Ecological Knowledge-led health systems, coordinated through the Planetary Health Meta-Council using subsidiarity principles that prioritize Indigenous sovereignty and community self-determination.

The Planetary Health Accord fundamentally reimagines healthcare delivery as Indigenous-led, bioregionally governed, and ecosystem-integrated service that addresses health's spiritual, environmental, and social dimensions through Traditional Ecological Knowledge. This comprehensive approach transcends disease treatment to embrace community healing, emphasizing Traditional healing systems, sovereignty protection, and meta-governance coordination. All healthcare delivery prioritizes Indigenous authority, cultural safety, and the understanding that individual health cannot be separated from community, ecosystem, and seven-generation well-being.

**Revolutionary Health Definition**: Indigenous knowledge encompasses a holistic view of nature and people more akin to planetary health than healthcare systems based on people alone. Traditional Indigenous health care practices increase individual-level self-determination over health care and improve health outcomes, with participants noting better appropriation of health care choices and improved access to both Western and traditional care.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Māori Health Initiatives in New Zealand** demonstrate successful Traditional healing integration. The **Whānau Ora approach** integrates traditional Māori concepts of family well-being with modern health services through Māori health providers and Traditional healing practitioners. Māori health models emphasize spiritual, mental, emotional, and physical well-being while maintaining cultural protocols and Traditional Knowledge authority. This integrated approach has improved health outcomes while strengthening Māori cultural identity and Traditional healing practice preservation.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Pacific Islands Traditional-Modern Health Integration Network** (2026-2030) successfully integrated Traditional Pacific healing systems with Community Health Legions across 15 island nations. Traditional healers worked alongside Community Health Legions using Two-Eyed Seeing approaches, combining Traditional knowledge of ocean-based healing with modern medical care while maintaining full cultural sovereignty over Traditional Knowledge. Youth health advocates trained in both Traditional knowledge and modern skills became regional leaders, creating innovations like Traditional navigation-based health systems and community-controlled Traditional medicine preservation programs. The network achieved universal health coverage while strengthening Traditional cultures and preparing for climate change impacts through Traditional adaptation knowledge.
