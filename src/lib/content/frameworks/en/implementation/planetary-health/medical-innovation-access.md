The Planetary Health Accord transforms medical innovation from a profit-driven, patent-protected system to a collaborative global commons that prioritizes human need over corporate profit. This comprehensive approach combines open-source research, community-controlled innovation, and equitable access mechanisms to ensure that medical breakthroughs benefit all humanity, especially marginalized communities who have historically been excluded from both innovation processes and access to life-saving treatments.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Brazil's Generic Medicine Success** demonstrates effective pharmaceutical access policy. Brazil's generic medicine program, launched in 1999, increased generic medicine market share from 8% to 35% by 2019, reducing medicine costs by up to 70%. The program included technology transfer requirements for multinational pharmaceutical companies and investment in local manufacturing capacity. Brazil's **Farmanguinhos laboratory** produces essential medicines for the public health system, ensuring access to HIV/AIDS treatments and other essential medicines while building local technical capacity.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **West African Pharmaceutical Commons Initiative** (2027-2030) successfully established open-source medicine production across 15 countries. Traditional healers collaborated with university researchers to develop standardized herbal medicine preparations, while 3D-printing labs in rural areas produced essential medicines locally. Community health assemblies determined medicine priorities, leading to 80% reduction in medicine costs and 90% improvement in essential medicine availability. Traditional knowledge holders received 15% of revenue from commercialized natural products, funding community health programs and medicinal plant conservation.
