The Planetary Health Accord recognizes that corruption in healthcare systems diverts resources from the most vulnerable populations and undermines community trust in health services. This comprehensive transparency framework combines cutting-edge technology with community-controlled oversight to ensure that health resources serve healing rather than private enrichment. All anti-corruption mechanisms prioritize community sovereignty, democratic accountability, and protection for those who speak truth to power about healthcare system failures.

**Case Study (Real)**: **Ukraine's ProZorro Procurement System** demonstrates successful transparent public procurement innovation. Launched in 2016, ProZorro makes all government procurement data publicly available in real-time, including healthcare purchases. The system has saved over $6 billion in public funds by increasing competition and reducing corruption. Civil society organizations monitor procurement through the platform, and community feedback helps identify irregularities. During the COVID-19 pandemic, ProZorro enabled transparent tracking of medical equipment purchases, building public trust and ensuring efficient resource allocation.

**Case Study (Fictive)**: The **Andean Health Transparency Alliance** (2027-2031) successfully integrated traditional accountability methods with modern anti-corruption technology across 6 countries. Indigenous accountability circles (círculos de rendición de cuentas) worked alongside AI fraud detection systems, combining elder wisdom about resource sharing with algorithmic pattern recognition. Community health assemblies controlled all transparency oversight, while traditional healers monitored respect for indigenous knowledge in pharmaceutical procurement. Youth transparency advocates trained in both traditional accountability ceremonies and modern audit techniques achieved 95% reduction in healthcare corruption while strengthening cultural identity and community control.
