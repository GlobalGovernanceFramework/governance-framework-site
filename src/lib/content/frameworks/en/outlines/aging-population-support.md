# Global Governance Framework for Aging Population Support

## Executive Summary
**Vision**: Transform aging from a societal burden into a cornerstone of thriving communities through dignity, purpose, and intergenerational connection, WITH elders as primary architects of their own support systems.

**Core Innovation**: Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) that rewards elder contributions + meaningful occupation rights + nested support systems + regenerative economics that strengthen through elder participation.

**2040 Commitment**: Every elder lives with economic security, social purpose, respected voice, and agency over their own aging journey.

**Key Metrics**: 80% elder economic inclusion, 70% reduction in age discrimination, 90% healthcare access, 50% reduction in elder isolation, 60% elder political participation by 2035.

## Preamble: Aging as Asset, Agency, and Wisdom
The global aging population represents humanity's greatest untapped resource - a reservoir of wisdom, experience, and potential waiting to be activated BY elders themselves. This framework envisions aging not as decline, but as a vibrant life stage where continued contribution meets earned security, where elders lead their own transformation. **By 2040, all nations commit to ensuring every elder lives with security, purpose, respect, and full agency over their aging experience.**
