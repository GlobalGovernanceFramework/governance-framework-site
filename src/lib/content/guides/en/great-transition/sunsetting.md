### Part I: Acknowledging the Past, Sunsetting the Present

#### Sunsetting the Legacy System (Applying the Hearthstone Protocol)

The first step in any transition is the most difficult: beginning the end of what has defined a community for decades. This process is not about destruction but about a dignified and orderly transfer of responsibility. It involves taking control of the physical assets of the legacy industry—the mines, the factories, the land—and placing them in the hands of the community to manage for a new, regenerative purpose. The GGF provides a specialized legal and economic framework for precisely this task: The Hearthstone Protocol.

* **Initiating the Transition:** The journey begins when a community decides to proactively shape its future, or when an extractive industry signals its intent to downsize or depart. The **Hearthstone Protocol** provides the official pathways for communities to engage these industries not as adversaries, but as partners in a managed transition. It replaces the typical scenario of sudden closures and asset abandonment with a structured process for transferring ownership to the people who have the deepest stake in the region's future.

* **The Stewardship Trust:** The legal heart of the transition is the creation of a multi-stakeholder Stewardship Trust. This new entity takes legal ownership of the legacy assets, ensuring they cannot be sold to other extractive operators and are instead managed for the community's long-term well-being. The formation follows a clear, step-by-step process:
    1.  **Convene Stakeholders:** The BAZ council or a provisional community body brings all affected parties to the table—worker unions, Indigenous representatives, local government, ecological experts, and community leaders.
    2.  **Define a Regenerative Purpose:** The Trust’s charter is collectively defined. Is the primary goal ecological restoration? The creation of new green infrastructure? A combination of both? This purpose becomes the legally binding mandate for the Trust’s governors.
    3.  **Establish Governance:** A board is formed with equitable representation from all stakeholder groups, ensuring that former workers and community members have a decisive voice in the future of the assets they once served.
    4.  **Formalize the Transfer:** Using the legal tools within the Hearthstone Protocol, the Trust formally assumes ownership of the deeds to the land, factories, and infrastructure.

* **Funding the Transition:** A transition requires capital. The Hearthstone Protocol establishes two primary mechanisms to finance the transfer and the initial restoration work:
    * **The Extractive Industry Transition Tax:** A levy applied to the divesting industry’s final years of operation or profits, ensuring that a portion of the wealth generated from the region is reinvested in its healing and rebirth.
    * **Commons Conversion Bonds:** To raise immediate upfront capital, the newly formed Stewardship Trust can issue these bonds, which are used to finance the safe decommissioning of old infrastructure and large-scale ecological restoration. These are investments in a region’s recovery, with returns generated from the new regenerative economy that emerges.

* **Case Study Snippet:** A community in Germany's Ruhr Valley, facing the closure of its last major steel manufacturing plant, uses this process. They engage the corporation through the **Hearthstone Protocol** and form the "Ruhr Future Stewardship Trust" to take ownership of the plant and its surrounding lands. The transfer is financed by a final levy on the steel company's asset sale and the successful issuance of "Ruhr Restoration Bonds" to regional investors, providing the capital needed to begin the "Steel-to-Solar" transition project.
