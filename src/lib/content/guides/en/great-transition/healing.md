#### Healing the Wounds (Using the Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework)

A systemic transition is not complete once the assets and finances are settled. Extractive industries leave behind deep wounds that are not measured on a balance sheet—they are carried in the bodies of the workers, etched into the landscape, and felt in the social fabric of the community. The GGF recognizes that true justice requires a formal process of healing and accountability for these historical harms. This is not about assigning blame, but about creating a shared truth from which the community can build its new future.

* **Beyond Economic Harm:** The closure of a mine or factory leaves more than unemployment; it leaves a legacy of social, cultural, and ecological wounds. These include public health crises from pollution, the contamination of rivers and soil, the loss of community identity, and the disruption of cultural practices. A just transition must create space to acknowledge this full spectrum of harm before genuine regeneration can begin.

* **Launching a Truth and Reconciliation Process:** The GGF provides a dedicated methodology for this work within the **Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework**. The framework guides the community in launching a formal Truth and Reconciliation Process (`process_trc`), a critical step for acknowledging the past. This involves:
    1.  **Establishing a Mandate:** The new Stewardship Trust, in partnership with the BAZ council and community leaders, formally convenes the process.
    2.  **Bearing Witness:** A safe, public forum is created where community members can give testimony. Former industrial workers can speak about health conditions, families can share stories of environmental impact, and elders can describe the changes to the land they have witnessed.
    3.  **Creating a Public Record:** The testimony is documented, creating an official, shared history of the industry's full impact. This act of formal acknowledgment is a powerful tool for community healing.

* **Restorative Justice in Action:** The findings of the Truth and Reconciliation Process are more than a historical document; they are the foundation for legally binding restorative actions. The recommendations from the commission—such as funding for community health centers or the restoration of a polluted waterway—are formalized through the **Justice Systems Framework**. Its tribunals serve as the venue to ratify these restorative plans, making them enforceable and ensuring the community has the legal and financial resources to see them through.

* **Case Study Snippet:** Following the asset transfer, the Ruhr Valley's "Future Stewardship Trust" convenes a Truth and Reconciliation Commission. For months, former steelworkers testify about respiratory illnesses, while residents provide evidence of the local river's degradation. This testimony, once publicly acknowledged, leads directly to the creation of a formal, legally-binding Community Healing and Restoration Plan, which is funded by the transition bonds and ratified by the regional justice tribunal.
