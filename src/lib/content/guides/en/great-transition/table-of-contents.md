    * **Initiating the Transition:** How communities can use the **Hearthstone Protocol** to engage with legacy industries seeking to divest or downsize.
    * **The Stewardship Trust:** A step-by-step guide to forming a multi-stakeholder Stewardship Trust to take ownership of legacy assets (mines, factories, land) and manage them for a regenerative purpose.
    * **Funding the Transition:** How the **Extractive Industry Transition Tax** and **Commons Conversion Bonds** are used to finance the asset transfer and create the initial budget for restoration and community support.
    * **Case Study Snippet:** How a community in the Ruhr Valley, Germany, uses this process to take control of a former steel manufacturing plant.

* **Healing the Wounds (Using the Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework)**
    * **Beyond Economic Harm:** Recognizing the deep social, cultural, and ecological wounds left by extractive industries.
    * **Launching a Truth and Reconciliation Process:** A guide to implementing the **Peace Framework's** `process_trc` to formally acknowledge historical harms to workers, communities, and the local ecosystem.
    * **Restorative Justice in Action:** How the findings from the reconciliation process can lead to legally binding restorative actions, adjudicated by the **Justice Systems Framework's** tribunals.
    * **Case Study Snippet:** The Ruhr Valley community holds a Truth and Reconciliation Commission where former steelworkers and residents give testimony about the health and environmental impacts of the plant, leading to a formal community healing and restoration plan.

**Part II: Building the Regenerative Future**

* **Empowering the Workforce (Implementing the Work in Liberation Framework)**
    * **From Worker to Steward:** The GGF's commitment to dignified, purposeful work.
    * **Creating a Just Transition Service Corps:** A practical guide to forming a branch of the **Community Work Teams** dedicated to the transition. This includes retraining former industrial workers for new roles.
    * **The New Work of Restoration:** Detailing the jobs created by the transition: ecological restoration, safe decommissioning of old infrastructure, building new renewable energy systems, and managing the new commons.
    * **Case Study Snippet:** The Ruhr Valley's former steelworkers are retrained and employed by the Just Transition Service Corps to begin the work of decontaminating the factory site and restoring the local river ecosystem.

* **Building the New Economy (Leveraging the AUBI Framework)**
    * **The Economic Safety Net:** How the **AUBI Framework's** universal baseline payment provides economic stability for every community member during the uncertainty of the transition.
    * **Rewarding the Work of Healing:** How the restoration and care work performed by the Just Transition Service Corps is rewarded with **Hearts** and **Leaves**, creating a new, regenerative income stream for the community.

    * **Case Study Snippet:** While the Ruhr Valley site is being restored, all residents receive their AUBI payment. The workers earn additional `Leaves` for the ecological restoration work. A new cooperative, funded by the GCF, starts building a solar farm on the cleaned-up site.

**Part III: Synthesis & Vision**

* **Case Study in Full - The Ruhr Valley's "Steel-to-Solar" Transition**
    * A complete, narrative walkthrough showing how the community uses all four frameworks over a ten-year period to transform their region from a declining industrial hub into a thriving, self-sufficient, and regenerative economy.

* **Conclusion - A Replicable Blueprint for Hope**
    * A summary of how the GGF's integrated approach provides a just, viable, and replicable pathway for any community seeking to move beyond an extractive past.
