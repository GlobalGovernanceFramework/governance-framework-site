#### **Detailed Table of Contents**

**Part I: Foundational Principles**

* **Chapter 1: The GGF's Core Principle: Stewardship over Extraction**
    * Defining "Right Relationship" with planetary resources.
    * The ethical hierarchy: Why human needs do not automatically override ecosystem agency.
    * The role of the **Moral Operating System (MOS)** in establishing the rights of ecosystems (`Tier 3`) that are subject to resource extraction.

**Part II: The Five Pillars of Regenerative Stewardship**

* **Chapter 2: The First Pillar - The Primacy of Indigenous Sovereignty**
    * The legal basis for BAZ authority over all resource stewardship within their territories.
    * A step-by-step walkthrough of the **FPIC 2.0** process for any proposed project.
    * Case Study: How a BAZ council uses its sovereign authority to co-design a small-scale, community-owned lithium extraction project that meets its own needs.

* **Chapter 3: The Second Pillar - The Circular Mandate**
    * How **The Phoenix Protocol** establishes a "Circular First" principle, mandating that projects must prove the non-viability of recycled/recovered materials before any new extraction is considered.
    * Protocols for "urban mining" and industrial waste reclamation.
    * Integrating circularity metrics into project approval via the **Biosphere Agency Index (BAI)**.

* **Chapter 4: The Third Pillar - The Transition to Commons**
    * Applying the **Hearthstone Protocol** to transition existing privately-owned mines and resource assets into community-governed **Stewardship Trusts**.
    * Utilizing the "Extractive Industry Transition Tax" to fund the cleanup of legacy sites and support affected communities.
    * Case Study: A former coal-mining region uses the Hearthstone Protocol to convert mining assets into a commons for geothermal energy and regenerative agriculture.

* **Chapter 5: The Fourth Pillar - The Legal Backstop**
    * Using the **Treaty for Our Only Home's** definition of **Ecocide** as the ultimate legal boundary for any resource project.
    * How Guardians, appointed under the **More-Than-Human Governance Framework**, can bring cases to the **Digital Justice Tribunal's "Rights of Nature" chamber** to halt destructive projects.
    * The role of **The Shield Protocol** in investigating and dismantling transnational criminal networks engaged in illegal mining and resource trafficking.

* **Chapter 6: The Fifth Pillar - Ethical Supply Chains**
    * How the **Gaian Trade Framework** ensures that any minerals that *are* extracted and traded meet GGF standards.
    * Using **Digital Product Passports (`tool_dpp`)** to provide radical transparency, tracking a mineral from its BAZ of origin (confirming FPIC 2.0 compliance) to the final product.
    * How consumers and regenerative enterprises can use this data to make ethical sourcing decisions.

**Part III: Synthesis & Application**

* **Chapter 7: A Unified Workflow - From Proposal to Product**
    * A visual flowchart showing how a proposal for a new mineral resource project would move through all five pillars, from an initial application to a BAZ council to the final product being tracked on the global market.
* **Chapter 8: Conclusion - Building a Regenerative Material Culture**
    * Summary of how the GGF's integrated approach prevents green extractivism.
    * A call to action for stakeholders.
