### **Chapter 6: The Fifth Pillar - Ethical Supply Chains**

#### **6.1 The Gaian Trade Framework: A New Paradigm for Global Commerce**

After a resource project has passed through the rigorous gauntlets of sovereign consent, circular necessity, commons transition, and legal accountability, the GGF applies a final, crucial layer of oversight: ensuring the materials are traded ethically throughout the global economy. This is the mandate of the **Gaian Trade Framework**, the GGF's protocol for reorienting global commerce from a model of exploitation to one of mutual, regenerative benefit.

The framework’s purpose is to ensure that the integrity established at the point of origin is not lost in the complexities of the global supply chain. It provides a set of rules and technological tools to guarantee that every transaction involving GGF-stewarded materials reinforces the principles of ecological health, social equity, and Indigenous sovereignty.

#### **6.2 The Digital Product Passport: Radical Transparency from Source to Sale**

The central mechanism of the Gaian Trade Framework is the **Digital Product Passport (DPP)**. The DPP is a secure, blockchain-based, and publicly auditable record that is permanently attached to a batch of material. It acts as an immutable ledger of the material's story, providing radical transparency at every step of its journey.

For any mineral stewarded under GGF protocols, its DPP is initiated at the moment of its extraction and must, at a minimum, contain the following verifiable data points:

1.  **Sovereign Consent Verification:** The passport's first "stamp" is an immutable link to the GGF registry, proving that the material was sourced from a project that received **Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC 2.0)** from the sovereign BAZ council. Without this verification, the material is considered illicit and cannot legally enter the GGF-aligned supply chain.
2.  **Circularity Status:** The DPP must include the official determination from the **Phoenix Protocol** audit, confirming that the "Circular First" principle was followed and that this new extraction was deemed necessary.
3.  **Ecological Impact Data:** The passport is linked to the **Public Accountability Dashboard**, providing real-time or regularly updated metrics on the project’s impact on the local **Biosphere Agency Index (BAI)**.
4.  **Labor Standards Verification:** The DPP contains certification of compliance with the **Work in Liberation Framework**, ensuring that all workers involved in the stewardship process receive fair wages and operate under safe and dignified conditions.
5.  **Chain of Custody:** The blockchain ledger provides a complete, unalterable record of every transaction and every entity that has handled the material, eliminating opportunities for fraud, substitution, or "greenwashing."

#### **6.3 Empowering Ethical Choices for Enterprises and Individuals**

The Digital Product Passport is designed to be a simple yet powerful tool for decision-making at all levels of the economy.

* **For Regenerative Enterprises:** A GGF-aligned enterprise building electric vehicle batteries can scan the DPP for a shipment of cobalt. In seconds, they can verify that it originated from a BAZ-led cooperative in the Congo, that FPIC 2.0 was respected, that workers were treated ethically, and that the project is contributing positively to the local BAI. This allows them to make sourcing decisions based on verifiable truth, not just opaque certifications or marketing claims, and prove their own ethical standards to their customers.
* **For Consumers:** An individual purchasing a smartphone can scan a QR code on the box to view a simplified, user-friendly version of the DPP for its key components. They can see the story of the materials inside—the BAZ they came from, the community that stewards them, and their ecological impact. This empowers consumers to directly support regenerative and just supply chains with their purchasing power.

This final pillar closes the loop. It creates a powerful market-based incentive where transparency is rewarded and exploitation has no place to hide. Products with ethical, transparent, and regenerative DPPs will be the preferred inputs for the new global economy, ensuring that the principles of stewardship that begin on the land are carried all the way to our homes and communities.
