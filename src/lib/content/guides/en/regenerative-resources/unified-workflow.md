### **Chapter 7: A Unified Workflow - From Proposal to Product**

The five pillars of Regenerative Resource Stewardship are not standalone concepts; they are an integrated, sequential, and legally coherent workflow. This chapter provides a step-by-step overview of how a proposal for a new resource project moves through the Global Governance Framework (GGF) system, ensuring that every stage is subject to the principles of sovereignty, circularity, and accountability.

While this workflow is presented as a linear sequence, the **Fourth Pillar (The Legal Backstop)** and the **Third Pillar (The Transition to Commons)** act as constant, overarching layers of accountability and long-term vision that influence every stage of the process.

#### **The GGF Resource Stewardship Workflow**

**Stage 1: The Sovereign Gateway (The BAZ Council & FPIC 2.0)**

The process begins and ends with the sovereign authority of the local community.

* **Step 1.1: Proposal Submission:** A proposing entity (e.g., a regenerative enterprise) submits a detailed project proposal to the sovereign Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) Council in whose territory the resource is located.
* **Step 1.2: Community Review:** The BAZ Council facilitates a community-wide review, assessing the proposal against Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK), cultural values, and the principle of Seventh-Generation Accountability.
* **Step 1.3: Decision Point 1 (Veto Power):** The BAZ Council, guided by community consensus, makes its initial sovereign decision.
    * **If the decision is NO (Veto):** The process ends. The decision is legally binding and cannot be appealed to any higher authority.
    * **If the decision is YES (Proceed to consideration):** The project moves to the next stage of scrutiny.

**Stage 2: The Circular Mandate (The Phoenix Protocol)**

Sovereign consent is not enough; the project must also be proven necessary for the planetary whole.

* **Step 2.1: Mandatory Circularity Study:** The proposing entity funds an independent study, mandated by the **Phoenix Protocol**, to determine if the material need can be met using secondary, already-circulating materials (e.g., from urban mining).
* **Step 2.2: BAI Impact Assessment:** The study must include a projection of the project's negative impact on the local **Biosphere Agency Index (BAI)**.
* **Step 2.3: Decision Point 2 (Necessity & Harm):** The BAZ Council reviews the study.
    * **If a viable circular alternative exists OR the projected BAI impact is deemed too severe:** The project is rejected. This decision is final.
    * **If the project is deemed necessary AND the ecological impact is acceptable to the community:** It receives conditional approval.

**Stage 3: Project Approval & Digital Product Passport (DPP) Initiation**

Once a project is approved, its life in the regenerative economy is formally initiated.

* **Step 3.1: Formal Stewardship Contract:** The BAZ Council and the proposing entity co-design a formal stewardship contract, outlining operational rules, benefit-sharing agreements, and ecological restoration commitments.
* **Step 3.2: DPP Creation:** The project's approval, including the FPIC 2.0 consent record and the Circularity Study results, is cryptographically signed and used to create the initial **Digital Product Passport (DPP)** for the materials that will be stewarded. This DPP is now a legally recognized and traceable entity in the **Gaian Trade Framework**.

**Stage 4: Stewardship & The Ethical Supply Chain**

* **Step 4.1: Operation & Monitoring:** The project operates under the continuous oversight of the BAZ Council and designated Guardians. Its real-time impact on the local BAI is monitored on the **Public Accountability Dashboard**.
* **Step 4.2: Ethical Market Entry:** As materials are produced, their DPP is updated with verifiable data on labor standards, ecological performance, and chain of custody. The materials, now carrying their story of consent and stewardship, enter the global supply chain to be sourced by regenerative enterprises and conscious consumers.
