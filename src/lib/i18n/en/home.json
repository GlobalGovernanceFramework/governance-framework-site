    "title": "Framework Development Status",
    "text": "The Global Governance Framework is a proof-of-concept project exploring possible approaches to multi-level governance. Documentation sections vary in maturity, from conceptual to fully developed. This work aims to inspire discussion and innovation rather than presenting a finalized, operational system. These frameworks are not intended to replace human judgment or policy expertise, but to support them—providing scaffolding that can be adapted to specific contexts and democratizing access to governance thinking. We're actively refining these resources through collaborative development and welcome your feedback to shape their evolution. Check each document's status indicator for current readiness level."

    "title": "Why This Exists",
    "paragraph1": "This project began as a personal reflection: What would it take for humanity to thrive together?",
    "paragraph2": "From childhood, I (Björn Kenneth Holmström) was fascinated by animals, cultures, and the Earth as a shared home. That early sense of wonder became a lifelong drive to support ethical, compassionate systems that can serve all life—human and beyond.",
    "paragraph3": "What you see here is not a final solution. It started as a living proposal. A collaborative draft of what a more interconnected, inclusive, and future-ready form of governance might look like.",
    "paragraph4": "It’s offered openly—shaped by conversations with AI systems like Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek and Gemini, and grounded in a belief that good governance must emerge from shared wisdom. Let this be a beginning, not an answer. You are invited to explore, question, contribute, and improve it."

  "languageStatement": {
    "title": "Language and Inclusivity",
    "paragraph1": "True global governance must speak every language. For this framework to be truly universal, it must be accessible to all. We are deeply committed to making the 'Treaty for Our Only Home' and all related materials available in as many languages as possible.",
    "paragraph2": "Currently, the core documents are actively maintained in English, as a global language of diplomacy, and Swedish, the mother tongue of the initial researcher. We recognize this is only a starting point.",
    "paragraph3": "We believe the vital work of translation belongs to the community. It is a powerful way to ensure the framework's concepts are adapted accurately and resonate within different cultures. If you are a native speaker and believe in this work, we warmly invite you to help bring these ideas to your community.",
