    "title": "Framework Development Status",
    "text": "The Global Governance Frameworks is a proof-of-concept project exploring possible approaches to multi-level governance. Documentation sections vary in maturity, from conceptual to fully developed. This work aims to inspire discussion and innovation rather than presenting a finalized, operational system. These frameworks are not intended to replace human judgment or policy expertise, but to support them—providing scaffolding that can be adapted to specific contexts and democratizing access to governance thinking. We're actively refining these resources through collaborative development and welcome your feedback to shape their evolution. Check each document's status indicator for current readiness level."

    "paragraph2": "From childhood, Björn Kenneth Holmström, a.k.a 'Pwnytale' was fascinated by animals, cultures, and the Earth as a shared home. That early sense of wonder became a lifelong drive to support ethical, compassionate systems that can serve all life—human and beyond.",

This collaborative draft explores what a more interconnected, inclusive, and future-ready form of governance might look like. The challenges facing our planet are urgent, and the time for action is now. Your engagement is critical to building the future we need.",
    "paragraph4": "The frameworks are offered openly—shaped by conversations with AI systems like Claude, ChatGPT, Grok, DeepSeek and Gemini, and grounded in a belief that good governance must emerge from shared wisdom. Let this be a beginning, not an answer. You are invited to explore, question, contribute, and improve them."
