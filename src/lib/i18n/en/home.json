    "text": "The Global Governance Framework is a proof-of-concept project exploring possible approaches to multi-level governance. Documentation sections vary in maturity, from conceptual to fully developed. This work aims to inspire discussion and innovation rather than presenting a finalized, operational system. We're actively refining these resources and welcome your feedback to shape their development. Check each document's status indicator for current readiness level."

    "title": "Why This Exists",
    "paragraph1": "This project began as a personal reflection: What would it take for humanity to thrive together?",
    "paragraph2": "From childhood, I (Björn Kenneth Holmström) was fascinated by animals, cultures, and the Earth as a shared home. That early sense of wonder became a lifelong drive to support ethical, compassionate systems that can serve all life—human and beyond.",
    "paragraph3": "What you see here is not a final solution. It’s a living proposal. A collaborative draft of what a more interconnected, inclusive, and future-ready form of governance might look like.",
    "paragraph4": "It’s offered openly—shaped by conversations with AI systems like Claude, ChatGPT, Grok and DeepSeek, and grounded in a belief that good governance must emerge from shared wisdom. Let this be a beginning, not an answer. You are invited to explore, question, contribute, and improve it."
