# Welcome to Our New Blog!

This is the first post on our new **Global Governance Frameworks** blog, powered by [SvelteKit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) and [MDSveX](https://mdsvex.com/).

You can write your content here using [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## What is Markdown?

Markdown is a lightweight markup language that allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text format, then convert it to structurally valid HTML.

* It's simple.
* It's widely used.
* It's great for content creation.

You can even embed Svelte components directly! For example:
<script>
  let count = 0;
</script>

<p>This is a Svelte component: <button on:click={() => count++}>Clicks: {count}</button></p>

Stay tuned for more updates on the [Treaty for Our Only Home](https://globalgovernanceframework.org/frameworks/docs/implementation/treaty-for-our-only-home).
