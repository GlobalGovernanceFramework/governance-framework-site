The Conduit Protocol recognizes that fossil fuel infrastructure has devastated communities for generations‚Äîfrom coal mines poisoning Appalachian water sources to oil refineries creating cancer clusters in Louisiana‚Äôs Cancer Alley. Black Americans are roughly 75% more likely to live in communities proximate to high-emission or toxic industrial processes, and typically endure levels of air pollution at least 56% higher than what would be equitable. This transformation must repair these injustices while supporting the workers and communities who built our energy systems.</p> <h2><strong>üè≠ Fossil Fuel Decommissioning Trust</strong></h2> <p><em>Comprehensive reparations and restoration for communities harmed by extractive infrastructure</em></p> <details><summary><strong>Reparations Levy & Corporate Accountability</strong></summary> <p>The <strong>Fossil Fuel Decommissioning Trust (<code>institution_decom_trust</code>)</strong> represents a fundamental shift in who pays for infrastructure transformation. Rather than burdening communities with cleanup costs, the Trust is funded through a <strong>Reparations Levy</strong> on fossil fuel corporations via the <strong>Corporate Reparations Protocol (<code>framework_hearthstone</code>)</strong> and the <strong>Global Commons Fund (<code>mechanism_gcf</code>)</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Funding Sources & Corporate Responsibility:</strong></p>
