It is about honoring the skills, dignity, and dedication of the workforce while creating new opportunities for them to build a healthier future. The GGF’s commitment is that no worker will be left behind. Instead, they will be empowered to become the stewards of their community’s regeneration. This is achieved through the <strong>Work in Liberation Framework</strong>, which provides the organizational infrastructure for new forms of dignified, purposeful work.</p> <ul><li><p><strong>From Worker to Steward:</strong> For decades, the identity of many communities has been tied to a single industry. The end of that industry can feel like a loss of purpose. The <strong>Work in Liberation Framework</strong> reframes this narrative. It is not about finding replacement jobs, but about transforming the very meaning of work. Former industrial workers are invited to become the stewards of their own communities—the skilled, respected leaders of the ecological and social healing that needs to be done.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Creating a Just Transition Service Corps:</strong> To manage this transformation, the community establishes a <strong>Just Transition Service Corps</strong>—a dedicated branch of the <strong>Community Work Teams</strong> specifically for retraining and employing workers from the sunsetted industry. This is a practical, hands-on program:</p> <ol><li><strong>Onboarding:</strong> Former workers are invited to join the Corps via the user-friendly <strong>Community Work App</strong>, which can be accessed on simple mobile devices or offline kiosks.</li> <li><strong>Retraining and Skills Matching:</strong> The Corps offers paid, BAZ-certified training programs in new fields like ecosystem restoration, renewable energy installation, and commons management. The App’s <strong>Skills Resonance Matching</strong> tool helps identify how a worker’s existing skills (e.g., engineering, project management) can be adapted to new regenerative tasks.</li> <li><strong>Deployment:</strong> Once certified, workers are deployed in their own community on projects managed by the Stewardship Trust, turning their labor toward healing the very land their former industry once harmed.</li></ol></li> <li><p><strong>The New Work of Restoration:</strong> The Just Transition Service Corps is not a temporary relief program; it is the engine of the new regenerative economy. The work is essential, dignified, and immediately available. It includes:</p> <ul><li><strong>Ecological Restoration:</strong> Safely decontaminating former industrial sites, restoring local waterways, rewilding degraded lands, and managing biodiversity projects.</li> <li><strong>Safe Decommissioning of Old Infrastructure:</strong> The highly skilled task of dismantling old factories, mines, and power plants in a way that is safe for workers and the environment.</li> <li><strong>Building New Renewable Energy Systems:</strong> Constructing and maintaining community-owned solar, wind, or geothermal projects, often on the restored industrial land.</li> <li><strong>Managing the New Commons:</strong> The ongoing stewardship of the community’s land, water, and infrastructure now held within the Trust.</li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Case Study Snippet:</strong> In the Ruhr Valley, the Just Transition Service Corps becomes the region’s largest employer. Former steelworkers, now retrained and certified, are proudly employed in the multi-year project of decontaminating the old factory site and restoring the health of the local river ecosystem. Their work is not just a job; it is a visible act of healing their home.</p></li></ul>",1);function d(e){var t=o();n(6),r(e,t)}export{d as default};
