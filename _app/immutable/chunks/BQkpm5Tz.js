Communities or institutions temporarily implement proposals as time-bound experiments with built-in review periods and exit strategies.</p> <p><strong><code>propose(solution)</code></strong><br> The second EGP system call. Anyone can suggest responses to sense signals, but must include test criteria, timeline, resources needed, and automatic sunset clauses.</p> <p><strong><code>sense(issue)</code></strong><br> The first EGP system call. Any agent (human, AI, sensor, community) can flag a systemic stressor or opportunity using standardized data formats.</p> <p><strong>Emergent Governance Protocol (EGP)</strong><br> The Minimum Viable Grammar for governance—three universal operations that enable simple, interoperable coordination without imposing specific decision-making processes.</p> <p><strong>Minimum Viable Grammar (MVG)</strong><br> The philosophical foundation of EGP: providing simple, combinable elements that enable infinite governance expressions rather than trying to design perfect systems.</p> <p><strong>Stress Packet</strong><br> Standardized data output from <code>sense()</code> operations containing location, severity, affected parties, evidence, and urgency information in machine-readable format.</p> <p><strong>Sunset Clause</strong><br> Automatic expiration date built into all <code>propose()</code> and <code>adopt()</code> operations. Nothing is permanent—good ideas get renewed, bad ones die naturally.</p> <p><strong>System Call</strong><br> Computing term borrowed for governance: fundamental operations that any agent can invoke, similar to how computer programs make basic requests to the operating system.</p> <hr> <h2>Global Governance Framework (GGF) Terms</h2> <p><strong>Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI)</strong><br> Economic framework providing basic income through Hearts (social currency) and Leaves (ecological currency), rewarding care work and environmental restoration.</p> <p><strong>Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ)</strong><br> Indigenous-led governance systems organized around ecosystem boundaries rather than colonial borders, implementing traditional ecological knowledge and consensus decision-making.</p> <p><strong>Digital Justice Tribunal</strong><br> Global judicial body established by the Treaty for Our Only Home, with authority to prosecute ecocide, digital rights violations, and other planetary-scale harms.</p> <p><strong>Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC)</strong><br> International standard requiring Indigenous communities’ agreement before any activities affecting their territories, data, or traditional knowledge.</p> <p><strong>Global Commons Fund (GCF)</strong><br> Funding mechanism established by the Treaty, financed through global taxes (carbon tax, financial transaction tax) to support planetary public goods and climate action.</p> <p><strong>Hearts Currency</strong><br> Social currency within AUBI framework that rewards care work, community building, cultural preservation, and social contributions to well-being.</p> <p><strong>Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework</strong><br> The ethical foundation of the GGF, centering Indigenous sovereignty, traditional ecological knowledge, and land-based governance as guides for all other frameworks.</p> <p><strong>Leaves Currency</strong><br> Ecological currency within AUBI framework that rewards verified ecosystem restoration, biodiversity conservation, and environmental stewardship activities.</p> <p><strong>Love Ledger</strong><br> Decentralized platform for logging and validating contributions of care work, ecological restoration, and community building that generates Hearts and Leaves rewards.</p> <p><strong>Meta-Governance</strong><br> Coordination framework enabling different governance systems to work together without imposing uniformity—“governance of governance” across domains and scales.</p> <p><strong>Treaty for Our Only Home</strong><br> Constitutional framework providing legal foundation, institutional reforms, and enforcement mechanisms that enable all other GGF frameworks to operate globally.</p> <hr> <h2>Technical Terms</h2> <p><strong>API (Application Programming Interface)</strong><br> Technical standard allowing different software systems to communicate and share data, adapted for governance to enable coordination between different frameworks and communities.</p> <p><strong>Interoperability</strong><br> Ability of different systems to work together and exchange information effectively while maintaining their unique characteristics and decision-making processes.</p> <p><strong>JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)</strong><br> Standard data format used for EGP operations, making governance data machine-readable and easily shareable between different platforms and systems.</p> <p><strong>Machine-Readable Data</strong><br> Information formatted so computers can process and analyze it automatically, enabling rapid coordination and pattern recognition across large networks.</p> <hr> <h2>Governance Philosophy Terms</h2> <p><strong>Cathedral vs. Bazaar</strong><br> Eric Raymond’s distinction between top-down designed systems (cathedral) and bottom-up emergent systems (bazaar). EGP embraces the bazaar approach for operational governance.</p> <p><strong>Polycentric Coordination</strong><br> Governance principle where power is shared across many centers rather than concentrated in single authorities, enabling local autonomy with global coordination.</p> <p><strong>Subsidiarity</strong><br> Principle that decisions should be made at the most local level possible, with higher levels providing support only when local capacity is insufficient.</p> <p><strong>Unix Philosophy</strong><br> Software design approach emphasizing simple, modular, composable tools that “do one thing well”—the inspiration for EGP’s minimal, interoperable approach to governance.</p> <p><strong>“Worse is Better”</strong><br> Design philosophy prioritizing simplicity and adaptability over perfection—an adaptive “good enough” solution that can be implemented now beats a perfect one that never arrives.</p> <hr> <h2>Cultural and Rights Terms</h2> <p><strong>Ceremonial Governance</strong><br> Decision-making processes that integrate ritual, spiritual practices, and traditional protocols, recognizing governance as sacred relationship rather than purely technical activity.</p> <p><strong>Rights of Nature</strong><br> Legal recognition that ecosystems, rivers, forests, and other natural entities have inherent rights independent of human utility, often implemented through Indigenous advocacy.</p> <p><strong>Seven-Generation Thinking</strong><br> Indigenous governance principle requiring all major decisions to consider impacts on the seventh generation to come (approximately 200 years), ensuring long-term sustainability.</p> <p><strong>Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)</strong><br> Indigenous and traditional knowledge systems about ecological relationships, sustainable practices, and land-based governance developed over millennia of direct relationship with specific places.</p> <hr> <p><strong>Document Version:</strong> 1.0<br> <strong>Related Documents:</strong> <a href="#emergent-governance-protocol">EGP Core Framework</a> | <a href="#egp-one-page-summary">One-Page Summary</a> | <a href="#egp-appendix">Implementation Appendix</a><br> <strong>License:</strong> Creative Commons ShareAlike 4.0</p>',1);function l(e){var n=a();t(90),r(e,n)}export{l as default};
