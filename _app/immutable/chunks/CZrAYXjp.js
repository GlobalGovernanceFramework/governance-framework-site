Tracking your time is not about control, but about <strong>awareness</strong> – both for your own sake and to be able to log your <code>Hearts</code> fairly.</p> <p>You are completely free to use the method that works best for you.</p> <h2><strong>Option 1: Pen and Paper</strong></h2> <p>The simplest system is often the best. Have a notebook dedicated to GGF. Write down when you start working on a task and when you finish. Sum up the hours at the end of the day or week.</p> <h2><strong>Option 2: A Simple Timer App</strong></h2> <p>Use the timer or stopwatch on your mobile phone.</p> <h2><strong>Option 3: TiTo Time Tracker (Our Recommended Tool)</strong></h2> <p>I (Björn K. Holmström) have developed my own tool, <strong>TiTo Time Tracker</strong>, which is designed to be simple, free, and respect your privacy. All data is stored locally in your browser. It’s an excellent tool for this purpose.</p> <ul><li><strong>How to use TiTo for GGF:</strong> <ol><li>Open TiTo in your browser (either locally (download from <a href="https://bjornkennethholmstrom.wordpress.com/tito/" rel="nofollow">my website</a>) or directly via <a href="https://bjornkennethholmstrom.github.io/TiTo/" rel="nofollow">GitHub page</a>).</li> <li>Create a new project that you name “GGF Catalyst”.</li> <li>Every time you start working with GGF, select the “GGF Catalyst” project and start the timer.</li> <li>When you’re done for the day, you can see the total time you’ve spent. You can then transfer that sum to our shared Love Ledger.</li></ol></li></ul> <p>Using TiTo is a good way for us to “eat our own dog food” and see if the tools we build actually meet the needs we have. If you use it and have feedback on how it can be improved, that feedback is itself a valuable contribution!</p>',1);function h(o){var e=n();a(20),r(o,e)}export{h as default};
