This requires an economic engine that runs on a different fuel: not extraction and scarcity, but security, care, and ecological health. The <strong>Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI) Framework</strong> provides this engine, creating a resilient economic foundation that supports every individual and rewards the work of healing and regeneration.</p> <ul><li><p><strong>The Economic Safety Net:</strong> A transition of this magnitude is only possible if every community member is free from the fear of economic ruin. The AUBI Framework provides this stability through its <strong>Layer 1 Universal Baseline</strong>. This is an unconditional, recurring payment to every adult, delivered as a hybrid of traditional fiat currency and <strong>Hearts</strong>, the GGF’s currency for the care economy. This ensures that everyone can cover their basic needs for housing, food, and utilities, creating the social and economic stability necessary for the entire community to navigate the transition with confidence.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Rewarding the Work of Healing:</strong> The AUBI system moves beyond a simple safety net to create a vibrant new economy. Through its <strong>Layer 2 Contribution Bonus</strong>, it directly rewards the “Work With Purpose” being done by the Just Transition Service Corps and other community members.</p> <ul><li>The essential ecological restoration and decommissioning work is rewarded with <strong>Leaves</strong>, the GGF’s currency for planetary stewardship.</li> <li>The social and care work—mentoring, community organizing, elder care—is rewarded with <strong>Hearts</strong>.</li> <li>All contributions are transparently logged and verified on the blockchain-based <strong>Love Ledger</strong>, creating a new, regenerative income stream for the community based on its healing and flourishing.</li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Seeding New Enterprises:</strong> With the community stabilized and the restoration work underway, the AUBI system helps seed the next generation of local businesses. The <strong>Global Commons Fund (GCF)</strong>, a core mechanism of the <em>Treaty for Our Only Home</em>, provides grants and seed funding for new worker cooperatives and regenerative enterprises. This allows the community to build on its new foundation, creating businesses—from renewable energy installation to local food production and circular economy manufacturing—that are owned by the community and aligned with its new regenerative purpose.</p></li> <li><p><strong>Case Study Snippet:</strong> While the Ruhr Valley site is being restored, all residents receive their monthly AUBI <strong>Layer 1</strong> payment, ending generations of economic precarity. The workers in the Just Transition Service Corps earn additional <strong><code>Leaves</code></strong> for their ecological restoration work, logged in the <strong>Love Ledger</strong> and exchangeable for goods and services. Seeing an opportunity, a group of retrained engineers forms a new worker cooperative. They successfully apply for a grant from the <strong>Global Commons Fund</strong> and begin the historic work of building a community-owned solar farm on the cleaned-up site of the former steel plant.</p></li></ul>",1);function d(e){var n=i();o(4),t(e,n)}export{d as default};
