Health authorities fought the disease while economic systems collapsed communities, educational institutions abandoned children, and environmental policies ignored the ecological origins of pandemic risk. Meanwhile, Indigenous communities that understood health as inseparable from ecological relationship and social connection often responded more effectively than formal health systems. The Framework Integration architecture of the Global Health & Pandemic Security Framework emerges from this recognition: health security cannot be achieved in isolation but requires coordination across all domains of governance while maintaining the specialized expertise and community sovereignty that makes each framework effective.</em></p> <h2><a id="integration-planetary-coordination"></a>Integration as Planetary Health Coordination</h2> <h3>Health as Systems Integration</h3> <p>The Global Health & Pandemic Security Framework serves as the specialized health security component within the broader Global Governance Framework ecosystem, providing expertise in pandemic prevention and response while coordinating with other frameworks to
