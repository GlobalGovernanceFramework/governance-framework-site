This section outlines resource requirements for implementing Indigenous-led disaster governance, providing stakeholders with practical guidance on securing and managing resources through Treaty mechanisms, Traditional knowledge systems, and Meta-Governance coordination in ways that strengthen rather than extract from Indigenous communities and Traditional knowledge systems.</p> <p>By anticipating resource needs and planning through Indigenous-controlled approaches, stakeholders can ensure that implementation builds Traditional Ecological Knowledge capacity, enhances Indigenous sovereignty, and supports Traditional territories while providing effective disaster resilience across diverse bioregional contexts. All resource allocation must follow Indigenous protocols, utilize Treaty financing mechanisms, and deploy Meta-Governance coordination while maintaining Traditional knowledge protection and community self-determination.</p> <h2>Global Stewardship Fund Financial Resources 💰</h2> <p>Financial resources for Indigenous-led disaster governance center on Global Stewardship Fund mechanisms that provide direct Indigenous access to Treaty financing while supporting Traditional Ecological Knowledge application, Indigenous sovereignty enhancement, and regenerative approaches that heal rather than extract from Traditional territories and Traditional knowledge systems.</p> <h3>Treaty Financing Mechanism Deployment</h3> <p><strong>Direct Indigenous Access to Global Resources</strong>: Global Stewardship Fund provides Indigenous communities with independent financing that bypasses colonial government control:</p> <ul><li><strong>Phase 1 (Years 1-2): Foundation Building</strong> - $5-10M per bioregion for Traditional Ecological Knowledge documentation, Traditional governance capacity building, Indigenous research protocols establishment, and Traditional knowledge transmission programs that strengthen Traditional authority</li> <li><strong>Phase 2 (Years 3-5): Capacity Expansion</strong> - $15-25M per bioregion for Traditional technology integration, Bioregional Autonomous Zone infrastructure, Traditional knowledge-based early warning systems, and Indigenous governance coordination networks</li> <li><strong>Phase 3 (Years 5+): Full Implementation</strong> - $50M+ annually per bioregion for comprehensive Traditional knowledge application, Indigenous economic development, Traditional territory restoration, and Traditional knowledge-based climate adaptation at scale</li></ul> <p><strong>Indigenous Priority Resource Allocation</strong>: Global Stewardship Fund prioritizes Indigenous-controlled initiatives over external technical solutions:</p> <ul><li><strong>Traditional Ecological Knowledge Application Priority</strong>: 60% of disaster resilience funding supports Traditional knowledge implementation, Traditional skill development, and
