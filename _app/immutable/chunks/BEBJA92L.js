Their approach demonstrates how technology can serve democratic governance rather than surveillance capitalism. Local self-government institutions control data and decision-making while citizens access services through multiple channels including mobile apps, community centers, and offline systems that ensure universal access regardless of economic status or technological capacity.</em></p> <p><em>Kerala’s success emerges from treating technology as public infrastructure rather than private property, ensuring democratic control over essential systems rather than dependence on corporate platforms that extract value while providing services. Hearts and Leaves technical infrastructure learns from Kerala’s model while extending democratic technology principles to community-controlled economic systems that serve sovereignty rather than
