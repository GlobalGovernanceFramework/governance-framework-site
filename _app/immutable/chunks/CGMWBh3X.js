As communities worldwide face increasing disaster risks intensified by climate change, social vulnerabilities, and ecosystem degradation, this framework offers a regenerative blueprint for collaborative action that centers Indigenous sovereignty, Traditional knowledge wisdom, and ecological stewardship while deploying Treaty mechanisms and Meta-Governance coordination to serve both immediate disaster needs and long-term planetary healing.</p> <p>By integrating Traditional Ecological Knowledge systems with Treaty institutional mechanisms and Meta-Governance coordination protocols, this framework provides a foundation for transformative change in how societies prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters through approaches that strengthen rather than extract from Indigenous communities, Traditional knowledge systems, and Traditional territories.</p> <h2>Framework Summary Within Golden Triangle Ecosystem üìã</h2> <p>The DRR&R Implementation Framework is distinguished by its integration within the Golden Triangle ecosystem, operationalizing Treaty mechanisms, Indigenous wisdom, and Meta-Governance coordination to create disaster governance that serves Traditional knowledge and Indigenous sovereignty:</p> <p><strong>Golden Triangle Ecosystem Integration</strong>: The framework functions as the operational bridge between the Treaty‚Äôs institutional ‚Äúhardware,‚Äù the Indigenous Framework‚Äôs cultural ‚Äúheart and soul,‚Äù and Meta-Governance‚Äôs coordination ‚Äúnervous system,‚Äù transforming abstract governance principles into practical disaster resilience that heals Traditional territories and strengthens Traditional knowledge systems.</p> <p><strong>Treaty Mechanism Deployment</strong>: Through Global Stewardship Fund disaster financing, Rights of Nature ecosystem protection, Global Enforcement Mechanism coordination, and international accountability frameworks, the framework provides institutional support for Indigenous-led disaster governance while maintaining Traditional authority over resource allocation and Traditional knowledge application.</p> <p><strong>Indigenous Sovereignty Foundation</strong>: Traditional Ecological Knowledge serves as foundational wisdom guiding all disaster governance, Bioregional Autonomous Zone authority ensures Indigenous control over traditional territories, and
