We carry in our bones the memory of economies where care was currency, where helping hands multiplied abundance, where enough for all was not a distant dream but daily practice.</p> <p>Somewhere, we learned to count what should flow freely and hoard what should circulate. We built scarcity from the materials of abundance, made poverty from the blueprints of plenty. We forgot that an economy is not a machine for extraction, but a living system for circulation—like blood through a body, like rainfall through a watershed, like love through a community.</p> <p>But the original instructions remain written in every act of care, every shared meal, every hand extended in welcome. They speak in Indigenous gift economies and mutual aid networks, in community gardens and time banks, in every parent choosing children’s futures over present profit.</p> <p>Let us remember: we are not economic units competing for scarce resources. We are living beings designed for abundance, participants in the endless circulation of gift and gratitude that keeps worlds alive.</p> <p>Let economic security become what it was always meant to be: the foundation upon which human creativity can flourish, the soil in which communities can grow, the promise that every person’s gifts will find welcome and every need will find answer in the great turning wheel of care that we call home.</p> <p>This is our covenant: to build an economy of Right Relationship, where money serves life rather than ruling it, where everyone has enough, and where prosperity means the flourishing of all beings on our only home.</p>",1);function m(e){var t=r();i(14),a(e,t)}export{m as default,o as metadata};
