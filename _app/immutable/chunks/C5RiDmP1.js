To make this concrete, we use a <strong>“Love Ledger”</strong> where we log our contributions, which we measure in <strong><code>Hearts</code></strong>.</p> <p>Before we have a complete technical system for this, we start in the simplest possible way: with a shared document.</p> <h2><strong>Why do we have a Love Ledger?</strong></h2> <ul><li><strong>To value all work:</strong> It ensures that all types of contributions – writing, research, translation, feedback, or supporting a colleague – become visible and valued.</li> <li><strong>For transparency:</strong> It creates an open and honest foundation for how we distribute any financial resources in the future.</li> <li><strong>For motivation:</strong> It gives us a concrete picture of the shared momentum we are building together.</li></ul> <h2><strong>How does it work? (Our simple system)</strong></h2> <ol><li><strong>The tool:</strong> We use a shared online document (e.g., Google Docs or a text file in our shared GitHub project) as our first Love Ledger.</li> <li><strong>The structure:</strong> The document is a simple table with four columns:
| Date | Who | What (Short description of contribution) | Hearts (hours) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 2025-07-15 | Björn | Wrote draft guide for Love Ledger | 1.5 |
| 2025-07-16 | Emil | Read welcome kit and gave feedback | 2.0 |</li> <li><strong>The process:</strong> <ul><li>When you have made a contribution, open the shared document.</li> <li>Add a new row with today’s date, your name, a short description of what you did, and an estimate of the time it took.</li> <li><strong>One hour of contribution equals one <code>Heart</code></strong>. It’s a simple starting point.</li></ul></li></ol> <p>This system is a direct expression of our values: <strong>radical autonomy</strong> (you log your own contribution) and <strong>radical transparency</strong> (everyone can see everyone’s contributions).</p>`,1);function u(e){var o=s();n(14),r(e,o)}export{u as default};
