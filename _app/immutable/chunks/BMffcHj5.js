Our framework honors these gifts while weaving them into patterns that serve the healing of our shared home.”</em></p></blockquote> <p>The Gaian Trade Framework recognizes that true regenerative commerce must emerge from the soil of local cultures, ecosystems, and governance traditions rather than being imposed from above. Regional integration ensures that global trade patterns serve rather than undermine bioregional resilience, Indigenous sovereignty, and cultural diversity while maintaining the coherence necessary for planetary stewardship.</p> <h2>Bioregional Adaptation Protocols: Rooting Trade in Place</h2> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Comprehensive frameworks ensuring implementation respects local ecological
