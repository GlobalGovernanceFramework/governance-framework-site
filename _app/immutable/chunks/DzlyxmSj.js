These frameworks combine quantitative tracking with qualitative assessment, Indigenous evaluation methods with contemporary social science, and community storytelling with data analysis to ensure the transformation serves life rather than statistics.</p> <h2><a id="community-wellbeing-index"></a>Community Wellbeing Index</h2> <blockquote><p><em>“True wealth is the wellbeing of all our relations—human and more-than-human.”</em></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Purpose</strong>: The Community Wellbeing Index provides comprehensive assessment of how Work in Liberation affects individual and collective flourishing, moving beyond economic indicators to measure the full spectrum of human and ecological health.</p> <h3>Holistic Health Measurement</h3> <p><strong>Love, Meaning, and Connection Index (LMCI) Integration</strong>: Primary wellbeing framework aligned with <a href="/frameworks/aubi">AUBI Framework</a> measurement systems:</p> <ul><li><strong>Love (Care & Relationships)</strong> (40% weight): Quality of interpersonal relationships, community support networks, intergenerational connection, and mutual aid effectiveness</li> <li><strong>Meaning (Purpose & Growth)</strong> (30% weight): Sense of purpose in work, opportunities for learning and creativity, alignment between values and daily activities</li> <li><strong>Connection (Human-Land Harmony)</strong> (30% weight): Relationship with local ecosystems, participation in traditional practices, spiritual connection to place and community</li></ul> <p><strong>Mental Health and Stress Assessment</strong>: Measuring psychological impacts of work transformation:</p> <ul><li><strong>Work-Related Stress Reduction</strong>: Decreased anxiety about economic security, improved work-life balance, reduced burnout and exhaustion</li> <li><strong>Sense of Agency</strong>: Increased feeling of control over work choices, ability to refuse exploitative situations, participation in decision-making</li> <li><strong>Community Belonging</strong>: Strengthened social connections, reduced isolation, increased trust in community support systems</li> <li><strong>Trauma

Traditional and Contemporary Indicators</strong></p> <p>In Aotearoa New Zealand’s emerging BAZ, <strong>Community Wellbeing Index</strong> assessment integrates traditional Māori health concepts like hauora (holistic wellbeing) with contemporary indicators. <strong>Community Work Teams</strong> contribute to whakapapa (genealogical connections), whenua (land relationships), and whakatōhea (tribal identity) while earning <strong>Hearts</strong> and <strong>Leaves</strong> measured through both quantitative data and traditional storytelling evaluation methods.</p> <p><strong>GGF Mechanisms in
