Through nested democratic structures that operate from community councils to global coordination, this system ensures that those most affected by supply chain decisions have the greatest voice in shaping them.</em></p> <h2><a id="democratic-governance-architecture"></a>Multi-Level Democratic Governance Architecture</h2> <h3>Nested Sovereignty and Distributed Authority</h3> <p>The GSCL governance system operates through four interconnected levels that maintain community sovereignty while enabling global coordination and crisis response.</p> <p><strong>Governance Level Hierarchy and
