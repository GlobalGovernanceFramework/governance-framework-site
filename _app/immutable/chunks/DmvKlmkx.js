The Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework emerges from deep respect for this leadership—offering one possible pathway for supporting and learning from Indigenous sovereignty, ecological wisdom, and traditional governance systems that have sustained life for millennia.
This framework is presented as an invitation for dialogue and co-creation, recognizing Indigenous peoples not as stakeholders to consult, but as the primary teachers and decision-makers in any genuine transformation toward regenerative governance. Rooted in principles of decolonization and ecological relationship, these ideas are offered humbly for Indigenous community review, adaptation, or redirection according to traditional protocols and community priorities.
Every element within this framework—from concepts to implementation approaches—is offered in the spirit of learning and service, with the understanding that authentic transformation must be Indigenous-led at every level, guided by the wisdom of those who have never stopped practicing right relationship with the Earth.</p> <h2><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h2> <p><strong>Framework Position</strong>: This Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework is offered as one contribution to the broader conversation about regenerative governance, drawing from the wisdom of Indigenous communities who have maintained sustainable relationships with the Earth across millennia. It suggests ways that Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Indigenous sovereignty might inform and guide coordination efforts, recognizing that Indigenous peoples hold the foundational wisdom for any genuine transformation toward planetary stewardship.</p> <p>Rather than prescribing solutions, this framework presents possibilities for how bioregional governance, rights of nature, and ceremonial stewardship might be woven together—always with the understanding that such integration must emerge from Indigenous leadership and community guidance. The approaches outlined here are informed by and seek to align with the principles of frameworks like the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples (UNDRIP), the Paris Agreement, and emerging Rights of Nature legislation, while recognizing that traditional governance systems often transcend and predate these formal structures.</p> <p>This work is shared with deep respect for the diversity of Indigenous governance traditions worldwide, understanding that each community holds unique wisdom about right relationship with their territories. The concepts presented are offered as starting points for conversation, adaptation, or complete reimagining according to the protocols and priorities of Indigenous communities themselves.</p> <h3>Version 1.0: A Draft for Community Dialogue</h3> <p>This document is the first draft (Version 1.0) of the framework, now ready for community dialogue and review. It has been developed through extensive research and is guided by Indigenous governance principles from around the world. The text offers examples of detailed mechanisms for consideration, all grounded in a commitment to Indigenous-led transformation and strict cultural integrity.</p> <p><strong>An Invitation for Indigenous Community Review</strong></p> <p>This draft is explicitly shared for review, feedback, and guidance from Indigenous communities, traditional knowledge keepers, and cultural authorities. A core principle of this work is the <strong>Red Lines Clause</strong>, which ensures Indigenous communities retain complete authority over their engagement and can modify, disregard, or withdraw from any part of this framework. We recognize that authentic transformation must be Indigenous-led at every level.</p> <p><strong>On Readiness and Right Timing</strong></p> <p>Should any community find these ideas resonant enough to explore further, we trust and affirm that all such explorations will be guided by their own traditional governance systems. The path forward, including any consideration of pilot implementations, naturally begins with a community’s own timing, elder consultation, and cultural protocols.</p> <p><strong>Guiding Vision & Core Concepts for Exploration</strong></p> <p>This work is inspired by a vision of profound transformation. It invites us to ask: <em>What if planetary governance could emerge from regenerative, Indigenous-led stewardship? What if our economies, technologies, and legal systems were guided by the wisdom of Traditional Ecological Knowledge?</em></p> <p><strong>Examples of Transformative Possibilities</strong></p> <p>Instead of setting predetermined targets, we offer these as examples of the kinds of life-affirming outcomes that could emerge from such a transformation:</p> <ul><li>The flourishing of biodiversity within sovereign Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs).</li> <li>The revitalization of Indigenous languages and cultural practices.</li> <li>The rematriation of significant land areas to Indigenous stewardship.</li> <li>The establishment of meaningful reparative agreements and flows of resources for regeneration.</li> <li>The global adoption of well-being metrics, like Gross Planetary Health, to guide our collective decisions.</li></ul> <p><strong>Core Concepts for Exploration</strong></p> <p>To spark this conversation, this framework offers several core concepts for discussion, adaptation, or reimagining:</p> <ul><li><strong>Bioregional Autonomous Zones (BAZs)</strong> with Indigenous sovereignty and ecosystem-based governance.</li> <li>An <strong>Earth Council (Kawsay Pacha)</strong> to provide moral guidance and planetary coordination.</li> <li><strong>Traditional Knowledge Protection</strong> through new forms of data sovereignty.</li> <li><strong>Regenerative Economics</strong> centered on well-being metrics and ecological reparations.</li> <li><strong>Indigenous AI Governance</strong> to ensure technology is guided by Traditional Ecological Knowledge.</li> <li>A transition toward <strong>Ceremonial Stewardship</strong> and ritual-based governance.</li> <li><strong>Comprehensive Safeguards</strong> including the Red Lines Clause and cultural integrity protocols.</li> <li><strong>Intergenerational Accountability</strong> through long-term foresight and future-generations tribunals.</li></ul> <h2><a id="exploring"></a>Exploring the Framework’s Concepts</h2> <p>The ideas in this repository are organized into the following sections for exploration.
