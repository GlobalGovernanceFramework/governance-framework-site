Operating through the institutional authority of the <a href="/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home">Treaty for Our Only Home</a>, guided by the <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge">Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework</a>, and coordinated through the <a href="/frameworks/meta-governance">Integrated Meta-Governance Framework</a>, this framework moves beyond consultation to genuine power redistribution and Indigenous leadership.</p> <h2><a id="transformed-stakeholder-relations"></a>Transformed Stakeholder Relations</h2> <h3>From Consultation to Indigenous Sovereignty</h3> <p>The stakeholder engagement approach fundamentally transforms
