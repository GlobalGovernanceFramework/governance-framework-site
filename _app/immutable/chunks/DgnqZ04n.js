When we say ‘data sovereignty’ instead of ‘data protection,’ when we speak of ‘sacred trust’ rather than ‘user agreements,’ when we choose ‘community control’ over ‘stakeholder engagement’—we transform not just language but the very foundation of how power flows in the digital age.”</em><br> — Digital Justice Glossary Project, 2025</p></blockquote> <p><strong>In this section:</strong></p> <ul><li><a href="#core-framework-terms">Core Framework Terms</a></li> <li><a href="#governance-bodies">Governance Bodies and Institutions</a></li> <li><a href="#rights-principles">Rights and Principles</a></li> <li><a href="#technical-policy">Technical and Policy Mechanisms</a></li> <li><a href="#economic-legal">Economic and Legal Concepts</a></li> <li><a href="#cultural-community">Cultural and Community Terms</a></li> <li><a href="#implementation-process">Implementation and Process Terms</a></li></ul> <p><strong>Estimated Reading Time</strong>: 8 minutes</p> <p><em>Language shapes reality. When Amara, the Kenyan farmer, opens her “consent dashboard” instead of clicking “I agree” to incomprehensible terms of service, she exercises meaningful choice rather than performative consent. When the Sámi Parliament asserts “data sovereignty” over traditional territory information rather than accepting “consultation” on external research, they claim authority rather than influence. When young people demand “intergenerational impact assessment” instead of hoping adults will consider their futures, they exercise democratic power rather than moral suasion. This glossary provides the conceptual vocabulary for transformation from data extraction to data sovereignty.</em></p> <h2><a id="core-framework-terms"></a>Core Framework Terms</h2> <h3><strong>Aurora Accord</strong></h3> <p>The binding international agreement establishing global data governance under Treaty for Our Only Home authority.
