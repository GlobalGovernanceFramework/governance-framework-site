Our culture is a direct application of the principles we advocate in our frameworks.</p> <h2><strong>‚ù§Ô∏è Value and Compensation: A <code>Hearts</code>-Based System</strong></h2> <p>We are a <code>Hearts</code>-based organization, which is a system built on trust, autonomy, and a commitment to valuing care work and other meaningful contributions.</p> <ul><li><strong>Our unit of account is <code>Heart</code>:</strong> A <code>Heart</code> is a measure of a recognized contribution to our shared mission. It can be anything from research and writing to giving feedback, supporting a colleague, or other work that moves us forward.</li> <li><strong>The mechanism is <code>Love Ledger</code>:</strong> Each member is responsible for logging their contributions in our internal <strong>Love Ledger</strong>. This is an expression of our principle of <strong>radical autonomy</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Transparency is our security:</strong> All logged contributions are visible to all other members. This mutual visibility, in a culture of high trust, replaces hierarchical control and ensures fairness.</li> <li><strong>The bridge to today‚Äôs economy:</strong> The association has a budget in regular currency (SEK/EUR) from grants and contributions. Each month, the available budget is divided by the total number of <code>Hearts</code> logged by all members. This creates a temporary exchange rate that enables members to invoice the association for their contributions.</li> <li><strong>Completely voluntary:</strong> The system is voluntary and without coercion. You contribute as much or as little as you want and can. The <code>Hearts</code> system is a tool for fair distribution, not an obligation.</li></ul> <h2><strong>üß† Autonomy and Coordination</strong></h2> <p>Our organization is a network built on high trust and great freedom.</p> <ul><li><strong>Freedom to contribute:</strong> You have complete freedom over your working hours, your workplace, and your equipment. We measure contributions in results and progress, not in hours worked.</li> <li><strong>Coordination through documentation:</strong> In exchange for this freedom, our most important habit is making our work and our thoughts visible through careful documentation. Our shared digital workspace is our collective brain.</li> <li><strong>Meetings are a resource, not a requirement:</strong> All meetings are optional. They are used only when we need to co-create or make decisions that are difficult to handle asynchronously.</li> <li><strong>The right to disconnect:</strong> We trust you to manage your own energy and well-being. Disconnecting from work is not just a right, but a responsibility to be able to contribute sustainably over time.</li></ul>",1);function l(o){var e=i();n(14),r(o,e)}export{l as default};
