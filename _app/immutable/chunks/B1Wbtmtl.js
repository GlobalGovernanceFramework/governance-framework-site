The protocol is named for the hearthstone, the foundation of a home, symbolizing the goal of returning the foundational assets of a community to the heart of the community itself. Its purpose is to provide a voluntary, orderly, and economically viable pathway for companies to divest from harmful operations and for communities to reclaim stewardship of their lands and resources.</p> <h4><strong>4.2 The Stewardship Trust: A New Model of “Ownership”</strong></h4> <p>The legal heart of the Hearthstone Protocol is the <strong>Stewardship Trust</strong>. This is an internationally recognized legal entity designed to hold title to assets like mines, drilling sites, and their surrounding land, replacing traditional private ownership.</p> <p>The key difference lies in its governance and purpose. Unlike a corporation governed for profit, a Stewardship Trust is governed by a multi-stakeholder board according to a legally binding charter with a clear regenerative mandate. This board typically includes:</p> <ul><li>Representatives from the local Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) or community council.</li> <li>Delegates from local worker cooperatives, including former industry employees.</li> <li>Ecological experts and Guardians nominated under the More-Than-Human Governance Framework.</li></ul> <p>The Trust’s primary legal duty is not to its shareholders, but to the long-term health of the community and ecosystem it holds in trust.</p> <h4><strong>4.3 Funding the Just Transition: The Extractive Industry Transition Tax</strong></h4> <p>To finance this profound shift, the Hearthstone Protocol institutes an <strong>Extractive Industry Transition Tax</strong>. This is a levy on the ongoing profits of still-operating, GGF-certified extractive industries. It functions as a form of “reparations-in-advance,” ensuring that the wealth generated from the final stages of the extractive economy is used to build the regenerative economy that will replace it.</p> <p>Revenue from this tax is channeled through the <strong>Global Commons Fund</strong> and is specifically allocated to:</p> <ol><li><strong>Decommissioning and Restoration:</strong> Safely closing and cleaning up legacy sites, such as abandoned mines or oil wells.</li> <li><strong>Ecological Healing:</strong> Funding large-scale, long-term ecosystem restoration projects on land previously damaged by extraction.</li> <li><strong>Community & Worker Support:</strong> Providing a robust social safety net, retraining programs, and seed funding for new, regenerative enterprises for the workers and communities historically dependent on the extractive industry, in direct coordination with the <strong>Work in Liberation Framework</strong>.</li></ol> <h4><strong>4.4 Case Study: The Silesian Stewardship Trust and the “Coal-to-Commons” Project</strong></h4> <ul><li><strong>The Situation:</strong> A multinational coal mining corporation in the historically industrial Silesia region of Poland faces dwindling profits and overwhelming, legally mandated costs for environmental cleanup and worker pensions. Traditional bankruptcy would mean abandoning the toxic sites and devastating the local communities.</li> <li><strong>The Hearthstone Pathway:</strong> The corporation engages with the GGF’s <strong>Office of Commons Transition</strong> and local community councils to utilize the Hearthstone Protocol.</li> <li><strong>The Transition:</strong> The titles to the mines and surrounding degraded lands are voluntarily transferred into the newly formed “Silesian Stewardship Trust.” In exchange, the corporation receives a combination of relief from its long-term environmental liabilities and GGF-backed <strong>Commons Conversion Bonds</strong>.</li> <li><strong>The Outcome:</strong> The new Trust is co-governed by a board of former miners, local municipal leaders, and ecologists from nearby universities. Using funds from the Extractive Industry Transition Tax, the Trust initiates a multi-decade “Coal-to-Commons” project. <ul><li>Former miners are retrained and employed in high-paying jobs safely decommissioning the old mines and restoring the landscape.</li> <li>The restored land is used to develop new, community-owned enterprises: vast solar farms on reclaimed flatlands, regenerative agriculture, and an eco-tourism industry centered on the region’s industrial heritage and renewed nature.</li> <li>The community transitions from a dependent, single-industry economy to a diversified, resilient, and locally-owned regenerative economy.</li></ul></li></ul> <p>This third pillar ensures that the GGF provides not only a shield against future harm but also a clear and hopeful pathway for healing the wounds of the past.</p> <hr>",1);function d(e){var t=r();i(32),n(e,t)}export{d as default};
