This genetic scripture contains the accumulated wisdom of countless generations: how to heal, how to adapt, how to thrive in partnership with the web of life.</p> <p>For millennia, human communities have been careful readers of this sacred text, learning from the plants that heal, the microbes that nourish soil, the intricate relationships that sustain ecosystems. Indigenous knowledge keepers became master interpreters, developing sophisticated biotechnologies through patient observation and respectful partnership with living systems.</p> <p>Now, humanity has learned to write new verses in life’s code itself. We can edit genes, engineer organisms, and craft biological solutions to challenges our ancestors could not have imagined. This power to rewrite the instructions of life is perhaps the most profound capability our species has ever possessed.</p> <p>But who holds the pen matters. When genetic heritage becomes corporate property, when traditional knowledge is appropriated without consent, when communities have no voice in biotechnology affecting their survival—then we become not partners with life, but its colonizers.</p> <p>Let our biotechnology governance learn from the wisdom already written in life’s code: that resilience comes through diversity, that health emerges from relationship, that true innovation serves the flourishing of the whole ecosystem, not the dominance of any single part.</p> <p>Let us become careful scribes in the ongoing story of life, writing new chapters that honor the ancient wisdom while healing the damage done by those who forgot that we are part of the text we seek to edit.</p> <p>Let biotechnology become what it was always meant to be: humanity’s contribution to the collaborative authorship of life’s unfolding story.</p>",1);function m(e){var t=s();n(14),i(e,t)}export{m as default,a as metadata};
