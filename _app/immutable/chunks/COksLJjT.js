Operating through the institutional mechanisms of the <a href="/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home">Treaty for Our Only Home</a>, guided by Indigenous economic principles from the <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge">Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework</a>, and coordinated through the <a href="/frameworks/meta-governance">Integrated Meta-Governance Framework</a>, this financing approach redistributes wealth from extractive corporations and high-emission nations to Indigenous communities and frontline populations leading planetary restoration.</p> <h2><a id="revolutionary-financing-architecture"></a>Revolutionary Financing Architecture</h2> <h3>From Corporate Extraction to Community Control</h3> <p>The financing framework transforms economic relationships from corporate profit extraction to community-controlled resource flows:</p> <p><strong>Indigenous Economic Sovereignty</strong>: Financing systems operate through Indigenous economic principles including reciprocity, seven-generation thinking, and <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#key-mechanisms">Gross Planetary Health (GPH)</a> rather than imposed Western economic models prioritizing profit maximization.</p> <p><strong>Community Ownership Priority</strong>: All climate and energy investments prioritize community ownership and control, ensuring resources serve local needs and cultural values rather than distant corporate shareholders.</p> <p><strong>Reparations-Based Resource Flow</strong>: Climate financing recognizes historical responsibility for climate damages, with high-emission nations and fossil fuel corporations providing reparations to Indigenous communities and frontline populations rather than extractive loans.</p> <p><strong>Rights of Nature Economic Integration</strong>: Economic systems recognize <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#core-principles">Rights of Nature</a>, with ecosystem health and regeneration serving as foundational economic indicators rather than externalized costs.</p> <h3>Treaty-Enabled Financing Authority</h3> <p><strong>Global Carbon Levy Implementation</strong> (enabled by <a href="/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars">Treaty Pillar 4</a>): Carbon taxation with escalating rates making fossil fuels economically unviable while generating $200+ billion annually for Indigenous-led restoration and community adaptation.</p> <p><strong>Financial Transaction Tax for Climate Justice</strong>: 0.1% tax on high-frequency financial transactions generating $150+ billion annually for climate reparations and Indigenous technology sovereignty.</p> <p><strong>Fossil Fuel Subsidy Elimination</strong>: $5.9 trillion in annual fossil fuel subsidies redirected to

Enforcement Mechanism</a> authority to seize corporate assets from climate criminals and transfer ownership to affected communities and ecosystems.</p> <h3>Meta-Governance Financial Coordination</h3> <p><strong>Cross-Domain Resource Integration</strong>: Climate finance coordinated with health, food, economic, and security governance through the <a href="/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components">Climate & Energy Meta-Council</a> to prevent contradictory resource allocation and ensure holistic community support.</p> <p><strong>Crisis Response Finance</strong>: <a href="/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components">24-hour emergency protocols</a> enable immediate resource mobilization during climate disasters while maintaining community control over emergency resource allocation.</p> <p><strong>Evaluation-Based Resource Adjustment</strong>: <a href="/frameworks/meta-governance#evaluation">7-Dimension Assessment</a> guides resource allocation, ensuring finance serves community needs, cultural integrity, and ecosystem health rather than bureaucratic or corporate interests.</p> <h2><a
