This framework serves as the organizational infrastructure for <strong>Work With Purpose</strong>, channeling AUBI’s economic security into meaningful contributions guided by Indigenous wisdom and Treaty-aligned governance.</p> <h2><a id="overview"></a>Overview</h2> <p><strong>Framework Position</strong>: The Work in Liberation Framework serves as the <strong>organizational and coordination engine</strong> for meaningful work within the broader <a href="/frameworks/meta-governance">Global Governance Framework ecosystem</a>. It builds directly on the economic foundation provided by the <a href="/frameworks/aubi">AUBI Framework</a>, organizing the contributions enabled by economic security into Community Work Teams guided by Indigenous sovereignty through <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge">Bioregional Autonomous Zones</a>. While AUBI provides freedom from survival anxiety, Work in Liberation transforms that freedom into purposeful action for planetary and community healing.</p> <p>This framework presents a <strong>revolutionary alternative to extractive labor systems</strong>, moving beyond reform to fundamental transformation of how humans organize productive activity. It integrates <a href="/frameworks/financial-systems">Hearts and Leaves currencies</a> for recognizing care and ecological work, operates through Community Work Teams under Indigenous-led governance, and coordinates globally through the Fractal Labor Parliament as a Meta-Governance Coordination Council. Aligned with the <a href="/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home">Treaty for Our Only Home</a>’s Ecocide enforcement and guided by Traditional Ecological Knowledge, it ensures work serves life rather than exploiting it.</p> <h3>Vision: A Day in the Life, 2045</h3> <p>Picture this: In 2045, in a Tanzanian <strong>Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ)</strong>, you wake secure knowing your <strong>AUBI Layer 1</strong> provides unconditional income (70% fiat/$840, 30% Hearts/$360 monthly), freeing you from survival worries. Through the <strong>Community Work App</strong>, you join a watershed restoration team under Indigenous-led BAZ governance, earning <strong>AUBI Layer 2 Bonuses</strong> in Hearts for mentoring youth (20% boost) and Leaves for ecological work (adjusted by your Green Job Score). Your contributions are logged in the <strong>Love Ledger</strong>, building community wealth while restoring ecosystems.</p> <p>Your <strong>Flexible Time</strong> schedule (15-hour weekly cap) respects cultural rhythms and seasonal cycles, leaving abundant time for family, creativity, and spiritual practice. At evening <strong>Community Renewal</strong> ceremonies, elders and youth validate your team’s ecological contributions, guided by global principles from the <strong>Fractal Labor Parliament</strong> but adapted to local Indigenous protocols. <strong>Work With Purpose</strong>—focused on care, creativity, and planetary health—has replaced extractive employment, supported by <strong>Technology That Helps</strong> rather than surveils, all coordinated through Indigenous wisdom and Treaty-aligned governance.</p> <p>By 2045, 50% of people live this way globally, with 30% of all jobs actively regenerating ecosystems, sustained by adaptive governance that combines ancient wisdom with contemporary coordination needs.</p> <p><strong>2050 Commitment</strong>: 80% participation in Work With Purpose, complete elimination of extractive gig platforms, and 40% of global land under regenerative stewardship through Community Work Teams.</p> <h3>Key Features</h3> <p><strong>Community Work Teams</strong>: Self-organizing groups coordinated through Indigenous-led BAZ governance, replacing gig platforms with democratic, community-controlled work organization that serves local needs and global healing.</p> <p><strong>Fractal Labor Parliament (FLP)</strong>: Global coordination council operating under Meta-Governance principles, setting universal standards for contribution recognition while ensuring BAZ-level adaptation respects cultural sovereignty and traditional governance.</p> <p><strong>Hearts and Leaves Integration</strong>: Meaningful work rewarded through complementary currencies—Hearts for care and social contributions, Leaves for ecological restoration—logged in the Love Ledger and distributed through AUBI Layer 2/3 bonuses.</p> <p><strong>Flexible Time and Accessibility</strong>: Universal 15-hour weekly maximum by 2035, with neurodiversity support, cultural rhythm accommodation, and seasonal cycle alignment ensuring work serves human flourishing rather than demanding sacrifice.</p> <p><strong>Indigenous Leadership and Cultural Integration</strong>: All work organization guided by BAZ councils under Earth Council authority, ensuring Traditional Ecological Knowledge leads ecological work and Indigenous sovereignty guides governance innovation.</p> <p><strong>Industrial Sunsetting with Just Transition</strong>: Systematic phase-out of extractive industries (fossil fuels by 2035, fast fashion by 2038) under Treaty Ecocide law, with comprehensive support for workers transitioning to regenerative alternatives.</p> <p><strong>Technology That Serves</strong>: AI and digital tools designed to enhance rather than replace human creativity and connection, with community control over workplace technology and protection from algorithmic exploitation.</p> <h2><a id="framework-sections"></a>Framework Sections</h2> <p>The framework integrates ancient wisdom with contemporary coordination needs through ten interconnected sections:</p> <h3><strong><a href="/frameworks/work-in-liberation#introduction">Introduction: Organizing Work With Purpose</a></strong></h3> <p><em>“Work is not separate from life—it is life expressing itself through service to the whole.”</em><br> Framework origins, AUBI integration, and the transformation from survival work to meaningful contribution.</p> <h3><strong><a href="/frameworks/work-in-liberation#core-principles">Core Principles</a></strong></h3> <p><em>“The Earth does not belong to us—we belong to the Earth, and our work must serve this relationship.”</em><br> Five foundational principles: Work as Planetary Contribution, Freedom from Survival Work, Fair Plural Rewards, Human-AI Symbiosis, and Ecological/Social Justice.</p> <h3><strong><a href="/frameworks/work-in-liberation#core-components">Core Components</a></strong></h3> <p><em>“When spider webs unite, they can tie up a lion.”</em><br> Fractal Labor Parliament, Community Work Teams, Flexible Work Agreements, Fair Pay Systems, and Dispute Resolution mechanisms.</p> <h3><strong><a href="/frameworks/work-in-liberation#implementation-plan">25-Year Implementation Plan</a></strong></h3> <p><em>“The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago.
