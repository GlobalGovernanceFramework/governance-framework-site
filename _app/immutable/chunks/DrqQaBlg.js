It is not an analogy for other things we want to do to improve our societies and schools. It is not a verb, a fantasy, or a procedure. Decolonization specifically requires the repatriation of Indigenous land and life.”</em> — Eve Tuck and K. Wayne Yang</p> <p><em>“But decolonization also asks us to dream beyond what we know, to imagine and create new ways of being in relationship that honor Indigenous sovereignty while transforming the systems that perpetuate harm to all life.”</em> — Leanne Betasamosake Simpson</p> <p>The journey toward regenerative enterprise cannot be separated from the work of decolonization. The extractive economic systems we seek to transform were built through the colonization of Indigenous lands and the suppression of Indigenous knowledge systems that understood business as relationship with the living world rather than domination over it.</p> <p>This work requires profound humility. It asks non-Indigenous enterprises to recognize that Indigenous communities have been practicing regenerative economics for millennia, and that any authentic transformation must be guided by Indigenous wisdom and leadership. It demands that we move beyond consultation and charity toward genuine partnership and reparative justice.</p> <p><strong>In this exploration:</strong></p> <ul><li><a href="#fpic-co-creation">From Consultation to Co-Creation: The Spirit of FPIC 2.0</a></li> <li><a href="#truth-reconciliation">On Truth, Healing, and Reconciliation: A Path for Enterprises</a></li> <li><a href="#land-back-partnership">Supporting Land Back: A Guide to Being a Good Partner</a></li></ul> <hr> <h2><a id="fpic-co-creation"></a>From Consultation to Co-Creation: The Spirit of FPIC 2.0</h2> <p>Free, Prior, and Informed Consent (FPIC) has long been recognized as a minimum standard for engaging with Indigenous communities. However, true decolonization requires moving beyond the limitations of traditional FPIC toward what Indigenous leaders are calling FPIC 2.0—an approach rooted in co-creation, ongoing relationship, and genuine shared authority rather than one-time consultation and consent.</p> <p><strong>Understanding the Limitations of Traditional FPIC</strong></p> <p>Traditional FPIC processes often treat consent as a transaction—a one-time agreement that allows projects to proceed without ongoing accountability to Indigenous communities. This approach can inadvertently perpetuate colonial patterns by reducing complex, ongoing relationships to contractual agreements and treating Indigenous knowledge as a resource to be consulted rather than wisdom to guide transformation.</p> <p><strong>The Vision of FPIC 2.0</strong></p> <p>FPIC 2.0 recognizes that authentic engagement with Indigenous communities requires fundamental shifts in how non-Indigenous enterprises approach relationship, authority, and accountability.</p> <p><strong>From Consultation to Co-Creation:</strong> Instead of consulting Indigenous communities about predetermined plans, FPIC 2.0 invites Indigenous leadership into the design and ongoing governance of enterprises that affect Indigenous territories, knowledge, or communities.</p> <p><strong>From Consent to Ongoing Relationship:</strong> Rather than seeking one-time consent for specific projects, FPIC 2.0 establishes ongoing relationships of mutual accountability that evolve over time as understanding deepens and circumstances change.</p> <p><strong>From Information Sharing to Wisdom Partnership:</strong> Instead of providing information to Indigenous communities for their evaluation, FPIC 2.0 recognizes Indigenous knowledge systems as essential wisdom that can guide enterprises toward authentic regeneration.</p> <p><strong>Stories of FPIC 2.0 in Practice</strong></p> <p><strong>The Pacific Northwest Watershed Restoration Partnership:</strong></p> <p>To illustrate how FPIC 2.0 principles might guide enterprise-Indigenous relationships, consider the story of a renewable energy enterprise working in the Pacific Northwest, where salmon runs and forest ecosystems are sacred to multiple Indigenous nations.</p> <p>Rather than developing renewable energy projects and then seeking Indigenous consent, the enterprise began by approaching tribal councils with a different question: “How might renewable energy development serve the restoration of salmon runs and forest health that you have been working toward?”</p> <p><strong>The Co-Creation Process:</strong></p> <p><strong>Indigenous Leadership in Design:</strong> Tribal environmental scientists and cultural knowledge keepers led the design of renewable energy systems that would enhance rather than disrupt salmon habitat and migration patterns.</p> <p><strong>Shared Governance Structure:</strong> The enterprise governance structure included permanent seats for tribal representatives with equal authority to other board members, ensuring ongoing Indigenous leadership rather than advisory input.</p> <p><strong>Knowledge Integration:</strong> Traditional ecological knowledge about seasonal energy patterns, wildlife behavior, and ecosystem relationships informed the technical design of renewable energy systems in ways that created better outcomes for both energy production and ecosystem health.</p> <p><strong>Economic Benefit Sharing:</strong> Revenue sharing agreements ensured that renewable energy development contributed to tribal economic sovereignty rather than extracting wealth from Indigenous territories.</p> <p><strong>Cultural Protocol Integration:</strong> All enterprise activities followed cultural protocols developed by tribal communities, including seasonal restrictions during salmon runs and ceremonial acknowledgment of the land and water relationships that make energy production possible.</p> <p>“What we discovered was that when Indigenous knowledge guides the design from the beginning, we create solutions that serve everyone better,” reflects enterprise coordinator Jennifer Martinez. “The renewable energy systems worked more effectively because they were designed in relationship with the ecosystem rather than imposed upon it.”</p> <p><strong>The Ongoing Relationship Commitment:</strong></p> <p>The partnership included mechanisms for ongoing consent rather than one-time approval:</p> <p><strong>Annual Relationship Renewal:</strong> Each year, tribal councils review the partnership and can modify or withdraw consent based on how the relationship is serving tribal priorities and ecosystem health.</p> <p><strong>Cultural Impact Monitoring:</strong> Tribal cultural practitioners regularly assess how enterprise activities affect sacred sites, traditional practices, and cultural transmission to younger generations.</p> <p><strong>Adaptive Management:</strong> The partnership agreement includes processes for adapting operations based on new understanding, changing ecological conditions, or evolving tribal priorities.</p> <p><strong>Conflict Resolution:</strong> Disagreements are addressed through traditional tribal conflict resolution processes led by Indigenous mediators rather than Western legal frameworks.</p> <p><strong>Principles for Authentic Co-Creation</strong></p> <p><strong>Indigenous Authority:</strong></p> <p>Authentic co-creation requires recognizing Indigenous communities’ inherent sovereignty and right to determine how their territories, knowledge, and communities are affected by enterprise activities.</p> <p>This means:</p> <ul><li><strong>Veto power</strong> over any activities affecting Indigenous territories or knowledge</li> <li><strong>Leadership roles</strong> in governance structures with real decision-making authority</li> <li><strong>Cultural protocol authority</strong> to determine appropriate ways of engaging with traditional knowledge and sacred sites</li> <li><strong>Self-determination support</strong> through enterprise activities that advance Indigenous priorities rather than imposing external agendas</li></ul> <p><strong>Reciprocal Relationship:</strong></p> <p>Co-creation is based on reciprocity rather than extraction. Non-Indigenous enterprises must offer genuine value to Indigenous communities rather than simply seeking access to land, knowledge, or consent.</p> <p>Examples of reciprocal offerings:</p> <ul><li><strong>Technical resources</strong> that support Indigenous environmental restoration and cultural revitalization priorities</li> <li><strong>Economic partnership</strong> that builds Indigenous economic sovereignty rather than dependence</li> <li><strong>Political support</strong> for Indigenous rights and self-determination in policy and legal contexts</li> <li><strong>Cultural respect</strong> demonstrated through learning and following Indigenous protocols rather than appropriating traditional knowledge</li></ul> <p><strong>Cultural Translation and Protection:</strong></p> <p>FPIC 2.0 includes robust protections for Indigenous knowledge and cultural practices, ensuring that co-creation doesn’t become a form of cultural appropriation or knowledge theft.</p> <p><strong>Knowledge Sovereignty:</strong> Indigenous communities maintain complete control over traditional knowledge, determining what can be shared, how it can be used, and what must remain protected.</p> <p><strong>Cultural Translation Standards:</strong> When traditional knowledge informs enterprise practices, Indigenous knowledge keepers lead the process of determining appropriate ways to integrate that wisdom while protecting its sacred dimensions.</p> <p><strong>Attribution and Compensation:</strong> Any use of Indigenous knowledge includes appropriate attribution and compensation determined by Indigenous communities rather than external standards.</p> <p><strong>Benefit Return:</strong> Enterprises that benefit from Indigenous knowledge and territories must ensure that benefits flow back to Indigenous communities in ways that strengthen rather than undermine cultural integrity and self-determination.</p> <p><strong>The Regional Food Sovereignty Network:</strong></p> <p>Another illustration of FPIC 2.0 principles comes from a network of food enterprises working to support Indigenous food sovereignty across multiple tribal territories.</p> <p>Rather than developing Indigenous-themed products or appropriating traditional foods for commercial markets, these enterprises began by asking: “How can our work support Indigenous communities’ efforts to restore traditional food systems and achieve food sovereignty?”</p> <p><strong>The Co-Creative Approach:</strong></p> <p><strong>Indigenous-Led Design:</strong> Tribal food sovereignty coordinators led the development of enterprise networks that supported traditional food production, processing, and distribution according to cultural protocols and community priorities.</p> <p><strong>Seed Sovereignty Support:</strong> Enterprises focused on supporting Indigenous seed saving and traditional crop restoration rather than commercializing Indigenous varieties.</p> <p><strong>Market Access Without Appropriation:</strong> Non-Indigenous enterprises created market access for Indigenous food producers while ensuring that Indigenous communities maintained control over their food products and cultural narratives.</p> <p><strong>Knowledge Protection:</strong> Traditional food knowledge remained under Indigenous control, with enterprises supporting traditional learning and cultural transmission rather than extracting knowledge for commercial use.</p> <p><strong>Land Access Support:</strong> Enterprise networks purchased land to return to tribal ownership and supported traditional land management practices rather than industrial agriculture.</p> <p>“The key was understanding that food sovereignty isn’t just about producing food—it’s about Indigenous communities controlling their own food systems according to their cultural values and traditional knowledge,” explains network coordinator Maria Santos. “Our role was to provide support without interference or appropriation.”</p> <p><strong>Challenges and Honest Conversations</strong></p> <p><strong>The Time and Relationship Investment:</strong></p> <p>Authentic co-creation requires significant investment in relationship-building and cultural learning that may slow down enterprise development timelines. This investment is essential for authentic engagement but requires enterprises to prioritize relationship over rapid implementation.</p> <p><strong>The Complexity of Multiple Sovereignties:</strong></p> <p>When enterprises work across multiple Indigenous territories, they must navigate different tribal governments, cultural protocols, and priorities without imposing uniformity or creating competition between Indigenous communities.</p> <p><strong>The Ongoing Learning Requirement:</strong></p> <p>FPIC 2.0 requires non-Indigenous enterprise leaders to engage in ongoing education about Indigenous history, current realities, and cultural protocols. This learning must be approached with humility and understanding that it is a lifelong commitment rather than a box to check.</p> <p><strong>Questions for Reflection:</strong></p> <ul><li>How might your enterprise move beyond consultation toward genuine co-creation with Indigenous communities?</li> <li>What knowledge, resources, and authority could you share to support Indigenous self-determination?</li> <li>How might Indigenous wisdom transform your understanding of what regenerative enterprise could become?</li> <li>What ongoing learning and relationship commitments would authentic partnership require?</li></ul> <hr> <h2><a id="truth-reconciliation"></a>On Truth, Healing, and Reconciliation: A Path for Enterprises</h2> <p>For many enterprises, especially those with histories of extractive operations or those operating in industries built on colonization and exploitation, the journey toward regeneration requires honest reckoning with past and ongoing harms. This process of truth-telling, healing, and reconciliation offers a pathway for enterprises to transform their relationship with affected communities while contributing to broader societal healing.</p> <p><strong>Understanding Truth and Reconciliation as Transformation</strong></p> <p>Truth and reconciliation processes recognize that authentic transformation requires acknowledging and addressing historical harms rather than simply implementing new policies. For enterprises, this means honestly examining how their operations have affected Indigenous communities, workers, local ecosystems, and other stakeholders, and taking responsibility for repair and relationship restoration.</p> <p><strong>The Difference Between Apology and Accountability</strong></p> <p>Many enterprises approach historical harms through public apologies or charitable giving that acknowledge wrongdoing without fundamentally changing the relationships and structures that created harm. Truth and reconciliation requires deeper transformation—changes in governance, operations, and resource distribution that demonstrate authentic commitment to repair and prevention of future harm.</p> <p><strong>A Story of Corporate Truth and Reconciliation</strong></p> <p><strong>The Mining Company’s Journey Toward Accountability:</strong></p> <p>To illustrate how truth and reconciliation might guide enterprise transformation, consider the journey of a mining company working to address its legacy of environmental destruction and Indigenous rights violations.</p> <p>For decades, the company had operated mines on Indigenous territories without meaningful consent, created environmental damage that affected traditional hunting and gathering, and employed labor practices that exploited both Indigenous and non-Indigenous workers. When new leadership committed to regenerative transformation, they recognized that this history required more than policy changes—it demanded truth-telling and repair.</p> <p><strong>Phase 1: Truth-Seeking and Acknowledgment</strong></p> <p><strong>Community-Led Investigation:</strong> Rather than conducting an internal review, the company supported an independent investigation led by affected Indigenous communities and worker organizations. This investigation documented specific harms, including environmental contamination, cultural disruption, and economic exploitation.</p> <p><strong>Public Truth-Telling:</strong> The company participated in public hearings where community members shared their experiences of harm, and company representatives listened without defending or minimizing the impacts described.</p> <p><strong>Historical Accountability:</strong> Company leadership publicly acknowledged the specific harms caused by company operations, including environmental destruction, violations of Indigenous rights, and exploitation of workers.</p> <p><strong>Systemic Analysis:</strong> The investigation examined not just individual incidents but the systemic practices and policies that enabled ongoing harm, including governance structures that excluded affected voices and operational procedures that prioritized profit over community wellbeing.</p> <p><strong>Phase 2: Repair and Restoration</strong></p> <p><strong>Environmental Restoration Fund:</strong> The company established a fund representing 25% of annual profits for ecosystem restoration, with project design and implementation led by Indigenous communities and environmental justice organizations.</p> <p><strong>Land Return and Co-Management:</strong> Where possible, the company returned land to Indigenous ownership and established co-management agreements for remaining operations that gave Indigenous communities authority over environmental and cultural protection.</p> <p><strong>Worker Justice Fund:</strong> A separate fund provided compensation for workers harmed by unsafe conditions and supported worker cooperative development in affected communities.</p> <p><strong>Cultural Revitalization Support:</strong> Company resources supported Indigenous language preservation, traditional ecological knowledge transmission, and cultural practices that had been disrupted by mining operations.</p> <p><strong>Economic Reparations:</strong> Revenue sharing agreements ensured ongoing compensation to affected communities, with distribution determined by community-controlled processes rather than company discretion.</p> <p><strong>Phase 3: Structural Transformation</strong></p> <p><strong>Governance Revolution:</strong> The company restructured its board to include permanent seats for Indigenous representatives and affected community members with equal authority to other board members.</p> <p><strong>Operational Protocols:</strong> All mining operations now follow cultural and environmental protocols developed by Indigenous communities, including seasonal restrictions and sacred site protection.</p> <p><strong>Just Transition Planning:</strong> The company committed to phasing out extraction while supporting economic diversification in affected regions, with transition plans developed by communities rather than imposed by the company.</p> <p><strong>Transparency and Accountability:</strong> Regular public reporting on environmental restoration, community relationships, and implementation of reconciliation commitments, with community-controlled auditing processes.</p> <p>“The truth and reconciliation process was more difficult and transformative than we expected,” reflects company CEO David Thompson. “We discovered that accountability required fundamental changes in how we understand our responsibilities and relationships, not just modifications to existing practices.”</p> <p><strong>The Ongoing Commitment:</strong></p> <p><strong>Annual Reconciliation Reviews:</strong> Each year, affected communities assess the company’s progress on reconciliation commitments and can modify agreements based on changing needs and circumstances.</p> <p><strong>Intergenerational Accountability:</strong> The reconciliation agreement includes provisions for engaging with younger generations who will inherit both the benefits and ongoing impacts of company operations.</p> <p><strong>Conflict Prevention:</strong> New decision-making processes require community consent for any operational changes, preventing future harms rather than simply responding to them after they occur.</p> <p><strong>Movement Building:</strong> The company shares its reconciliation model with other extractive enterprises and advocates for industry-wide adoption of truth and reconciliation approaches.</p> <p><strong>Principles for Enterprise Truth and Reconciliation</strong></p> <p><strong>Community-Led Processes:</strong></p> <p>Authentic truth and reconciliation must be led by affected communities rather than controlled by enterprises. This means:</p> <ul><li><strong>Community authority</strong> over the design and implementation of truth-seeking processes</li> <li><strong>Culturally appropriate methods</strong> for truth-telling and healing determined by affected communities</li> <li><strong>Community-controlled resources</strong> for investigation, documentation, and repair activities</li> <li><strong>Indigenous sovereignty</strong> over processes affecting Indigenous communities</li></ul> <p><strong>Comprehensive Truth-Seeking:</strong></p> <p>Truth and reconciliation requires examining the full scope of harm rather than focusing on isolated incidents or obvious violations. This includes:</p> <ul><li><strong>Historical analysis</strong> of how enterprise operations have affected communities and ecosystems over time</li> <li><strong>Systemic examination</strong> of policies and structures that enabled or perpetuated harm</li> <li><strong>Ongoing impact assessment</strong> of how historical harms continue to affect communities</li> <li><strong>Root cause analysis</strong> of the economic and political systems that incentivized harmful practices</li></ul> <p><strong>Meaningful Repair:</strong></p> <p>Reconciliation requires concrete actions that address harm rather than symbolic gestures or financial payments that don’t change underlying relationships. This includes:</p> <ul><li><strong>Structural transformation</strong> of governance, operations, and resource distribution</li> <li><strong>Community-controlled compensation</strong> determined by affected communities rather than enterprise discretion</li> <li><strong>Restoration activities</strong> that heal environmental and cultural damage</li> <li><strong>Prevention mechanisms</strong> that ensure harmful practices don’t continue</li></ul> <p><strong>Ongoing Accountability:</strong></p> <p>Truth and reconciliation is not a one-time process but an ongoing commitment to transformed relationships. This requires:</p> <ul><li><strong>Regular review</strong> of reconciliation commitments with community feedback and modification</li> <li><strong>Transparent reporting</strong> on progress, challenges, and changing circumstances</li> <li><strong>Conflict resolution</strong> mechanisms that address new disagreements or concerns</li> <li><strong>Intergenerational engagement</strong> that includes younger community members in ongoing accountability</li></ul> <p><strong>The Textile Industry Truth and Reconciliation Network:</strong></p> <p>Another example of collective truth and reconciliation comes from a network of textile companies addressing their industry’s history of labor exploitation and environmental damage in Global South communities.</p> <p><strong>Collective Accountability:</strong> Rather than addressing harms individually, companies collaborated in a shared truth and reconciliation process that examined industry-wide patterns of exploitation and developed collective repair strategies.</p> <p><strong>Worker-Led Investigation:</strong> Current and former textile workers led investigations into labor conditions, wage theft, environmental health impacts, and community disruption caused by textile production.</p> <p><strong>Community Restoration Fund:</strong> Companies contributed to a worker-controlled fund for community development, environmental cleanup, and worker cooperative development in affected regions.</p> <p><strong>Industry Transformation:</strong> The process led to industry-wide changes in labor standards, environmental practices, and supply chain relationships, with ongoing worker oversight of implementation.</p> <p>“Individual company reconciliation wasn’t enough because the harms were systemic,” explains worker organizer Rosa Martinez. “We needed collective acknowledgment and collective transformation to address the scale of harm and create meaningful change.”</p> <p><strong>Challenges and Honest Reflections</strong></p> <p><strong>The Limitation of Enterprise-Led Reconciliation:</strong></p> <p>Enterprise truth and reconciliation processes, no matter how well-intentioned, cannot address systemic harms that require broader political and economic transformation. They must be understood as contributions to larger movements for justice rather than complete solutions.</p> <p><strong>The Risk of Reconciliation Without Justice:</strong></p> <p>Truth and reconciliation can be co-opted to create appearance of accountability without meaningful change. Authentic processes require transfer of real power and resources to affected communities, not just acknowledgment of harm.</p> <p><strong>The Ongoing Nature of the Work:</strong></p> <p>Truth and reconciliation is not a process that enterprises complete and move beyond. It requires ongoing commitment to transformed relationships and continued accountability to affected communities.</p> <p><strong>Questions for Reflection:</strong></p> <ul><li>What histories of harm might your enterprise or industry need to acknowledge and address?</li> <li>How might affected communities lead truth-seeking and reconciliation processes in your context?</li> <li>What structural transformations would demonstrate authentic commitment to repair and prevention of future harm?</li> <li>How might your reconciliation work contribute to broader movements for justice and systemic change?</li></ul> <hr> <h2><a id="land-back-partnership"></a>Supporting Land Back: A Guide to Being a Good Partner</h2> <p>The Land Back movement represents Indigenous communities’ assertion of their inherent sovereignty over ancestral territories and their right to determine how those territories are used, protected, and governed. For enterprises operating on Indigenous territories—which includes virtually all land in the Americas, Australia, and many other regions—understanding how to support Land Back represents a fundamental aspect of regenerative transformation.</p> <p><strong>Understanding Land Back as Justice, Not Charity</strong></p> <p>Land Back is not a request for charitable support but an assertion of Indigenous sovereignty and a pathway toward justice for centuries of colonization and land theft. For enterprises, supporting Land Back means recognizing Indigenous nations’ inherent rights to their territories and finding ways to align business operations with Indigenous sovereignty rather than continuing colonial patterns of extraction and occupation.</p> <p><strong>The Multiple Dimensions of Land Back</strong></p> <p><strong>Physical Land Return:</strong> Returning ownership and control of land to Indigenous communities, including purchase and transfer of private property, support for federal land transfers, and recognition of traditional territory boundaries.</p> <p><strong>Resource Sovereignty:</strong> Recognizing Indigenous authority over natural resources including water, minerals, forests, and wildlife within traditional territories.</p> <p><strong>Governance Authority:</strong> Supporting Indigenous communities’ rights to govern their territories according to traditional law and contemporary Indigenous governance systems.</p> <p><strong>Cultural Restoration:</strong> Supporting restoration of traditional ecological knowledge, cultural practices, and spiritual relationships with land that colonization disrupted.</p> <p><strong>Economic Sovereignty:</strong> Ensuring that economic development on Indigenous territories is controlled by and benefits Indigenous communities rather than external interests.</p> <p><strong>Stories of Enterprise Partnership with Land Back</strong></p> <p><strong>The Renewable Energy Land Return Partnership:</strong></p> <p>To illustrate how enterprises might authentically support Land Back, consider the story of a renewable energy company that discovered their wind farm development was planned for land that had been stolen from Indigenous communities through fraudulent treaty negotiations.</p> <p>Rather than proceeding with development or offering financial compensation, the company chose a different path that aligned their business with Land Back goals.</p> <p><strong>The Partnership Process:</strong></p> <p><strong>Recognition and Research:</strong> The company supported tribal historians and legal advocates in researching and documenting the original theft of tribal lands, providing resources for legal research while recognizing tribal authority over the investigation.</p> <p><strong>Land Purchase and Return:</strong> Using company capital, they purchased land that had been identified as priority territory for return to tribal ownership, transferring ownership to the tribal nation without conditions or restrictions.</p> <p><strong>Co-Development Planning:</strong> For renewable energy development that could serve both tribal economic sovereignty and clean energy goals, the tribal nation led planning processes with the company as a technical partner rather than project leader.</p> <p><strong>Shared Infrastructure:</strong> Wind and solar installations were designed as tribal enterprises with the renewable energy company providing technical expertise and equipment while the tribal nation maintained ownership and control.</p> <p><strong>Revenue Sovereignty:</strong> Energy revenue flows to the tribal nation, which determines how resources are used for community priorities including language revitalization, traditional ecological restoration, and economic development.</p> <p>“We realized that supporting Land Back wasn’t incompatible with renewable energy development—it was the only way to do renewable energy development with integrity,” reflects company coordinator Michael Chen. “When Indigenous communities control the projects, they create solutions that serve both sovereignty and environmental healing.”</p> <p><strong>The Forest Restoration Land Back Initiative:</strong></p> <p>Another example comes from a network of timber companies working to support Land Back through forest restoration and carbon sequestration projects.</p> <p><strong>From Extraction to Restoration:</strong> Companies that had previously engaged in clear-cut logging transitioned to supporting Indigenous-led forest restoration that rebuilt traditional forest ecosystems while generating carbon credits.</p> <p><strong>Technical Partnership:</strong> Companies provided forestry equipment, restoration expertise, and carbon market access while Indigenous communities controlled all forest management decisions according to traditional ecological knowledge.</p> <p><strong>Land Acquisition Support:</strong> Timber companies used their capital to purchase forest land for return to tribal ownership, prioritizing territories identified by Indigenous communities as culturally and ecologically significant.</p> <p><strong>Policy Advocacy:</strong> Companies leveraged their political influence to advocate for federal and state policies supporting Land Back and Indigenous forest management rights.</p> <p>“The forests are healthier under Indigenous management than they ever were under industrial timber practices,” notes company forester Sarah Martinez. “Supporting Land Back turned out to be the best business decision we ever made because it aligned our work with ecological processes rather than fighting against them.”</p> <p><strong>Practical Pathways for Land Back Support</strong></p> <p><strong>Land Purchase and Return:</strong></p> <p><strong>Direct Purchase:</strong> Using enterprise capital to purchase land identified by Indigenous communities as priority territory for return, with transfers happening without conditions or restrictions on how Indigenous communities use their land.</p> <p><strong>Conservation Easement Modification:</strong> Where enterprises hold conservation easements on Indigenous territories, modifying or transferring those easements to tribal nations to restore Indigenous governance authority.</p> <p><strong>Development Rights Transfer:</strong> Transferring development rights to Indigenous communities so they can control how their territories are used rather than having land use determined by external property owners.</p> <p><strong>Right of First Refusal:</strong> Establishing legal commitments to offer Indigenous communities first opportunity to purchase land when enterprises sell property on traditional territories.</p> <p><strong>Resource Sovereignty Support:</strong></p> <p><strong>Water Rights Advocacy:</strong> Supporting Indigenous communities’ legal claims to water rights on traditional territories and opposing water extraction projects that violate Indigenous sovereignty.</p> <p><strong>Mineral Rights Research:</strong> Investigating and supporting Indigenous claims to mineral rights on traditional territories, including transfers of existing mineral rights to tribal ownership.</p> <p><strong>Wildlife Management Partnership:</strong> Recognizing Indigenous authority over wildlife management on traditional territories and supporting traditional hunting, fishing, and gathering rights.</p> <p><strong>Sacred Sites Protection:</strong> Identifying and protecting sacred sites from any enterprise development, with protection protocols developed by Indigenous spiritual leaders and cultural practitioners.</p> <p><strong>Economic Sovereignty Building:</strong></p> <p><strong>Procurement Partnerships:</strong> Prioritizing Indigenous-owned suppliers and contractors, with procurement policies that support Indigenous economic development rather than extraction from Indigenous communities.</p> <p><strong>Cooperative Development:</strong> Supporting Indigenous worker cooperatives and community enterprises that build economic sovereignty rather than dependence on external employment.</p> <p><strong>Financial Institution Support:</strong> Supporting Indigenous-controlled financial institutions including credit unions, investment funds, and community development financial institutions.</p> <p><strong>Traditional Economy Integration:</strong> Supporting traditional economic practices including subsistence activities, cultural production, and traditional knowledge-based enterprises.</p> <p><strong>Governance Support:</strong></p> <p><strong>Jurisdiction Recognition:</strong> Recognizing Indigenous governments’ authority over traditional territories and working with tribal governments as sovereign entities rather than stakeholder groups.</p> <p><strong>Legal Advocacy:</strong> Supporting Indigenous communities’ legal efforts to restore governance authority, including treaty rights enforcement and federal recognition processes.</p> <p><strong>Cultural Protocol Integration:</strong> Incorporating Indigenous cultural protocols into enterprise operations, with protocols developed and enforced by Indigenous cultural authorities.</p> <p><strong>Youth Leadership Development:</strong> Supporting Indigenous youth leadership development and cultural transmission programs that strengthen Indigenous governance capacity.</p> <p><strong>The Regional Land Back Consortium:</strong></p> <p>A network of enterprises across the Pacific Northwest has formed a consortium to coordinate Land Back support across bioregional boundaries.</p> <p><strong>Shared Land Acquisition:</strong> Companies pool resources to purchase large-scale territory for return to tribal ownership, enabling land return projects that individual enterprises couldn’t finance.</p> <p><strong>Policy Collaboration:</strong> The consortium coordinates advocacy for state and federal policies supporting Land Back, leveraging collective political influence for Indigenous sovereignty.</p> <p><strong>Knowledge Sharing:</strong> Companies share strategies, resources, and lessons learned about supporting Land Back without appropriating Indigenous knowledge or interfering in tribal sovereignty.</p> <p><strong>Accountability Network:</strong> Regular meetings with tribal leaders provide feedback on consortium activities and ensure that Land Back support serves Indigenous priorities rather than enterprise interests.</p> <p>“Working collectively allows us to support Land Back at the scale that Indigenous communities deserve,” explains consortium coordinator Jennifer Park. “Individual company support was meaningful but limited. Collective support can create real transformation.”</p> <p><strong>Avoiding Harmful Approaches</strong></p> <p><strong>Not Land Acknowledgments Without Action:</strong></p> <p>Land acknowledgments that recognize Indigenous territories without supporting actual Land Back can become forms of settler absolution that make continued occupation seem acceptable. Meaningful land acknowledgment includes commitment to supporting land return.</p> <p><strong>Not Cultural Appropriation as “Partnership”:</strong></p> <p>Using Indigenous symbols, knowledge, or practices for enterprise branding or products is not Land Back support but cultural appropriation that can harm Indigenous communities. Authentic partnership focuses on supporting Indigenous sovereignty rather than benefiting from Indigenous culture.</p> <p><strong>Not Charity Model Relationships:</strong></p> <p>Treating Land Back support as charitable giving rather than justice work perpetuates colonial relationships. Authentic support recognizes Indigenous rights and sovereignty rather than framing land return as generosity.</p> <p><strong>Not Conditional Support:</strong></p> <p>Land Back support that comes with conditions about how Indigenous communities can use their territories continues colonial control patterns. Authentic support includes transferring land without restrictions on Indigenous governance.</p> <p><strong>Questions for Reflection:</strong></p> <ul><li>What Indigenous territories does your enterprise operate on, and what is the history of how those lands were taken from Indigenous communities?</li> <li>How might your enterprise use its resources and influence to support Land Back in ways that serve Indigenous sovereignty rather than enterprise interests?</li> <li>What relationships with Indigenous communities could guide your Land Back support while respecting Indigenous authority and self-determination?</li> <li>How might supporting Land Back transform your understanding of what it means to operate in right relationship with the land and its original peoples?</li></ul> <p><strong>The Sacred Work of Return</strong></p> <p>Supporting Land Back is ultimately about recognizing that the land we all depend on for life has original peoples who never ceded their responsibilities as caretakers and stewards. When enterprises support land return to Indigenous sovereignty, they participate in healing relationships that colonization disrupted while aligning their work with Indigenous knowledge systems that understand business as relationship with the living world.</p> <p>This work requires deep humility, ongoing learning, and commitment to transformation that extends far beyond individual enterprise interests. It asks us to imagine and create economic relationships based on reciprocity, respect, and recognition of Indigenous sovereignty—relationships that serve the healing our world desperately needs.</p> <hr> <p><em>This completes our exploration of decolonization and healing through regenerative enterprise. The path forward requires ongoing commitment to truth-telling, repair, and support for Indigenous sovereignty as foundations for any authentic transformation toward economies that serve life.</em></p>',1);function l(e){var n=a();i(404),o(e,n)}export{l as default,r as metadata};
