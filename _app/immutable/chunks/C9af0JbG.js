The end of these industries is often framed as an economic death sentence. The Global Governance Framework (GGF) asserts a different possibility. It provides the tools to ensure that the end of an extractive system is not an end for the community, but the beginning of a just, prosperous, and regenerative future.</p> <p>This guide is a practical playbook for that process. It is designed for community leaders, BAZ councils, regional planners, and worker cooperatives facing the daunting task of systemic economic change. It demonstrates how to use the integrated power of the GGF’s core frameworks—Hearthstone, Peace & Conflict Resolution, Work in Liberation, and AUBI—to manage a transition that is not only economically viable but also socially and ecologically healing. This is the GGF’s promise: transition is not a cliff, but a bridge, and this guide provides the blueprint to build it.</p> <hr>",1);function l(e){var t=n();a(8),i(e,t)}export{l as default};
