It demonstrates the core promise of the Global Governance Framework: that the end of an extractive system can be the beginning of a just and regenerative future. This guide has laid out a clear, viable, and replicable pathway for any community seeking to move beyond an extractive past.</p> <p>The GGFâ€™s strength lies in its integrated, multi-framework approach. By weaving together the specialized tools of four foundational frameworks, it creates a comprehensive solution:</p> <ul><li>The <strong>Hearthstone Protocol</strong> provides the legal dignity to take control of legacy assets and place them in community stewardship.</li> <li>The <strong>Peace & Conflict Resolution Framework</strong> offers the social process to heal historical wounds through truth and restorative justice.</li> <li>The <strong>Work in Liberation Framework</strong> supplies the organizational structure to empower a new workforce with dignified, purposeful roles.</li> <li>And the <strong>AUBI Framework</strong> delivers the economic engine to provide security for all and to reward the very work of regeneration.</li></ul> <p>Together, they transform a moment of crisis into a moment of creation. They build the bridge from a precarious past to a prosperous future.</p> <p>This guide was created for the leaders, the organizers, and the visionaries in communities everywhere who have been told there is no alternative. The alternative is here. The tools are ready. The path is not easy, but it is clear. The end of an era is not a cliff to fall from, but an invitation to build. Begin the conversation. Convene your community. Take the first step across the bridge.</p>",1);function h(e){var t=i();a(10),r(e,t)}export{h as default};
