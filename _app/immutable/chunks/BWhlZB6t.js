This creates a profound risk: that the “green” transition could be powered by a new wave of extractive colonialism, replicating the social and ecological harms of the fossil fuel era. The Global Governance Framework (GGF) is designed to prevent this outcome.</p> <p>This guide is not a new framework. It is a playbook. It synthesizes the powerful, pre-existing tools within the GGF ecosystem to provide a clear, step-by-step pathway for governing the stewardship of minerals and resources. It is designed for policymakers, Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ) leaders, community organizers, and regenerative enterprises to ensure that any use of the Earth’s resources is just, circular, and respects the sovereignty of local and Indigenous communities. By weaving together the principles of Indigenous sovereignty, circular economics, commons stewardship, and legal accountability, this guide provides a blueprint for a truly regenerative material future.</p> <hr>",1);function c(e){var t=a();i(8),o(e,t)}export{c as default};
