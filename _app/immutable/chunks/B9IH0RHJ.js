It builds on proven models while addressing urgent planetary health challenges through transformative governance architecture.</p> <p>Humanity faces an unprecedented convergence of health crises that transcend all boundaries: climate change is fundamentally reshaping the conditions for human health, biodiversity loss is undermining the living systems that sustain us, and mental health epidemics reflect our disconnection from each other and the natural world. These are not separate problems—they are interconnected symptoms of governance systems that treat health as an isolated sector rather than recognizing it as the foundation of all flourishing life.</p> <p>The <strong>Planetary Health Governance Framework</strong> transforms global governance from fragmented, reactive health management into integrated, regenerative stewardship of the entire web of life. This framework serves as <strong>the ethical compass and scientific foundation for all other governance systems</strong>, ensuring that every human activity—from trade and economics to technology and culture—contributes to the health of our shared planetary home.</p> <h2><a id="introduction"></a>Introduction: One Planet, One Health</h2> <p><strong>The Challenge</strong>: Current governance systems treat human health, animal health, and ecosystem health as separate domains, creating catastrophic policy incoherence. Climate change threatens $23 trillion in health costs by 2050. Mental health crises affect 1 billion people globally while social isolation reaches epidemic levels. Biodiversity loss undermines the foundation of medicine, food security, and climate stability. Meanwhile, our economic systems prioritize GDP growth that often comes at the expense of the very planetary systems that sustain all life.</p> <p><strong>The Opportunity</strong>: For the first time in human history, we understand the profound interconnection between human health and planetary health. We know that healthy ecosystems are the foundation of healthy communities, that mental health depends on social connection and relationship with nature, and that spiritual well-being is inseparable from ecological well-being. We have the scientific knowledge, technological capacity, and wisdom traditions necessary to create governance systems that serve the health of the whole.</p> <p><strong>The Framework</strong>: The Planetary Health Governance Framework provides the ethical compass, scientific metrics, and institutional architecture to ensure all governance serves the flourishing of the entire web of life. Through the <strong>Biosphere Health Index</strong> replacing GDP, the <strong>Planetary Health Council</strong> providing ethical oversight, and <strong>Planetary Health Assemblies</strong> ensuring democratic legitimacy, this framework creates governance systems that heal rather than harm our planetary home.</p> <p><a href="/frameworks/planetary-health-governance#introduction">Learn more about the Vision and Planetary Health Challenge</a></p> <h2><a id="planetary-health-charter"></a>The Planetary Health Charter</h2> <p>At the heart of this framework lies a sacred covenant with all life—a charter that codifies our deepest commitments to the health of our planetary home:</p> <ul><li><strong>Rights of Future Generations</strong>: We pledge to safeguard the health and well-being of future generations, ensuring that all decisions honor a seven-generation perspective</li> <li><strong>Intrinsic Value of Non-Human Life</strong>: All living systems—plants, animals, ecosystems—possess inherent value and the right to thrive, independent of their utility to humans</li> <li><strong>Health as a Public Good</strong>: Health, encompassing air, water, soil, seeds, and ecosystems, is a universal right and a shared commons, never to be commodified or privatized</li> <li><strong>Sacred Interbeing</strong>: We recognize the sacred interconnection of all life, where the health of one is the health of all, rooted in mutual care, respect, and spiritual relationship with the living world</li></ul> <p>This charter, co-created with global wisdom keepers, Indigenous leaders, and ethical scholars, anchors all governance decisions in a universal commitment to the flourishing of Earth’s living systems.</p> <p><a href="/frameworks/planetary-health-governance#planetary-health-charter">Learn more about the Planetary Health Charter</a></p> <h2><a id="core-principles"></a>Core Principles</h2> <p>The framework operates through seven foundational principles that guide every decision and institution:</p> <ul><li><strong>One Health (Holistic Interconnection)</strong>: Human health, animal health, and ecosystem health are one and the same—all governance decisions must recognize and honor this indivisible unity</li> <li><strong>Health as a Universal Right & Public Good</strong>: The health of any being or ecosystem is a fundamental right and shared public good, requiring the de-commodification of water, air, soil, and seeds</li> <li><strong>Living Systems Jurisprudence</strong>: Natural systems receive legal personhood and rights, ensuring their “voice” and “health” are legally represented in all governance processes</li> <li><strong>Radical Prevention & Precaution</strong>: Prioritizing proactive cultivation of health and prevention of harm at its source over reactive treatment and repair</li> <li><strong>Epistemic Justice in Health</strong>: Valuing and integrating diverse ways of knowing—Indigenous Traditional Ecological Knowledge, community wisdom, and spiritual traditions—alongside clinical and scientific knowledge</li> <li><strong>Intergenerational & Interspecies Equity</strong>: Ensuring that the health and well-being of future generations and non-human species are primary considerations in all decision-making</li> <li><strong>Health as Spiritual Relationship</strong>: Recognizing that health is fundamentally a relational and spiritual connection to the living world, complementing physical and mental dimensions</li></ul> <p>These principles work together as a living system, providing both ethical guidance and practical frameworks for resolving conflicts between competing values under pressure.</p> <p><a href="/frameworks/planetary-health-governance#core-principles">Learn more about Core Principles</a></p> <h2><a id="governance-architecture"></a>Governance Architecture</h2> <p>The framework establishes sophisticated governance institutions designed to serve as the “nervous system” of planetary health:</p> <h3>Planetary Health Council (PHC)</h3> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Primary oversight body providing strategic guidance, ethical compass, and auditing authority for all global governance frameworks</p> <p><strong>Key Mechanisms</strong>: Diverse council including Earth systems scientists, public health experts, Indigenous wisdom keepers, youth delegates, and representatives from affected communities, with anti-neocolonial safeguards ensuring Global South representation.</p> <h3>Biosphere Health Index (BHI)</h3> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Comprehensive, real-time dashboard replacing GDP as the primary measure of civilizational success</p> <p><strong>Key Mechanisms</strong>: Modular sub-indices integrating ecological indicators, human well-being metrics (including the Love, Meaning, and Connection Index), animal well-being indicators, and sacred site health monitoring co-designed with Indigenous communities.</p> <h3>Planetary Health Assemblies</h3> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Regional citizen assemblies ensuring democratic legitimacy and local health sovereignty</p> <p><strong>Key Mechanisms</strong>: Randomly selected citizens with special representation for affected communities, authority to challenge PHC decisions, and power to commission Emotional and Spiritual Health Audits providing qualitative data for the BHI.</p> <h3>Future Generations Health Council</h3> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Youth council with veto power over PHC decisions affecting long-term health</p> <p><strong>Key Mechanisms</strong>: Representatives aged 16-25 from each bioregion, Youth Environmental Justice Veto for projects exceeding BHI harm thresholds, and biennial Intergenerational Equity Audits of all PHC policies.</p> <h3>International Tribunal for the Rights of Nature</h3> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Specialized legal chamber adjudicating cases of ecocide and ecosystem rights violations</p> <p><strong>Key Mechanisms</strong>: Authority to mandate restoration and reparations, legal personhood recognition for natural systems, and Indigenous advocacy for non-human beings.</p> <p><a href="/frameworks/planetary-health-governance#governance-architecture">Learn more about Governance Architecture</a></p> <h2><a id="cross-cutting-policies"></a>Cross-Cutting Policies</h2> <p>The framework drives foundational policies that transform governance across all domains:</p> <h3>Indigenous Health Sovereignty Initiative</h3> <p>Full recognition of Indigenous peoples’ authority over their health systems, with Free, Prior, and Informed Consent protocols and formal integration of traditional healing systems into bioregional health responses.</p> <h3>Health Commons Protection</h3> <p>De-commodification and protection of essential planetary health resources through legal safeguards for water, air, soil, and seed sovereignty as shared commons.</p> <h3>Planetary Health Literacy Initiative</h3> <p>Global educational programs fostering deep understanding of life’s interconnection, integrated school curricula, and citizen science projects engaging communities in bioregional health monitoring.</p> <h3>Ethical Technology Governance</h3> <p>High-level oversight for life-altering technologies through gene-editing councils and AI ethics boards ensuring alignment with holistic well-being goals.</p> <h3>Spiritual & Philosophical Dialogue</h3> <p>Engagement with global wisdom traditions to explore non-material dimensions of planetary health and inform ethical deliberations of the Planetary Health Council.</p> <p><a href="/frameworks/planetary-health-governance#cross-cutting-policies">Learn more about Cross-Cutting Policies</a></p> <h2><a id="framework-integration"></a>Framework Integration</h2> <p>This framework serves as the ethical compass for the entire Global Governance Framework ecosystem:</p> <ul><li><strong>Global Health & Pandemic Security</strong>: Acts as the specialized “immune system” executing PHC biosecurity directives</li> <li><strong>Gaian Trade Framework</strong>: PHC audits trade routes for BHI compliance, with planetary health impact as key metric in Digital Passports</li> <li><strong>Financial Systems & AUBI</strong>: BHI health influences resource flows, with bioregions improving their scores receiving Global Commons Fund bonuses</li> <li><strong>Indigenous Governance Framework</strong>: Traditional Ecological Knowledge serves as primary BHI data source through deep partnership with the Earth Council</li> <li><strong>Meta-Governance Coordination</strong>: PHC collaborates with other councils through joint task forces resolving conflicts and aligning health impacts across frameworks</li></ul> <p>The framework ensures that planetary health considerations guide rather than constrain all other governance innovations, creating coherence across the entire ecosystem of global cooperation.</p> <p><a href="/frameworks/planetary-health-governance#framework-integration">Learn more about Framework Integration</a></p> <h2><a
