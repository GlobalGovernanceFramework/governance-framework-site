This framework measures success through community-defined indicators, long-term relationship health, and the absence of harm alongside positive outcomes.</p> <h2><a id="redefining-success"></a>Redefining Success in Technology Governance</h2> <p><em>What does technology governance success look like when measured by community flourishing rather than corporate profits?</em></p> <h3><strong>Beyond Compliance to Community Thriving</strong></h3> <p>Success in technology governance isn’t just about whether organizations follow rules—it’s about whether governance creates conditions for communities to thrive, ecosystems to regenerate, and future generations to inherit a world enhanced rather than degraded by technology.</p> <p><strong>Community-Defined Success Indicators</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Cultural Vitality</strong>: Technology supports rather than undermines language preservation, ceremonial practices, and traditional knowledge transmission</li> <li><strong>Ecological Relationship</strong>: Technology enhances rather than disrupts human-Earth relationships and traditional ecological practices</li> <li><strong>Youth Empowerment</strong>: Young people feel agency over their technological future rather than being passive consumers of imposed systems</li> <li><strong>Elder Wisdom Integration</strong>: Traditional knowledge holders see their wisdom honored and protected in technology decisions</li></ul> <p><strong><em>Example in Action:</em></strong> <em>A region implemented new agricultural AI systems over three years. Traditional compliance metrics showed 98% adoption and 15% yield increases. However, community-defined success metrics revealed concerning patterns: Indigenous seed-saving practices declined by 40%, youth increasingly disconnected from traditional farming knowledge, and soil health degraded despite higher yields. This led to governance modifications prioritizing traditional knowledge integration and community-controlled technology adaptation.</em></p> <h3><strong>Long-Term Relationship Health</strong></h3> <p><strong>Seven-Generation Thinking in Evaluation</strong>: Technology governance success is measured across Indigenous seven-generation timescales (approximately 140-200 years), assessing whether current decisions support or undermine long-term community and ecological well-being.</p> <p><strong>Relational Accountability Metrics</strong>: Rather than just measuring individual outcomes, evaluation focuses on relationship health between:</p> <ul><li><strong>Human-Technology Relationships</strong>: Whether technology enhances human agency and dignity</li> <li><strong>Community-Governance Relationships</strong>: Whether communities trust governance processes and feel heard</li> <li><strong>Technology-Ecology Relationships</strong>: Whether technological systems support ecological regeneration</li> <li><strong>Present-Future Relationships</strong>: Whether current technology decisions serve future generations</li></ul> <h2><a id="quantitative-metrics"></a>Quantitative Metrics: Numbers with Purpose</h2> <p><em>Which numbers actually tell us whether technology governance is creating conditions for community flourishing and planetary health?</em></p> <h3><strong>Adoption and Participation Metrics</strong></h3> <p><strong>Framework Adoption Rates</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Community Voluntary Adoption</strong>: Percentage of communities choosing to engage with technology governance frameworks (Target: 75% within 5 years)</li> <li><strong>Indigenous Participation Rates</strong>: Proportion of affected Indigenous communities actively participating in technology decisions affecting them (Target: 90% participation where applicable)</li> <li><strong>Youth Engagement Levels</strong>: Young people’s meaningful participation in technology governance processes (Target: 60% regular engagement in affected communities)</li> <li><strong>Cross-Framework Coordination</strong>: Successful coordination instances between TGIF and specialized frameworks like Aurora Accord and Shield Protocol (Target: 95% conflict-free coordination)</li></ul> <p><strong><em>Example in Action:</em></strong> <em>After implementing Community Tech Review Boards across a bioregion, adoption tracking showed 78% of communities established boards within 18 months. However, participation quality varied significantly: communities with Indigenous leadership showed 94% sustained engagement, while others averaged 43%. This led to enhanced cultural liaison programs and traditional governance integration training.</em></p> <h3><strong>Community Satisfaction and Trust Indicators</strong></h3> <p><strong>FPIC
