The ancestors are hoping. The Earth is waiting.</strong></p> <p><strong>Because the time has come to govern as if life matters. Because life does matter. Because we are life, awakening to itself, learning to love itself whole.</strong></p> <hr> <p><em>This is the sacred why behind every mechanism, every institution, every reform proposed in the Planetary Health Governance Framework. This is the heart that beats beneath all the practical details, the soul that animates all the technical specifications, the love that moves the sun and the other stars—and us.</em></p> <p><strong>Welcome to the governance of awakening. Welcome to the politics of love. Welcome home.</strong></p> <hr> <p><em>Planetary Health Governance Framework • Sacred Preamble • Version 1.0 • 2025</em></p>",1);function p(e){var t=a();n(108),r(e,t)}export{p as default};
