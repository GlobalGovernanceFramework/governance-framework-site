The funding mechanisms of the Global Health & Pandemic Security Framework emerge from this wisdom: creating economic systems that honor health as relationship while generating the resources necessary for planetary health security. Through Hearts currency, Leaves tokens, and community-controlled funding, these mechanisms ensure that money serves healing rather than healing serving money.</em></p> <h2><a id="regenerative-health-economics"></a>Regenerative Health Economics</h2> <h3>Beyond Extractive Health Finance</h3> <p>The funding mechanisms operate through regenerative economic principles that create value through care, healing, and ecological restoration rather than extracting value from illness, poverty, and environmental destruction.</p> <p><strong>Care as Currency</strong>: The framework recognizes care work, traditional healing, and community health activities as valuable economic contributions through Hearts currency, ensuring that the foundation of health—human relationships and traditional knowledge—receives economic recognition and support.</p> <p><strong>Ecological Health Investment</strong>: Leaves tokens provide economic incentives for ecosystem restoration, traditional agriculture, and environmental health activities that prevent pandemic risk at its ecological source while supporting Indigenous land stewardship and traditional knowledge application.</p> <p><strong>Community Wealth Building</strong>: Health funding mechanisms designed to build community wealth and traditional knowledge capacity rather than creating dependency on external aid or corporate health systems that extract value from communities.</p> <p><strong>Intergenerational Wealth</strong>: Economic systems that create wealth for future generations rather than imposing costs on young people and unborn generations, ensuring that health investments serve seven-generation thinking and intergenerational equity.</p> <p><strong>Commons-Based Finance</strong>: Health resources treated as commons to be shared rather than commodities to be hoarded, with funding mechanisms that strengthen rather than undermine community control over health systems and traditional knowledge.</p> <h3>Hearts-Leaves Economic Ecosystem</h3> <p><strong>Hearts as Care Currency</strong>: Hearts serve as the primary currency for care work, community health activities, traditional healing, and social support within the health security ecosystem, enabling communities to value and exchange care without dependence on cash economies that may undermine traditional practices.</p> <p><strong>Leaves as Ecological Currency</strong>: Leaves provide economic recognition for ecosystem restoration, traditional agriculture, medicinal plant cultivation, and environmental health activities that prevent pandemic risk while supporting traditional ecological knowledge and Indigenous land stewardship.</p> <p><strong>Love Ledger Integration</strong>: Community care activities and traditional knowledge sharing documented through the Love Ledger system generate Hearts and Leaves that can be used within the broader regenerative economy or converted to support community health priorities.</p> <p><strong>Proof of Care Verification</strong>: Care activities and ecological work verified through community-controlled protocols that honor traditional knowledge and cultural practices while preventing fraud or appropriation of traditional healing practices.</p> <p><strong>Inter-Currency Translation</strong>: Hearts and Leaves can be exchanged with other currencies and economic systems through community-controlled protocols that maintain the integrity of care and ecological relationships while enabling participation in broader economic networks.</p> <h3>Community Economic Sovereignty</h3> <p><strong>Community-Controlled Resources</strong>: Health funding mechanisms enable communities to control their own health resources rather than depending on external aid organizations, government programs, or corporate health systems that may impose external priorities or undermine traditional knowledge.</p> <p><strong>Traditional Economic Integration</strong>: Funding systems accommodate traditional economic practices including gift economies, reciprocal exchange, traditional agriculture, and community resource sharing rather than requiring communities to adopt cash-based economic systems.</p> <p><strong>Indigenous Land-Based Economics</strong>: Economic recognition for traditional land stewardship, medicinal plant cultivation, and traditional ecological knowledge that maintains ecosystem health and prevents pandemic risk through Indigenous sovereignty and traditional authority.</p> <p><strong>Youth Economic Authority</strong>: Young people exercise authority over health funding decisions that will primarily affect their generation, with opportunities to earn Hearts and Leaves through community service, traditional knowledge learning, and ecological restoration activities.</p> <p><strong>Women’s Economic Empowerment</strong>: Health funding mechanisms designed to support women’s traditional roles as
