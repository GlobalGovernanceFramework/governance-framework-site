Instead of survival jobs and gig platform exploitation, we’re building <strong>Community Work Teams</strong> that serve real needs while respecting both people and ecosystems.</p> <hr> <h2>🌍 <strong>The Vision: Work With Purpose</strong></h2> <p><strong>By 2045</strong>: 50% of people worldwide participate in meaningful work focused on:</p> <ul><li><strong>💚 Care</strong>: Supporting elders, children, families, and community wellbeing</li> <li><strong>🎨 Creativity</strong>: Arts, innovation, education, and cultural preservation</li> <li><strong>🌱 Planet Health</strong>: Ecological restoration, regenerative agriculture, clean energy</li></ul> <p><strong>Instead of</strong>: Extractive industries, exploitative gig platforms, and survival anxiety driving desperate competition.</p> <hr> <h2>💡 <strong>How It Works: Five Core Principles</strong></h2> <h3>1. 🌍 <strong>Work as Planetary Contribution</strong></h3> <p>Every project helps heal rather than harm our ecosystems and communities.</p> <h3>2. 💚 <strong>Freedom from Survival Work</strong></h3> <p>Universal Basic Income (AUBI) ensures no one takes exploitative jobs just to survive.</p> <h3>3. 🤝 <strong>Fair, Plural Rewards</strong></h3> <p>Contributions recognized through <strong>Hearts</strong> (care work) and <strong>Leaves</strong> (ecological work) currencies alongside traditional payment.</p> <h3>4. 🤖 <strong>Human-AI Symbiosis</strong></h3> <p>Technology serves human creativity and connection rather than replacing or surveilling workers.</p> <h3>5. ⚖️ <strong>Ecological and Social Justice</strong></h3> <p>Priority given to marginalized communities and environmental restoration over profit extraction.</p> <hr> <h2>🛠️ <strong>The Tools: Getting Started</strong></h2> <h3><strong>Community Work Teams</strong></h3> <p>Self-organizing groups of 3-8 neighbors collaborating on meaningful projects under democratic governance.</p> <h3><strong>Love Ledger</strong></h3> <p>Digital system (in development) tracking contributions and distributing Hearts/Leaves recognition.</p> <h3><strong>Flexible Time</strong></h3> <p>Maximum 15-hour work weeks by 2035, with neurodiversity support and cultural rhythm accommodation.</p> <h3><strong>Indigenous Leadership</strong></h3> <p>All work guided by Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Bioregional Autonomous Zone governance.</p> <hr> <h2>🚀 <strong>Three Ways to Get Involved</strong></h2> <h3><strong>🏡 Start Local: Form a Community Work Team</strong></h3> <ol><li>Gather 3-5 interested neighbors</li> <li>Use our
