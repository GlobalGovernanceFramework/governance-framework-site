No adaptation occurs without Free, Prior, and Informed Consent 2.0 from relevant cultural authorities.</p> <h2><a id="guidelines-cultural-adaptation"></a>Guidelines for Cultural Context Adaptation</h2> <h3>Core Adaptation Principles</h3> <h4><strong>Principle 1: Cultural Authority Leadership</strong></h4> <p><strong>“Nothing About Us, Without Us”</strong> - All cultural adaptations must be initiated, led, and controlled by the cultural communities themselves.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Standards</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Traditional Authority Recognition</strong>: Indigenous leaders, elders, and cultural authorities hold final decision-making power over all adaptations affecting their communities</li> <li><strong>Community Self-Determination</strong>: Cultural communities determine their own needs, priorities, and approaches to conflict resolution</li> <li><strong>External Support Role Only</strong>: Non-community practitioners serve only in supportive, resource-providing roles when requested</li> <li><strong>Veto Power Protection</strong>: Cultural authorities retain absolute right to halt, modify, or reject any proposed adaptation</li></ul> <p><strong>Practical Applications</strong>:</p> <pre class="language-undefined"><!></pre> <h4><strong>Principle 2: Authentic Relationship Requirements</strong></h4> <p><strong>Long-term, reciprocal relationships</strong> must exist before any cultural adaptation work begins.</p> <p><strong>Relationship Standards</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Minimum Engagement</strong>: 2+ years of authentic relationship building before adaptation requests</li> <li><strong>Reciprocal Contribution</strong>: External practitioners must contribute meaningfully to community priorities beyond framework work</li> <li><strong>Cultural Competency Development</strong>: Deep learning of community language, protocols, and values</li> <li><strong>Community Accountability</strong>: Practitioners maintain ongoing accountability to cultural authorities</li></ul> <p><strong>Relationship Development Process</strong>:</p> <ol><li><strong>Initial Introduction</strong>: Proper cultural protocols for meeting traditional authorities</li> <li><strong>Learning Phase</strong>: Extended period of listening, learning, and relationship building</li> <li><strong>Service Phase</strong>: Contributing to community priorities as determined by community</li> <li><strong>Trust Building</strong>: Demonstrating consistent respect for cultural protocols and authority</li> <li><strong>Invitation Phase</strong>: Community determines if and how they want framework support</li></ol> <h4><strong>Principle 3: Sacred Knowledge Protection</strong></h4> <p><strong>Absolute protection</strong> for sacred, ceremonial, and sensitive Traditional Knowledge.</p> <p><strong>Protection Categories</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Sacred Knowledge</strong>: Never documented, shared, or adapted for external use</li> <li><strong>Restricted Knowledge</strong>: Shared only within appropriate cultural contexts with traditional authority permission</li> <li><strong>Protected Knowledge</strong>: Documented with specific access restrictions and community control</li> <li><strong>Public Knowledge</strong>: Generally shareable cultural information with proper attribution</li></ul> <p><strong>Sacred Knowledge Safeguards</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Elder Guidance</strong>: Traditional knowledge keepers determine what can and cannot be shared</li> <li><strong>Ceremonial Firewall</strong>: Spiritual practices never integrated into framework without specific traditional authority guidance</li> <li><strong>Generational Protection</strong>: Information protected for seven generations or as determined by traditional law</li> <li><strong>Legal Protections</strong>: Indigenous Data Sovereignty laws and international Indigenous rights protections applied</li></ul> <h3>Cultural Adaptation

Protocols</strong>: Follow traditional methods for meeting elders and leaders</li> <li><strong>Gift Giving</strong>: Appropriate offerings as determined by cultural tradition</li>

<li><strong>External Support Interest</strong>: Community determines if they want external framework support</li> <li><strong>Capacity Analysis</strong>: Community evaluation of resources available for adaptation work</li></ul> <h4><strong>Phase 2: Co-Creation Design (3-12 months)</strong></h4> <p><strong>Step 4: Traditional Knowledge Integration Planning</strong></p> <pre class="language-undefined"><!></pre> <p><strong>Step 5: Cultural Framework Development</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Traditional Terminology</strong>: Community develops culturally appropriate language

ways</li> <li><strong>Conflict Resolution Improvement</strong>: Community assessment of enhanced dispute resolution capacity</li> <li><strong>Cultural Resilience Impact</strong>: Effect on cultural preservation and revitalization</li></ul> <p><strong>Step 9: Knowledge Sharing Decisions</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Community Consent</strong>: Community decides what aspects of adaptation can be shared</li> <li><strong>Attribution Requirements</strong>: How community wants to be credited for innovation</li> <li><strong>Benefit Sharing</strong>: Compensation for community contributions to framework development</li> <li><strong>Protection Maintenance</strong>: Ongoing safeguards for sensitive adaptation elements</li></ul> <h3>Adaptation Quality Standards</h3> <h4><strong>Cultural Authenticity Verification</strong></h4> <ul><li><strong>Elder Validation</strong>: Traditional knowledge keepers confirm adaptation authenticity</li> <li><strong>Community Consensus</strong>: Broad community agreement on adaptation appropriateness</li> <li><strong>Traditional Practice Enhancement</strong>: Adaptation strengthens rather than undermines cultural ways</li> <li><strong>Language Accuracy</strong>: Traditional terminology used properly and respectfully</li></ul> <h4><strong>Power Dynamic Assessment</strong></h4> <ul><li><strong>Community Control</strong>: Cultural community maintains decision-making authority throughout process</li> <li><strong>External Dependency Prevention</strong>: Adaptation does not create reliance on external practitioners</li> <li><strong>Cultural Sovereignty Protection</strong>: Community’s right to self-determination fully respected</li> <li><strong>Economic Justice</strong>: Fair compensation for community intellectual and cultural contributions</li></ul> <h4><strong>Sustainability Evaluation</strong></h4> <ul><li><strong>Community Ownership</strong>: Adaptation becomes community property and responsibility</li> <li><strong>Traditional Knowledge Protection</strong>: Long-term safeguards for sacred and sensitive information</li> <li><strong>Cultural Transmission</strong>: Adaptation supports intergenerational knowledge transfer</li> <li><strong>Framework Independence</strong>: Community can implement adaptation without ongoing external support</li></ul> <h2><a
