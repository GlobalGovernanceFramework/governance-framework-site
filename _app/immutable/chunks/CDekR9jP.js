This definitional foundation ensures shared understanding of key concepts across diverse stakeholders—farmers, policymakers, indigenous communities, youth, and global partners—while grounding technical terms in the principles of ecological regeneration, Indigenous sovereignty, and systemic coordination.</p> <p>These definitions bridge traditional knowledge with contemporary science, local autonomy with global cooperation, and urgent action with seven-generation thinking to create food systems that nourish both people and planet.</p> <h2><a id="regenerative-agriculture"></a>Regenerative Agriculture</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Farming practices that restore soil health, enhance biodiversity, and sequester carbon, such as cover cropping, no-till farming, and agroforestry. These methods improve ecosystem functions, increase resilience to climate change, and support long-term agricultural productivity while operating within planetary boundaries.</p> <p><strong>Golden Triangle Integration</strong>: Regenerative agriculture represents the practical application of the Golden Triangle’s ecological principles to food production. It operationalizes the <strong>Rights of Nature</strong> provisions from the <a href="/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars">Treaty for Our Only Home</a>, implements the <strong>bioregional governance</strong> and <strong>seventh-generation accountability</strong> principles from the <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#core-principles">Indigenous Framework</a>, and benefits from the <strong>Food Systems Meta-Council</strong> coordination described in the <a href="/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components">Meta-Governance Framework</a>.</p> <p><strong>Traditional Knowledge Foundation</strong>: Regenerative practices draw extensively from Traditional Ecological Knowledge systems that have sustained Indigenous communities for millennia. Within <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components">Bioregional Autonomous Zones</a>, Traditional Agroforestry and Indigenous farming methods guide regenerative transitions, ensuring practices are culturally appropriate and ecologically effective.</p> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Methods to improve land for sustainable farming, making soil healthier, protecting wildlife, and storing carbon to fight climate change, guided by Indigenous wisdom and supported by global coordination.</p> <p><strong>Context</strong>: Regenerative agriculture is central to the framework’s goal of achieving 30% of global farmland under regenerative practices by 2035, funded through the <a href="/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars">Treaty’s Global Taxation mechanisms</a> and coordinated through the Meta-Governance <a href="#food-systems-meta-council">Food Systems Meta-Council</a> that aligns agricultural, water, climate, and economic policies.</p> <h3>Visual: Conventional vs. Regenerative Agriculture Practices</h3> <p><img src="/images/frameworks/food-systems/agriculture-comparison-chart.svg" alt="Conventional vs. Regenerative Agriculture Practices"></p> <p><strong>Description</strong>: This comparison chart illustrates the fundamental differences between conventional and regenerative agriculture approaches, emphasizing both practices and their long-term impacts. The visual clearly demonstrates how regenerative methods restore rather than deplete natural resources, aligning directly with the framework’s strategic objectives and the Golden Triangle’s ecological integrity principles.</p> <p><strong>Key Insights</strong>:</p> <ul><li>Regenerative practices reduce dependence on external inputs</li> <li>Soil health is actively improved rather than degraded</li> <li>Long-term economic benefits through lower input costs</li> <li>Environmental benefits include carbon sequestration and biodiversity enhancement</li> <li>Cultural integration honors Traditional Ecological Knowledge</li></ul> <h2><a id="agroecology"></a>Agroecology</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: An approach integrating ecological principles into agriculture, prioritizing local knowledge, biodiversity, and minimal external inputs (e.g., synthetic fertilizers). It emphasizes sustainable, community-driven farming systems that adapt to local ecosystems while respecting Traditional Ecological Knowledge and Indigenous governance systems.</p> <p><strong>Indigenous Sovereignty Integration</strong>: Agroecology serves as a bridge between traditional Indigenous farming systems and contemporary ecological science. Within the <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge">Indigenous Framework</a>, agroecology supports <strong>Traditional Knowledge Protection</strong> through the <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components">Global Indigenous Creative Commons</a> while enabling <strong>regenerative economics</strong> that strengthen rather than exploit Indigenous communities.</p> <p><strong>Treaty Mechanism Support</strong>: Agroecological transitions are funded through the <a href="/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars">Treaty’s Payment for Global Public Goods Fund</a>, with <strong>sovereignty bargain</strong> arrangements helping powerful nations transition from industrial agriculture while respecting Indigenous territorial rights and traditional farming systems.</p> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Farming that works with nature, using local wisdom to grow food sustainably with fewer chemicals, honoring Indigenous knowledge and supported by global funding.</p> <p><strong>Context</strong>: Agroecology underpins the framework’s sustainable practices, supporting the training of 5 million farmers by 2030 and preserving genetic diversity through <strong>Indigenous-controlled seed banks</strong> protected within the Global Indigenous Creative Commons, as outlined in the Strategic Objectives and coordinated through Meta-Governance <strong>dynamic interoperability</strong> principles.</p> <h2><a id="food-security"></a>Food Security</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Consistent access to sufficient, safe, and nutritious food that meets dietary needs and cultural preferences for an active and healthy life, as defined by the United Nations (UN) Right to Food and implemented through the Treaty’s institutional mechanisms.</p> <p><strong>Institutional Foundation</strong>: Food security is guaranteed through the <a href="/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars">Treaty’s expanded UN General Assembly powers</a> and <strong>Global Enforcement Mechanism</strong>, which ensure universal access to nutritious food as a fundamental human right enforced through international law.</p> <p><strong>Meta-Governance Coordination</strong>: The <strong>Food Systems Meta-Council</strong> coordinates food security efforts across agriculture, water management, climate adaptation, and economic systems, using the <a href="/frameworks/meta-governance#value-proposition">Value Proposition framework</a> to incentivize regenerative food production while ensuring equitable distribution.</p> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Ensuring everyone has enough safe, healthy, and culturally appropriate food every day, protected by international law and coordinated globally.</p> <p><strong>Context</strong>: Food security is a core objective, with the framework targeting a 50% reduction in global hunger by 2030 through enhanced local food systems coordinated through <a href="#bioregional-autonomous-zones">Bioregional Autonomous Zones</a> and funded by the Treaty’s global taxation mechanisms.</p> <h2><a id="food-sovereignty"></a>Food Sovereignty</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: The right of peoples to healthy and culturally appropriate food produced through ecologically sound and sustainable methods, and their right to define their own food and agriculture systems, as articulated by La Vía Campesina and foundational to Indigenous governance frameworks.</p> <p><strong>Indigenous Leadership</strong>: Food sovereignty centers Indigenous authority over traditional territories and food systems within <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components">Bioregional Autonomous Zones</a>. Unlike food security which focuses on access, food sovereignty emphasizes community control over production methods, seed varieties, and distribution systems in alignment with <strong>Traditional Ecological Knowledge</strong> and <strong>ceremonial governance</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Golden Triangle Implementation</strong>: Food sovereignty is operationalized through the combination of the <a href="/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#implementation-strategies">Treaty’s sovereignty bargain model</a> (which protects local food systems from external domination), the <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#implementation-timeline">Indigenous Framework’s land rematriation</a> processes, and the <a href="/frameworks/meta-governance#principles">Meta-Governance Framework’s subsidiarity principle</a> ensuring food decisions remain at the most local level possible.</p> <p><strong>Treaty Protection</strong>: The Treaty’s <strong>Rights of Nature</strong> legislation and <strong>ecocide law</strong> protect the ecological foundation of food sovereignty by preventing industrial agriculture from degrading the land and water systems essential for community-controlled food production.</p> <p><em>Accessible explanation</em>: Communities’ right to control their own food systems, deciding what to grow, how to grow it, and how to share it, protected from outside interference.</p> <p><strong>Context</strong>: Food sovereignty guides all framework objectives, ensuring that solutions strengthen rather than undermine community autonomy over food systems while building resilience through the integration of traditional knowledge and ecological restoration.</p> <h2><a id="traditional-ecological-knowledge"></a>Traditional Ecological Knowledge (TEK)</h2> <p><strong>Definition</strong>: Indigenous and local environmental wisdom developed over generations through direct relationship with specific territories, encompassing sustainable resource management, ecological relationships, and governance systems that have maintained biodiversity and community resilience for millennia.</p> <p><strong>Sovereignty and Protection</strong>: TEK is protected through the <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components">Global Indigenous Creative Commons</a> which provides <strong>automatic protection</strong> for traditional knowledge while enabling <strong>ethical sharing</strong> through Indigenous-controlled protocols.
