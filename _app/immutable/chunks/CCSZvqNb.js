Will trade serve as a bridge of solidarity or a weapon of division? The choices we make in our darkest hours determine whether commerce becomes a force for healing or harm.”</em></p></blockquote> <p>The Gaian Trade Framework recognizes that crises—whether climate disasters, geopolitical conflicts, technological disruptions, or economic upheavals—test the resilience and values of any trade system. This section ensures that regenerative trade patterns not only survive under pressure but actually strengthen communities and ecosystems during their greatest vulnerabilities, creating <strong>antifragile commerce</strong> that grows stronger through stress.</p> <h2>Supply Chain Crisis Protocol: 24-Hour Solidarity Response</h2> <p><strong>Goal</strong>: Activate coordinated
