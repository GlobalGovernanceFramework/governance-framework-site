They emerge from Indigenous wisdom about sustainable work relationships while addressing contemporary challenges of automation, ecological crisis, and global inequality. Together, they provide both ethical guidance and practical frameworks for organizing work that serves life rather than exploiting it.</p> <h2><a id="work-as-planetary-contribution"></a>Principle 1: Work as Planetary Contribution</h2> <blockquote><p><em>“All work is sacred when it serves the web of life that connects us all.”</em></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Principle</strong>: Work must prioritize care, creativity, and planetary health over profit extraction, with contributions measured through regenerative impact rather than monetary accumulation.</p> <p><strong>Traditional Foundation</strong>: Indigenous work systems have always organized productive activity around seasonal cycles, ecosystem health, and seven-generation thinking. The Haudenosaunee Three Sisters agriculture demonstrates work that enhances rather than depletes natural systems. Aboriginal Australian seasonal rounds show how human labor can follow natural rhythms while meeting community needs sustainably.</p> <p><strong>Contemporary Application</strong>: This principle transforms work organization through:</p> <p><strong>Post-Growth Economic Doctrine</strong>: Success measured through Gross Planetary Health rather than Gross Domestic Product, with comprehensive metrics including:</p> <ul><li><strong>Ecological Health</strong>: Biodiversity recovery, carbon sequestration, soil regeneration, watershed restoration</li> <li><strong>Social Wellbeing</strong>: Care work recognition, community resilience, cultural preservation, mental health support</li> <li><strong>Future Generations</strong>: Seven-generation impact assessment, youth leadership development, traditional knowledge transmission</li></ul> <p><strong>Hearts and Leaves Integration</strong>: Meaningful contributions rewarded through complementary currencies aligned with the <a href="/frameworks/financial-systems">Financial Systems Framework</a>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Hearts</strong>: Care work, mentorship, cultural preservation, community organizing, conflict resolution</li> <li><strong>Leaves</strong>: Ecological restoration, renewable energy development, biodiversity protection, climate adaptation</li> <li><strong>Love Ledger</strong>: Transparent tracking ensuring all planetary contributions receive recognition and reward</li></ul> <p><strong>Community Work Teams</strong>: Democratic organization replacing extractive employment with cooperative contribution:</p> <ul><li><strong>Watershed Guardianship</strong>: Teams restoring local water systems while earning Leaves for ecological impact</li> <li><strong>Elder Care Circles</strong>: Intergenerational care teams earning Hearts for social support and wisdom transmission</li> <li><strong>Cultural Preservation Projects</strong>: Youth-elder partnerships documenting traditional knowledge while earning both Hearts and Leaves</li> <li><strong>Renewable Transition Teams</strong>: Worker cooperatives building community energy systems</li></ul> <p><strong>Implementation Mechanisms</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Planetary Impact Assessment</strong>: All work evaluated for regenerative vs. extractive effects</li> <li><strong>Community Validation</strong>: Local BAZ councils verify work serves genuine needs rather than manufactured demands</li> <li><strong>Seasonal Alignment</strong>: Work schedules follow ecological and cultural rhythms rather than industrial time</li> <li><strong>Intergenerational Review</strong>: Youth councils evaluate long-term impacts of work organization decisions</li></ul> <p><strong>Case Study: Restoring Watersheds and Culture in the Cascadia BAZ</strong></p> <p>In the Pacific Northwest Bioregional Autonomous Zone (BAZ), <strong>Community Work Teams</strong> organize salmon restoration projects that combine Indigenous traditional knowledge with contemporary ecological science. Workers earn <strong>Leaves</strong> for habitat restoration while learning traditional fishing protocols from elders, creating both ecological recovery and cultural revitalization.</p> <p><strong>GGF Mechanisms in Action:</strong></p> <ul><li>Community Work Teams with Indigenous leadership</li> <li>Leaves currency rewarding ecological restoration</li> <li>Love Ledger tracking regenerative contributions</li> <li>Traditional Ecological Knowledge integration</li></ul> <p><strong>Real-World Analogue:</strong> This scenario is inspired by the work of the <strong>Columbia River Inter-Tribal Fish Commission (CRITFC)</strong>, which for decades has successfully blended Traditional Ecological Knowledge from the Umatilla, Warm Springs, Yakama, and Nez Perce tribes with modern science to restore salmon populations in the Pacific Northwest.</p> <h2><a id="freedom-from-survival-work"></a>Principle 2: Freedom from Survival Work</h2> <blockquote><p><em>“When people are free from fear of tomorrow, they can give their best gifts today.”</em></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Principle</strong>: Economic security through AUBI Layer 1 eliminates survival anxiety, enabling refusal of exploitative work and choice about meaningful contribution.</p> <p><strong>Traditional Foundation</strong>: Indigenous gift economies demonstrate how abundance-based systems enable contribution without coercion. Potlatch ceremonies show how wealth circulation creates security for all community members. Traditional sharing protocols ensure no one performs degrading work simply to survive.</p> <p><strong>Contemporary Application</strong>: This principle operates through:</p> <p><strong>AUBI Layer 1 Foundation</strong>: Unconditional baseline income (70% fiat, 30% Hearts) ensuring freedom from survival anxiety:</p> <ul><li><strong>Dignity Floor</strong>: Sufficient resources for housing, food, healthcare, transportation, cultural participation</li> <li><strong>No Conditionality</strong>: Income guaranteed regardless of work participation, health status, or life circumstances</li> <li><strong>Regional Adjustment</strong>: Amounts adjusted for local cost of living while maintaining universal access</li> <li><strong>Hearts Integration</strong>: Partial payment in Hearts connects recipients to care economy and community networks</li></ul> <p><strong>Flexible Time Protocols</strong>: Accessibility-driven schedules supporting human flourishing rather than demanding sacrifice:</p> <ul><li><strong>15-Hour Weekly Maximum</strong>: Universal work cap by 2035, democratically reviewed for potential reduction</li> <li><strong>Neurodiversity Support</strong>: Accommodations for different cognitive styles, energy patterns, and communication needs</li> <li><strong>Cultural Rhythm Accommodation</strong>: Work schedules align with cultural practices, ceremonial calendars, and seasonal cycles</li> <li><strong>Life Circumstance Flexibility</strong>: Reduced expectations during illness, caregiving responsibilities, or personal crisis</li></ul> <p><strong>Right to Refuse</strong>: Protection from coercive work arrangements:</p> <ul><li><strong>Exploitative Work Veto</strong>: Right to refuse dangerous, degrading, or ecologically harmful work without penalty</li> <li><strong>Community Support</strong>: Collective backing for individuals exercising refusal rights</li> <li><strong>Alternative Creation</strong>: Community responsibility to develop meaningful alternatives to refused work</li> <li><strong>Blacklist Protection</strong>: Legal safeguards preventing retaliation for work refusal</li></ul> <p><strong>Accessibility and Inclusion</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Universal Design</strong>: All work opportunities designed for diverse abilities and circumstances</li> <li><strong>Communication Support</strong>: Multiple languages, literacy levels, and communication styles accommodated</li> <li><strong>Technology Access</strong>: Digital tools available with offline alternatives for disconnected communities</li> <li><strong>Cultural Competency</strong>: Work organization respects diverse cultural approaches to time, productivity, and contribution</li></ul> <p><strong>Implementation Mechanisms</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>AUBI Pilots</strong>: Progressive implementation beginning in Bioregional Autonomous Zones</li> <li><strong>Flexible Time Standards</strong>: Legal requirements for maximum hours and accessibility accommodations</li> <li><strong>Community Enforcement</strong>: Local councils monitoring compliance with freedom from survival work principles</li> <li><strong>Crisis Support</strong>: Enhanced AUBI during personal or community emergencies</li></ul> <p><strong>Case Study: Economic Freedom Through Mobile AUBI in East Africa</strong></p> <p>In rural Kenya’s BAZ pilot, <strong>AUBI Layer 1</strong> delivered through mobile payment systems enables farmers to refuse exploitative crop contracts while developing community-controlled food systems. <strong>Flexible Time protocols</strong> accommodate seasonal agricultural rhythms and cultural obligations, allowing farmers to choose meaningful work aligned with traditional practices.</p> <p><strong>GGF Mechanisms in Action:</strong></p> <ul><li>AUBI Layer 1 providing unconditional economic security</li> <li>Mobile payment integration with Hearts currency</li> <li>Flexible Time accommodating cultural rhythms</li> <li>Community Work Teams for agricultural cooperation</li></ul> <p><strong>Real-World Analogue:</strong> This scenario builds directly on <strong>GiveDirectly’s large-scale Universal Basic Income studies in Kenya</strong>, which use M-Pesa mobile payments and have documented significant increases in economic freedom, entrepreneurship, and community wellbeing among rural recipients.</p> <h2><a id="fair-plural-rewards"></a>Principle 3: Fair, Plural Rewards</h2> <blockquote><p><em>“Value flows in many streams—money is only one, and often not the most important.”</em></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Principle</strong>: Multiple forms of recognition honor diverse contributions, with Hearts/Leaves currencies complementing monetary rewards while protecting Indigenous knowledge and ensuring equitable distribution.</p> <p><strong>Traditional Foundation</strong>: Indigenous economies operate through reciprocity networks that value gifts, relationships, and cultural contributions alongside material exchange. Andean <em>ayni</em> principles demonstrate how mutual aid creates wealth through shared work. Gift economies show how diverse forms of value create abundance for entire communities.</p> <p><strong>Contemporary Application</strong>: This principle creates multiple recognition streams:</p> <p><strong>Hearts and Leaves Distribution</strong>: AUBI Layer 2/3 bonuses reward meaningful contributions:</p> <ul><li><strong>Hearts for Care</strong>: Childcare, eldercare, disability support, mental health assistance, community organizing</li> <li><strong>Leaves for Ecology</strong>: Carbon sequestration, habitat restoration, renewable energy, regenerative agriculture</li> <li><strong>Cultural Bonuses</strong>: Traditional knowledge transmission, language preservation, ceremonial leadership</li> <li><strong>Innovation Recognition</strong>: Problem-solving, artistic creation, technological development serving community needs</li></ul> <p><strong>Indigenous Knowledge Protection</strong>: Traditional ecological and cultural knowledge safeguarded through:</p> <ul><li><strong>Community Control</strong>: Indigenous communities maintain authority over their knowledge sharing and application</li> <li><strong>Benefit Sharing</strong>: Economic returns from traditional knowledge applications flow to originating communities</li> <li><strong>Sacred Knowledge Boundaries</strong>: Spiritual and ceremonial knowledge protected from commercialization</li> <li><strong>Red Lines Clauses</strong>: Communities can withdraw knowledge from use if misappropriated or misused</li></ul> <p><strong>Creative Commons Labor License</strong>: Protection for non-market contributions:</p> <ul><li><strong>Open Source Recognition</strong>: Credits and compensation for shared innovations and creative works</li> <li><strong>Community Ownership</strong>: Collective ownership of work products serving community needs</li> <li><strong>AI Ethics Standards</strong>: Ensuring artificial intelligence doesn’t exploit or replace human creativity</li> <li><strong>Cultural Commons</strong>: Protecting traditional and contemporary cultural expressions from appropriation</li></ul> <p><strong>Value Circulation Systems</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Local Currency Networks</strong>: Hearts/Leaves circulating within bioregional economies</li> <li><strong>Time Banking Integration</strong>: Hour-for-hour exchange complementing monetary systems</li> <li><strong>Gift Economy Revival</strong>: Traditional giving practices supported through Hearts recognition</li> <li><strong>Mutual Aid Networks</strong>: Community support systems enhanced through plural reward recognition</li></ul> <p><strong>Anti-Exploitation Safeguards</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Wage Floor Protection</strong>: Hearts/Leaves complement but don’t replace living wages for essential work</li> <li><strong>Cultural Appropriation Prevention</strong>: Legal and economic protection against traditional knowledge theft</li> <li><strong>Community Validation</strong>: Local councils verify reward distribution serves community rather than individual accumulation</li> <li><strong>Equity Audits</strong>: Regular assessment ensuring rewards reach marginalized communities rather than concentrating among privileged groups</li></ul> <p><strong>Implementation Mechanisms</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Love Ledger Integration</strong>: Blockchain tracking ensuring transparent and fair distribution</li> <li><strong>Community Validation Protocols</strong>: Local review of contribution claims and reward allocation</li> <li><strong>Cultural Sensitivity Training</strong>: Education for all participants on Indigenous knowledge protection</li> <li><strong>Dispute Resolution</strong>: Community courts addressing conflicts over recognition and reward distribution</li></ul> <p><strong>Case Study: Hearts Currency Supporting Immigrant Communities in Northern Europe</strong></p> <p>In Urban Sweden’s pilot program, <strong>Hearts currency</strong> integrates with existing social services, enabling immigrant communities to earn recognition for cultural knowledge sharing while receiving protection from appropriation through <strong>Creative Commons Labor Licensing</strong>. Traditional cooking, language instruction, and cultural mediation earn Hearts while maintaining community ownership of cultural knowledge.</p> <p><strong>GGF Mechanisms in Action:</strong></p> <ul><li>Hearts currency recognizing cultural contributions</li> <li>Creative Commons Labor License protecting traditional knowledge</li> <li>Integration with existing social services</li> <li>Community validation of cultural work</li></ul> <p><strong>Real-World Analogue:</strong> This scenario extends Sweden’s existing <strong>integration programs for immigrant communities</strong>, which already recognize cultural contributions through language exchange programs and cultural centers, while addressing appropriation concerns raised by Indigenous and immigrant advocacy organizations.</p> <h2><a id="human-ai-symbiosis"></a>Principle 4: Human-AI Symbiosis</h2> <blockquote><p><em>“Technology must serve the children of the Earth, not replace them.”</em></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Principle</strong>: AI and automation enhance human creativity and connection rather than replacing human agency, with community control over workplace technology and protection from algorithmic exploitation.</p> <p><strong>Traditional Foundation</strong>: Indigenous knowledge systems demonstrate sophisticated information processing through oral tradition, ecological observation, and collective decision-making. These systems show how complex information can be handled through human networks rather than centralized technological control.</p> <p><strong>Contemporary Application</strong>: This principle ensures technology serves rather than supplants human wisdom:</p> <p><strong>Automation Dividend</strong>: Fair distribution of AI-generated wealth:</p> <ul><li><strong>50% Productivity Gains</strong>: Half of automation savings fund AUBI bonuses and Community Work Team support</li> <li><strong>Transparent Auditing</strong>: Public oversight of automation impact measurement and benefit distribution</li> <li><strong>Community Investment</strong>: Automation dividends fund local infrastructure, education, and cultural programs</li> <li><strong>Worker Transition Support</strong>: Comprehensive retraining and alternative work creation for displaced workers</li></ul> <p><strong>Turing Council</strong>: Democratic oversight of AI development and deployment:</p> <ul><li><strong>Community Representation</strong>: Local councils have veto power over workplace AI implementation</li> <li><strong>Bias Prevention</strong>: Regular audits ensuring AI systems don’t perpetuate racial, gender, or cultural discrimination</li> <li><strong>Cultural Sensitivity</strong>: AI development includes Indigenous perspectives and non-Western knowledge systems</li> <li><strong>Human Agency Protection</strong>: Mandatory human oversight for all decisions affecting worker wellbeing and community health</li></ul> <p><strong>Co-Creation Standards</strong>: Human-AI collaboration maintaining human creativity and agency:</p> <ul><li><strong>Creativity Parity</strong>: AI assists rather than replaces human creative processes</li> <li><strong>Decision Authority</strong>: Humans retain final authority over all ethical and strategic choices</li> <li><strong>Skill Enhancement</strong>: Technology designed to expand rather than diminish human capabilities</li> <li><strong>Relationship Preservation</strong>: AI deployment strengthens rather than weakens human connections and community bonds</li></ul> <p><strong>Community Technology Sovereignty</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Local Control</strong>: Communities own and control workplace technology rather than being controlled by it</li> <li><strong>Open Source Requirements</strong>: Essential workplace AI must be transparent and community-modifiable</li> <li><strong>Privacy Protection</strong>: Worker data sovereignty with community-controlled algorithms</li> <li><strong>Alternative Options</strong>: Offline and low-tech alternatives available for all essential functions</li></ul> <p><strong>Algorithmic Justice</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Exploitation Prevention</strong>: AI cannot be used to increase work intensity, extend hours, or reduce worker autonomy</li> <li><strong>Surveillance Limits</strong>: Workplace monitoring restrictions protecting worker dignity and privacy</li> <li><strong>Predictive Bias Prevention</strong>: AI systems cannot make decisions based on protected characteristics or community membership</li> <li><strong>Community Appeals</strong>: Workers can collectively challenge AI decisions affecting their work and wellbeing</li></ul> <p><strong>Implementation Mechanisms</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Technology Impact Assessments</strong>: Community review of all workplace AI before implementation</li> <li><strong>Human-AI Collaboration Protocols</strong>: Standards ensuring technology enhances rather than replaces human judgment</li> <li><strong>Community Technology Cooperatives</strong>: Worker-owned platforms replacing extractive gig economy apps</li> <li><strong>AI Ethics Education</strong>: Training for workers and community members on technology governance rights</li></ul> <p><strong>Case Study: Indigenous AI for Ecological Stewardship in Turtle Island</strong></p> <p>In Indigenous Canada’s BAZ, <strong>AI systems for ecological monitoring</strong> integrate traditional knowledge with sensor data, with Indigenous communities maintaining complete control over data use and ensuring AI recommendations align with traditional governance protocols. The <strong>Turing Council</strong> includes Indigenous representatives with veto power over AI deployment affecting traditional territories.</p> <p><strong>GGF Mechanisms in Action:</strong></p> <ul><li>Community-controlled AI development</li> <li>Traditional Ecological Knowledge integration</li> <li>Indigenous data sovereignty protocols</li> <li>Turing Council democratic oversight</li></ul> <p><strong>Real-World Analogue:</strong> This scenario builds on the principles of <strong>Indigenous data sovereignty championed by the First Nations Information Governance Centre (FNIGC)</strong> in Canada and active projects like the <strong>Indigenous Protocol and AI Collective</strong>, which works to ensure AI development respects Indigenous values and governance systems.</p> <h2><a id="ecological-social-justice"></a>Principle 5: Ecological and Social Justice</h2> <blockquote><p><em>“Healing the Earth and healing our communities are the same work.”</em></p></blockquote> <p><strong>Principle</strong>: Work organization must address both environmental restoration and social equity, with systematic elimination of industries that harm people and planet while ensuring just transition for affected workers.</p> <p><strong>Traditional Foundation</strong>: Indigenous governance systems inherently integrate social and ecological wellbeing, recognizing that human and environmental health are inseparable. Traditional resource management demonstrates how sustainable practices serve both community needs and ecosystem health across generations.</p> <p><strong>Contemporary Application</strong>: This principle coordinates ecological restoration with social justice:</p> <p><strong>Industrial Sunsetting with Just Transition</strong>: Systematic elimination of harmful industries under Treaty Ecocide law:</p> <ul><li><strong>Fossil Fuel Phase-out</strong>: Complete elimination by 2035 with comprehensive worker support</li> <li><strong>Fast Fashion Transformation</strong>: Transition to local, durable goods production by 2038</li> <li><strong>Industrial Agriculture Reform</strong>: Shift to regenerative food systems supporting rural communities</li> <li><strong>Extraction Industry Closure</strong>: Mining and logging operations replaced with restoration work</li></ul> <p><strong>Just Transition Implementation</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Worker Retraining</strong>: Comprehensive education for renewable energy, ecological restoration, and care work</li> <li><strong>Community Economic Development</strong>: Local business support and cooperative development in transition regions</li> <li><strong>Income Security</strong>: AUBI Layer 1 ensuring economic stability during industry transformation</li> <li><strong>Cultural Preservation</strong>: Protection of traditional livelihoods and knowledge systems during economic change</li></ul> <p><strong>Non-Human Stakeholder Recognition</strong>: Ecosystems and species granted labor rights through Treaty law:</p> <ul><li><strong>Habitat Restoration Jobs</strong>: Work opportunities explicitly focused on species recovery and ecosystem health</li> <li><strong>Pollinator Protection Programs</strong>: Agricultural work designed to support bee, butterfly, and bird populations</li> <li><strong>Watershed Stewardship</strong>: Employment focused on water quality improvement and aquatic ecosystem recovery</li> <li><strong>Carbon Sequestration Work</strong>: Forest restoration and soil health improvement as recognized employment categories</li></ul> <p><strong>Community Work Team Replacement</strong>: Democratic alternatives to exploitative gig platforms:</p> <ul><li><strong>Cooperative Ownership</strong>: Worker-owned platforms replacing Uber, DoorDash, TaskRabbit by 2040</li> <li><strong>Community Validation</strong>: Local councils verify work serves genuine needs rather than manufactured demand</li> <li><strong>Fair Compensation</strong>: Hearts/Leaves payment ensuring workers receive full value of their contributions</li> <li><strong>Mutual Aid Integration</strong>: Work organization supporting community resilience rather than individual competition</li></ul> <p><strong>Environmental Justice Integration</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Frontline Community Leadership</strong>: Communities most affected by environmental harm lead restoration efforts</li> <li><strong>Pollution Cleanup Employment</strong>: Good jobs focused on remediating environmental damage in affected communities</li> <li><strong>Green Gentrification Prevention</strong>: Community ownership ensuring environmental improvements benefit existing residents</li> <li><strong>Indigenous Land Rights</strong>: Work supporting land rematriation and traditional territory restoration</li></ul> <p><strong>Social Justice Coordination</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Anti-Oppression Training</strong>: All work organization includes education on racism, sexism, and other forms of discrimination</li> <li><strong>Accessibility Standards</strong>: Universal design ensuring work opportunities include disabled community members</li> <li><strong>Immigration Justice</strong>: Work organization supporting undocumented workers and refugee communities</li> <li><strong>Criminal Justice Reform</strong>: Work opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals returning to communities</li></ul> <p><strong>Implementation Mechanisms</strong>:</p> <ul><li><strong>Planetary Health Council</strong>: Coordination between ecological restoration and social justice initiatives</li> <li><strong>Community Impact Assessment</strong>: Evaluation ensuring work serves both environmental and social healing</li> <li><strong>Intersectional Analysis</strong>: Recognition that environmental and social problems share common root causes</li> <li><strong>Movement Coordination</strong>: Alignment between environmental, labor, and social justice organizing</li></ul> <p><strong>Case Study: Climate Resilience Through Mangrove Restoration in South Asia</strong></p> <p>In Bangladesh’s coastal BAZ, <strong>Community Work Teams</strong> coordinate mangrove restoration with community resilience building, creating jobs for climate-displaced communities while protecting against sea level rise and strengthening local food systems. Workers earn enhanced <strong>Leaves</strong> for coastal protection work while receiving <strong>Just Transition</strong> support from declining industries.</p> <p><strong>GGF Mechanisms in Action:</strong></p> <ul><li>Community Work Teams for ecological restoration</li> <li>Leaves currency for climate adaptation work</li> <li>Just Transition support for displaced workers</li> <li>Integration of environmental and social justice</li></ul> <p><strong>Real-World Analogue:</strong> This scenario is inspired by <strong>Bangladesh’s community-based mangrove restoration programs</strong>, led by organizations like BRAC and the Forest Department, which have successfully combined ecosystem restoration with livelihood creation and climate resilience for vulnerable coastal communities.</p> <h2><a id="principles-in-practice"></a>Principles in Practice: Integration and Conflict Resolution</h2> <p>These five principles work together as a living system, but tensions inevitably arise between competing values. The framework includes specific protocols for navigating these tensions constructively:</p> <h3><strong>Principle Integration Framework</strong></h3> <p><strong>Economic Security vs. Ecological

implementation and needed adjustments</li> <li><strong>Annual Framework Review</strong>: Bioregional assessment of principle effectiveness and evolution needs</li> <li><strong>Conflict Documentation</strong>: Systematic tracking of principle conflicts and resolution approaches</li> <li><strong>Learning Integration</strong>: Continuous improvement based on community experience and changing conditions</li></ul> <p><strong>Cultural Sensitivity</strong>: Ensuring principles adapt to diverse community contexts:</p> <ul><li><strong>Indigenous Guidance</strong>: Ongoing consultation with traditional knowledge keepers about principle application</li> <li><strong>Cultural Adaptation</strong>: Local modification of principles respecting diverse community values and practices</li> <li><strong>Youth Leadership</strong>: Next-generation involvement in principle evolution and adaptation</li> <li><strong>Intersectional Analysis</strong>: Recognition that principle application must address multiple forms of oppression and identity</li></ul> <hr> <p><strong>Next Steps</strong>: These core principles provide the ethical foundation for Work in Liberation implementation. Continue to <a href="/frameworks/work-in-liberation#core-components">Core Components</a> to explore the practical structures enabling these principles, or access the <a href="/frameworks/tools/work-in-liberation/community-work-team-starter-kit.pdf">Community Work Team Starter Kit</a> to begin organizing work around these values in your community.</p> <p><strong>Implementation Note</strong>: The five principles must be implemented together as an integrated system—economic security enables ecological work, AI symbiosis supports community control, and social justice coordinates with environmental restoration. Communities should begin with the principles most aligned with their current values while building toward comprehensive implementation over time.</p>',1);function m(n){var i=s();t(270),e(n,i)}export{m as default,r as metadata};
