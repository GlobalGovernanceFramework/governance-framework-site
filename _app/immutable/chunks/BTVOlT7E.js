Her presentation includes detailed budgets, legal frameworks, and success metrics from similar pilots in Bristol and Barcelona. Maya testifies next, showing how Hearts payments for watershed restoration could create 50 green jobs while improving flood protection for the entire region. Joseph speaks last, requesting Indigenous sovereignty protections and traditional knowledge protocols that ensure Hearts systems strengthen rather than exploit his community’s economic traditions. The Council faces a choice: continue business-as-usual economics that generate crisis and inequality, or pioneer economic systems that serve Right Relationship.</em></p> <p><em>Their proposals represent three integrated levels of nested economies implementation: local communities taking control of their economic destinies, bioregional coordination for ecosystem-scale challenges, and global systems that enable rather than constrain local innovation. Implementation succeeds when all three levels develop simultaneously through coordinated strategy rather than isolated experiments.</em></p> <h2><a id="local-implementation"></a>Local Economic Implementation</h2> <p>Local implementation provides the foundation for nested economies by demonstrating that communities can achieve greater prosperity through cooperation and care recognition than through competition and extraction:</p> <h3>Community-Owned Infrastructure Development</h3> <p><strong>Hearts Wallet Systems and Democratic Control</strong>:
Communities establish Hearts currency systems through community-owned digital wallets that maintain local sovereignty over monetary policy while enabling regional trade. The Oakland pilot begins with 500 community members receiving Hearts wallets preloaded with 100 Hearts each, enabling immediate circulation while communities learn system mechanics. Wallet governance operates through monthly community assemblies where residents vote on Hearts creation rates, contribution validation criteria, and integration levels with regional networks.</p> <p><strong>Technical Implementation</strong>: Hearts wallets operate through mobile applications with offline functionality for areas with limited connectivity, plus SMS-based systems for basic phone users. Community-controlled servers hosted locally ensure data sovereignty while connecting to broader Love Ledger networks for inter-community trade. Blockchain infrastructure uses Hyperledger Fabric with community-controlled validation nodes preventing external manipulation of local currency supplies.</p> <p><strong>Democratic Participation Infrastructure</strong>: Participatory budgeting platforms achieve 80% community participation through multiple engagement methods including in-person assemblies, online platforms, door-to-door canvassing, and cultural events. The “DecideTogether” platform integrates consensus-building tools, conflict resolution protocols, and transparent voting mechanisms that accommodate diverse cultural approaches to decision-making while maintaining clear outcomes.</p> <p><strong>Community Land Trust Implementation</strong>: Housing speculation reduction operates through community land trusts that maintain affordability in perpetuity while building community wealth. Oakland’s pilot establishes land trust ownership for 200 housing units with resident ownership of structures and community ownership of land, ensuring housing costs remain at 30% of median income while preventing displacement through gentrification.</p> <h3>Economic Democracy and Cooperative Development</h3> <p><strong>Worker and Multi-Stakeholder Cooperatives</strong>: Elena’s health clinic transitions to cooperative ownership with worker-owners sharing profits and governance while maintaining accountability to the broader community through Hearts currency integration. Maya’s restoration work operates through an ecological services cooperative that includes worker-owners, community representatives, and ecosystem advocates ensuring decisions serve both economic and ecological health.</p> <p><strong>Cooperative Formation Support</strong>: Communities receive comprehensive training and legal support for establishing cooperatives through template bylaws, financial planning assistance, governance training, and ongoing mentorship. Existing successful cooperatives provide peer learning networks while legal clinics help navigate regulatory frameworks that often favor corporate structures over democratic ownership.</p> <p><strong>Supply Chain Cooperation</strong>: Local cooperatives coordinate purchasing, marketing, and distribution through Hearts currency systems that keep wealth circulating locally while achieving economies of scale. Food cooperatives, worker cooperatives, and housing cooperatives create integrated networks where community prosperity reinforces rather than competes with individual enterprise success.</p> <h3>Care Economy Recognition Systems</h3> <p><strong>Proof of Care Validation</strong>: Community members earn Hearts currency for verified care contributions including childcare, elder care, disability support, mental health assistance, community organizing, and conflict resolution. Validation operates through peer recognition systems, community impact assessment, and recipient feedback ensuring authentic contribution recognition while preventing gaming.</p> <p><strong>Cultural Adaptation of Care Recognition</strong>: Different communities define care work according to their cultural values and traditions. Indigenous communities include traditional knowledge transmission and ceremonial leadership. Faith communities recognize spiritual care and pastoral support. Artistic communities value creative expression and cultural preservation. This flexibility ensures Hearts systems strengthen rather than override community values.</p> <p><strong>Care Infrastructure Development</strong>: Hearts currency enables development of community-controlled care infrastructure including childcare cooperatives, elder care networks, community gardens, tool libraries, and mutual aid systems. Rather than relying on expensive privatized services or inadequate government programs, communities build care systems that serve their specific needs and values.</p> <h3>Local Implementation Costs and Funding</h3> <p><strong>Phase 1 Investment Requirements</strong>: $1 million per pilot city over 3 years covering technology infrastructure ($300K), community training and facilitation ($400K), legal and administrative setup ($200K), and emergency support fund ($100K).
