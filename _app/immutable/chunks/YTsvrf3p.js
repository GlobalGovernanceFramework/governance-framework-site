These principles reflect the institutional authority of the <a href="/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home">Treaty for Our Only Home</a>, the wisdom and sovereignty of the <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge">Indigenous & Traditional Knowledge Governance Framework</a>, and the coordination protocols of the <a href="/frameworks/meta-governance">Integrated Meta-Governance Framework</a>. Together, they create a revolutionary foundation for climate governance that is Indigenous-led, institutionally empowered, and systematically coordinated.</p> <h2><a id="foundation-golden-triangle"></a>Foundation in the Golden Triangle Ecosystem</h2> <h3>Integrated Authority and Wisdom</h3> <p>The framework’s guiding principles are not abstract values but concrete commitments enabled by the Golden Triangle’s institutional architecture:</p> <p><strong>Treaty-Enabled Implementation</strong>: Principles gain enforcement authority through the <a href="/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars">Global Enforcement Mechanism</a>, independent funding through the <a href="/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars">Global Carbon Levy</a>, and democratic legitimacy through the <a href="/frameworks/treaty-for-our-only-home#five-pillars">Global Citizens’ Initiative</a>.</p> <p><strong>Indigenous Wisdom Leadership</strong>: Principles are guided by <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#key-mechanisms">Traditional Ecological Knowledge</a> rather than Western scientific reductionism, with Indigenous territorial sovereignty through <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components">Bioregional Autonomous Zones</a> serving as the primary governance framework.</p> <p><strong>Meta-Governance Coordination</strong>: Principles operate through the <a href="/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components">Climate & Energy Meta-Council</a> for cross-domain coordination, <a href="/frameworks/meta-governance#structural-components">24-hour crisis response protocols</a> for emergencies, and <a href="/frameworks/meta-governance#evaluation">7-Dimension Evaluation</a> for comprehensive accountability.</p> <h3>Principle Coherence Across Frameworks</h3> <p><strong>Rights of Nature Legal Foundation</strong>: All principles operate within the <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#core-principles">Rights of Nature</a> legal framework, treating ecosystems as legal persons with Indigenous communities serving as legal guardians.</p> <p><strong>Earth Council Moral Authority</strong>: The <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#structural-components">Earth Council (Kawsay Pacha)</a> provides spiritual and ethical guidance for all climate governance, ensuring principles align with Indigenous values and seventh-generation thinking.</p> <p><strong>Democratic Enhancement</strong>: Principles are accountable to enhanced democratic participation through Treaty mechanisms while maintaining Indigenous sovereignty and Traditional Knowledge authority.</p> <h2><a id="indigenous-sovereignty-tek"></a>Indigenous Sovereignty and Traditional Ecological Knowledge</h2> <h3>Traditional Knowledge as Primary Authority</h3> <p><strong>TEK-Guided Climate Science</strong>: <a href="/frameworks/indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge#key-mechanisms">Traditional Ecological Knowledge</a> serves as the foundational data source for climate modeling, adaptation strategies, and ecosystem management, with Western science providing supplementary rather than primary authority.</p> <p><strong>Indigenous Environmental Indicators</strong>: Climate governance prioritizes traditional environmental observations, seasonal calendars, and Indigenous understanding of ecosystem relationships over purely technical measurements.</p> <p><strong>Cultural Protocol Climate Integration</strong>: All climate governance processes follow traditional protocols for decision-making, ceremony, and community consultation, ensuring climate action strengthens rather than undermines Indigenous cultural practices.</p> <p><strong>Traditional Innovation Authority</strong>: Climate technology development is guided by Traditional Ecological Knowledge principles, ensuring innovations support Indigenous relationships with ecosystems rather than disrupting traditional practices.</p> <h3>Bioregional Governance and Territorial Sovereignty</h3> <p><strong>BAZ Implementation Authority</strong>: Climate and energy governance operates through <a
