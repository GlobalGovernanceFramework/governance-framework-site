As organizations mature in their practice, they discover that the most profound changes are not structural or operational, but relational—shifts in how they hold responsibility, how they engage with others on similar journeys, and how they navigate the inevitable tensions that arise when business serves not just profit, but the flourishing of all life.</p> <p>This deepening requires new forms of recognition and accountability that honor the complexity of regenerative work while providing the support and challenge necessary for continued growth. It asks us to move beyond individual enterprise transformation toward collective commitment to healing our economic system itself.</p> <p><strong>In this exploration:</strong></p> <ul><li><a href="#unfolding-path">The Unfolding Path: Exploring, Integrating, and Leading</a></li> <li><a href="#regeneration-circle">The Regeneration Circle: A Council for Recognition and Mutual Accountability</a></li> <li><a href="#right-relationship">A Commitment to Right Relationship: Pathways for Navigating Tension</a></li></ul> <hr> <h2><a id="unfolding-path"></a>The Unfolding Path: Exploring, Integrating, and Leading</h2> <p>The journey of regenerative enterprise unfolds not as a linear progression from beginner to expert, but as a spiral deepening of capacity, wisdom, and commitment. Like the growth rings of a tree, each cycle of learning contains all previous learning while expanding into new territories of possibility and responsibility.</p> <p><strong>Understanding Maturity as Deepening Relationship</strong></p> <p>Regenerative maturity isn’t measured by the number of modules implemented or certifications achieved, but by the depth and authenticity of an enterprise’s relationship with all those its work affects. A truly mature regenerative enterprise has developed what we might call “relational intelligence”—the capacity to sense and respond to the needs of the whole web of life while maintaining its own integrity and purpose.</p> <p><strong>The Exploring Phase: Learning to See</strong></p> <p><strong>Characteristics of Exploration:</strong></p> <p>The exploring phase is characterized by awakening—a growing awareness that business could be a force for healing rather than harm, accompanied by initial experiments in regenerative practices. Enterprises in this phase are learning to see their work through new eyes, recognizing interconnections they had previously ignored.</p> <p><strong>Sarah’s Story of Awakening:</strong></p> <p>Sarah Chen, founder of a sustainable fashion startup, describes her exploring phase: “I thought I was already doing good by using organic materials, but when I started asking deeper questions about our supply chain relationships, I realized how much I didn’t know about the full impact of our work.”</p> <p>Her exploration began with simple practices: conducting a stakeholder mapping exercise that revealed the breadth of people and places affected by their enterprise, implementing a worker feedback system that gave voice to previously unheard concerns, and beginning to track not just financial metrics but employee wellbeing and supplier relationship health.</p> <p>“The most important shift was learning to ask different questions. Instead of ‘How can we optimize this process?’ I started asking ‘How can this process serve the flourishing of everyone it touches?‘”</p> <p><strong>Gifts of the Exploring Phase:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Beginner’s mind</strong> that sees possibilities invisible to more experienced but habituated perspectives</li> <li><strong>Fresh enthusiasm</strong> that can inspire others and overcome initial resistance</li> <li><strong>Willingness to experiment</strong> without being constrained by “how things are supposed to work”</li> <li><strong>Authentic uncertainty</strong> that invites collaboration and learning from others</li></ul> <p><strong>Gentle Invitations for Explorers:</strong></p> <p>Rather than pushing toward rapid implementation, exploring enterprises are invited to:</p> <ul><li><strong>Practice deep listening</strong> to stakeholders whose voices have been marginalized or ignored</li> <li><strong>Experiment with single practices</strong> from different modules to discover what resonates with their culture and context</li> <li><strong>Join learning communities</strong> where they can share questions and discoveries with other exploring enterprises</li> <li><strong>Document their journey</strong> not as success stories but as learning stories that can guide others</li></ul> <p><strong>The Integrating Phase: Learning to Weave</strong></p> <p><strong>Characteristics of Integration:</strong></p> <p>The integrating phase is marked by weaving—the growing capacity to see how different regenerative practices connect and reinforce each other. Enterprises in this phase are learning to hold complexity, balancing multiple stakeholder needs while maintaining operational effectiveness.</p> <p><strong>Marcus’s Story of Integration:</strong></p> <p>Marcus Rodriguez, CEO of a mid-sized manufacturing company, entered the integrating phase after several years of regenerative experimentation. “We had successfully implemented practices from three different modules, but they felt like separate initiatives rather than an integrated approach to business.”</p> <p>His integration work focused on understanding the connections: how their Digital Product Passport system (Module 2) supported their stakeholder governance processes (Module 1), how their Hearts currency implementation (Module 3) enhanced their workplace culture transformation (Module 4), and how all of these changes positioned them for industry leadership (Module 5).</p> <p>“Integration wasn’t about doing more things—it was about understanding how everything we were doing served the same deeper purpose of aligning our business with life.”</p> <p><strong>Gifts of the Integrating Phase:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Systems thinking</strong> that sees how changes in one area affect all others</li> <li><strong>Balancing capacity</strong> that can hold multiple stakeholder needs in dynamic tension</li> <li><strong>Strategic patience</strong> that allows complex changes to unfold at their natural pace</li> <li><strong>Mentoring wisdom</strong> gained through navigating the challenges of implementation</li></ul> <p><strong>Gentle Invitations for Integrators:</strong></p> <p>Integrating enterprises are invited to:</p> <ul><li><strong>Map the connections</strong> between their various regenerative practices to understand emergent patterns</li> <li><strong>Develop stakeholder feedback loops</strong> that provide ongoing guidance for balancing competing needs</li> <li><strong>Share their learning</strong> with exploring enterprises through mentoring relationships</li> <li><strong>Collaborate with peers</strong> in their industry or bioregion to amplify collective impact</li></ul> <p><strong>The Leading Phase: Learning to Serve</strong></p> <p><strong>Characteristics of Leadership:</strong></p> <p>The leading phase is distinguished by service—the capacity to use one’s own transformation as a foundation for supporting the transformation of others. Enterprises in this phase have developed sufficient internal stability and wisdom to become catalysts for broader regenerative change.</p> <p><strong>Maria’s Story of Service:</strong></p> <p>Maria Gonzalez leads a cooperative network that has evolved into a regional force for regenerative economic development. “We realized that our individual success would be limited if the entire ecosystem remained extractive. True success meant helping transform the whole system.”</p> <p>Her leadership work includes: mentoring other enterprises in regenerative transformation, advocating for policy changes that support regenerative business practices, sharing innovations through open-source approaches, and convening industry conversations about collective transformation.</p> <p>“Leadership in regenerative enterprise isn’t about being the best or biggest—it’s about using whatever capacity you’ve developed to support the flourishing of the whole movement.”</p> <p><strong>Gifts of the Leading Phase:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Ecosystem awareness</strong> that sees individual enterprise success as inseparable from collective wellbeing</li> <li><strong>Generative influence</strong> that catalyzes transformation in other enterprises and systems</li> <li><strong>Humble confidence</strong> rooted in experience rather than theory</li> <li><strong>Sacred responsibility</strong> for supporting the emergence of a regenerative economy</li></ul> <p><strong>Gentle Invitations for Leaders:</strong></p> <p>Leading enterprises are invited to:</p> <ul><li><strong>Mentor other enterprises</strong> through their transformation journeys without imposing their specific approaches</li> <li><strong>Advocate for systemic changes</strong> in policy, finance, and culture that support regenerative business practices</li> <li><strong>Share intellectual property</strong> and innovations through commons approaches that accelerate collective learning</li> <li><strong>Hold space</strong> for difficult conversations about the challenges and complexities of regenerative transformation</li></ul> <p><strong>The Spiral Nature of Deepening</strong></p> <p>It’s important to understand that these phases are not linear stages but recurring cycles of deepening. An enterprise that has achieved leadership in one area may find itself in exploration mode when entering new territories of regenerative practice. A company that has integrated multiple modules may return to exploration when facing new challenges or opportunities.</p> <p><strong>The Gift of Returning</strong></p> <p>Each return to earlier phases brings new wisdom and capacity. An enterprise that explores workplace culture transformation after years of operational and governance work brings depth of relationship and systems understanding that wasn’t available in their initial exploration. A company that re-examines its governance structures after developing ecosystem leadership capacity can integrate insights about collective transformation that weren’t visible during their initial governance work.</p> <p><strong>Questions for Reflection:</strong></p> <ul><li>Which phase feels most descriptive of your current capacity and focus?</li> <li>What gifts does your current phase offer to others on the regenerative journey?</li> <li>Where do you sense the invitation to deepen or expand your regenerative practice?</li> <li>How might your individual transformation serve the broader transformation of your industry or bioregion?</li></ul> <hr> <h2><a id="regeneration-circle"></a>The Regeneration Circle: A Council for Recognition and Mutual Accountability</h2> <p>True regenerative transformation cannot happen in isolation. It requires community—others who share the commitment to aligning enterprise with life and who can provide the support, challenge, and accountability necessary for sustained growth. The Regeneration Circle offers a framework for this collective work of recognition and mutual support.</p> <p><strong>Beyond Certification to Relationship</strong></p> <p>Traditional certification processes focus on compliance with external standards, measuring whether enterprises meet predetermined criteria. The Regeneration Circle approach recognizes that regenerative transformation is too complex and contextual for standardized measurement. Instead, it emphasizes relationship—ongoing engagement with peers who can witness, support, and challenge each other’s journey toward greater alignment with life.</p> <p><strong>The Philosophy of Mutual Accountability</strong></p> <p>Mutual accountability is based on the understanding that we are all learning to align business with life, and none of us has perfected this practice. Rather than judging whether enterprises meet static standards, mutual accountability asks: Are you growing in your capacity to serve life? Are you learning from your mistakes? Are you contributing to collective understanding and transformation?</p> <p><strong>Elena’s Experience with Circle Practice:</strong></p> <p>Elena Martinez, who leads a sustainable packaging company, describes her experience: “I initially approached regenerative business like I was trying to pass an exam—checking boxes and meeting standards. The Regeneration Circle helped me understand that this is a lifelong practice of deepening relationship and learning.”</p> <p>Her circle includes a urban agriculture cooperative, a renewable energy startup, a traditional Indigenous enterprise, and a division of a larger corporation. “We’re all in completely different industries with different challenges, but we share the commitment to making business serve life. That shared intention creates space for the honest conversations that real transformation requires.”</p> <p><strong>The Structure of Recognition and Support</strong></p> <p><strong>Forming Circles:</strong></p> <p>Regeneration Circles are typically composed of 4-6 enterprises at various stages of regenerative transformation. Diversity of industry, size, and cultural background often strengthens circles by bringing different perspectives to common challenges.</p> <p>Circles form through:</p> <ul><li><strong>Natural relationships</strong> between enterprises that have discovered each other through supply chains, shared geography, or common values</li> <li><strong>Facilitated connections</strong> through regenerative business networks and communities of practice</li> <li><strong>Industry-specific cohorts</strong> that bring together enterprises facing similar sector challenges</li> <li><strong>Cross-sector learning groups</strong> that explore how regenerative principles translate across different types of work</li></ul> <p><strong>Circle Practices:</strong></p> <p><strong>Storytelling Sessions:</strong> Regular gatherings where each enterprise shares their current challenges, discoveries, and questions without pressure to present success or defend choices.</p> <p><strong>Peer Learning Exchanges:</strong> Visits to each other’s operations to witness regenerative practices in action and offer perspective on challenges and opportunities.</p> <p><strong>Accountability Partnerships:</strong> Ongoing support relationships where enterprises commit to specific practices or explorations and provide each other with gentle accountability for following through.</p> <p><strong>Collective Reflection:</strong> Quarterly sessions where circles explore what they’re learning about regenerative transformation and how their insights might serve the broader movement.</p> <p><strong>The Practice of Recognition</strong></p> <p>Recognition in Regeneration Circles isn’t about awarding credentials or ranking performance. It’s about witnessing and acknowledging the depth of commitment, the quality of learning, and the contribution to collective transformation.</p> <p><strong>Three Dimensions of Recognition:</strong></p> <p><strong>Commitment to Learning:</strong> How deeply is the enterprise engaging with the ongoing work of aligning business with life? Are they asking hard questions, experimenting with new approaches, and learning from both successes and failures?</p> <p><strong>Quality of Relationship:</strong> How authentic and caring are the enterprise’s relationships with all stakeholders? Are they creating conditions for genuine flourishing, or are regenerative practices more performative than transformative?</p> <p><strong>Contribution to Collective Transformation:</strong> How is the enterprise using its learning and capacity to support the broader regenerative movement? Are they sharing knowledge, mentoring others, and working for systemic change?</p> <p><strong>David’s Recognition Story:</strong></p> <p>David Kim, who leads a worker-owned consulting firm, describes his experience of recognition: “I expected it to be like performance review—someone evaluating whether we were doing regenerative business correctly. Instead, it was like being seen and appreciated for the depth of our commitment and the authenticity of our relationships.”</p> <p>His circle recognized his enterprise not for perfect implementation of modules, but for their willingness to address difficult questions about power and equity in workplace culture, their innovative approaches to sharing ownership with workers, and their mentoring of other enterprises exploring cooperative models.</p> <p>“The recognition wasn’t about being the best—it was about being witnessed in our dedication to continuous learning and service.”</p> <p><strong>Holding Space for Difficulty</strong></p> <p>One of the most important functions of Regeneration Circles is providing support during difficult periods when regenerative commitments are tested by financial pressure, stakeholder conflict, or internal resistance.</p> <p><strong>Grace’s Challenge:</strong></p> <p>Grace Thompson’s social impact consulting firm faced a crisis when a major client demanded that they stop using Hearts currency recognition for care work because it “complicated billing and accountability.” The client represented 40% of their revenue, and losing them would require laying off staff.</p> <p>Her Regeneration Circle didn’t provide easy answers, but they offered something more valuable: space to explore the tension between financial survival and regenerative commitment without judgment or pressure to choose a specific response.</p> <p>“They helped me see that there wasn’t a ‘right’ answer, but there were ways to navigate the situation that honored both our survival needs and our deeper commitments,” Grace reflects. “We ended up finding a middle path that maintained our Hearts practices while adapting our client relationship approach.”</p> <p><strong>The Circle of Accountability Questions</strong></p> <p>Rather than external audits, Regeneration Circles use ongoing questions that each enterprise explores with support from their peers:</p> <p><strong>Learning Questions:</strong></p> <ul><li>What are you discovering about what it means to align business with life?</li> <li>Where are you being challenged to grow in your regenerative practice?</li> <li>What mistakes are you learning from, and how are you sharing that learning?</li></ul> <p><strong>Relationship Questions:</strong></p> <ul><li>How are your stakeholder relationships deepening and becoming more authentic?</li> <li>Where are you being called to include voices that have been marginalized?</li> <li>What does flourishing look like for all those your work affects?</li></ul> <p><strong>Service Questions:</strong></p> <ul><li>How is your transformation contributing to collective regenerative change?</li> <li>What knowledge and resources are you sharing with others on this journey?</li> <li>How are you using your influence to support systemic transformation?</li></ul> <p><strong>The Evolution of Recognition</strong></p> <p>As Regeneration Circles mature, they often evolve from focus on individual enterprise transformation toward collective work for systemic change. Circles begin collaborating on policy advocacy, shared infrastructure development, and industry transformation initiatives.</p> <p><strong>The Great Lakes Regeneration Circle:</strong></p> <p>A circle of enterprises around the Great Lakes has evolved into a bioregional network focused on watershed restoration and regenerative economic development. They’ve jointly developed supply chain networks that keep wealth circulating within their bioregion, created shared infrastructure for renewable energy and waste processing, and successfully advocated for policy changes that support regenerative business practices.</p> <p>“Individual transformation was just the beginning,” reflects circle member James Wilson. “The real work is transforming the entire economic ecosystem to support life rather than extract from it.”</p> <p><strong>Questions for Reflection:</strong></p> <ul><li>What kind of support and accountability would most serve your regenerative journey?</li> <li>Who might be natural partners for mutual accountability and learning?</li> <li>How might collective recognition serve the broader movement for regenerative transformation?</li> <li>What would it mean to measure success by contribution to collective flourishing rather than individual achievement?</li></ul> <hr> <h2><a id="right-relationship"></a>A Commitment to Right Relationship: Pathways for Navigating Tension</h2> <p>The journey of regenerative enterprise inevitably involves navigating tensions—between financial sustainability and social impact, between rapid growth and stakeholder wellbeing, between individual enterprise success and collective transformation. Rather than seeing these tensions as problems to solve, regenerative practice invites us to hold them as generative polarities that can deepen our wisdom and strengthen our commitment to serving life.</p> <p><strong>Understanding Tension as Sacred Work</strong></p> <p>Traditional business training teaches us to resolve tensions quickly and definitively. Regenerative practice asks us to develop capacity to hold tension with grace, recognizing that the most important questions don’t have simple answers and that the process of wrestling with complexity often generates more wisdom than premature resolution.</p> <p><strong>The Art of Both/And Thinking</strong></p> <p>Indigenous wisdom traditions speak of “walking in balance”—the capacity to honor multiple truths simultaneously without needing to choose one over another. This both/and thinking becomes essential in regenerative enterprise, where success requires serving financial sustainability AND social justice, individual autonomy AND collective responsibility, local community AND global connection.</p> <p><strong>Common Tensions and Pathways for Navigation</strong></p> <p><strong>The Profitability and Purpose Paradox</strong></p> <p><strong>The Tension:</strong> How do we maintain financial viability while refusing to compromise on regenerative commitments that may increase costs or reduce short-term profits?</p> <p><strong>Navigating with Wisdom:</strong></p> <p><strong>Redefining Profitability:</strong> Many enterprises discover that long-term profitability actually increases when they include stakeholder and ecosystem health in their definition of success. Interface Inc.’s experience demonstrates how regenerative practices can reduce costs while improving market position.</p> <p><strong>Timeline Consciousness:</strong> Understanding that regenerative transformation often requires upfront investment for long-term returns helps enterprises weather periods where purpose and immediate profitability seem to conflict.</p> <p><strong>Stakeholder Partnership:</strong> Engaging customers, investors, and suppliers in the transformation journey often reveals ways to align financial sustainability with regenerative impact that weren’t visible when working in isolation.</p> <p><strong>Maria’s Navigation:</strong> Maria Santos at Lifeforce Foods faced this tension when implementing living wage policies that increased labor costs by 25%. “We could have seen this as a profitability problem, but instead we saw it as an innovation challenge. How could we create more value to support better compensation?”</p> <p>Her enterprise developed premium product lines that commanded higher prices due to verified social and ecological benefits, created efficiency improvements through worker engagement and retention, and accessed new markets that valued their regenerative approach. “Profitability improved because we were creating more real value, not extracting more value from others.”</p> <p><strong>The Growth and Relationship Dilemma</strong></p> <p><strong>The Tension:</strong> How do we scale our regenerative impact without losing the authentic relationships and community connections that are essential to our mission?</p> <p><strong>Navigating with Wisdom:</strong></p> <p><strong>Organic Growth Models:</strong> Many regenerative enterprises choose growth patterns that mirror natural systems—gradual, relationship-based expansion that maintains connection to place and community rather than rapid scaling that sacrifices relationship for reach.</p> <p><strong>Network Approaches:</strong> Instead of growing larger as individual enterprises, many regenerative businesses grow through networks and partnerships that amplify impact while maintaining human scale and community connection.</p> <p><strong>Steward-Ownership Structures:</strong> Legal structures that protect mission from growth pressure enable enterprises to choose growth strategies that serve their regenerative commitments rather than external investor expectations.</p> <p><strong>Carlos’s Approach:</strong> Carlos Mendez’s urban agriculture network faced pressure to expand rapidly to meet demand for locally grown food. “We could have opened large facilities in distant markets, but that would have contradicted our commitment to bioregional food systems and worker ownership.”</p> <p>Instead, they developed a franchise model that supports community members in other cities to start their own cooperatively-owned growing operations, sharing knowledge and resources while maintaining local control and ownership. “We’re growing our impact without growing our hierarchy.”</p> <p><strong>The Individual and Collective Balance</strong></p> <p><strong>The Tension:</strong> How do we maintain the autonomy and innovation capacity that makes our enterprise effective while participating in collective transformation efforts that require coordination and shared commitment?</p> <p><strong>Navigating with Wisdom:</strong></p> <p><strong>Nested Sovereignty:</strong> Understanding individual enterprise autonomy as nested within larger systems enables decisions that serve both individual mission and collective wellbeing.</p> <p><strong>Shared Standards, Diverse Strategies:</strong> Participating in collective commitments to regenerative principles while maintaining flexibility in how those principles are implemented allows for both coordination and innovation.</p> <p><strong>Leadership Rotation:</strong> Many regenerative networks rotate leadership responsibilities so that collective coordination doesn’t become a burden on any single enterprise while ensuring sustained direction.</p> <p><strong>Jennifer’s Experience:</strong> Jennifer Park’s renewable energy cooperative struggled with balancing individual decision-making autonomy with collective commitments to other cooperatives in their network. “We wanted to maintain our independence while also supporting network-wide initiatives that none of us could achieve alone.”</p> <p>They developed a governance structure where individual cooperatives maintain autonomy over daily operations while sharing decision-making authority over network-wide strategies and resource allocation. “We discovered that shared authority in some areas actually increased our individual autonomy by creating collective capacity we couldn’t develop alone.”</p> <p><strong>The Local and Global Connection</strong></p> <p><strong>The Tension:</strong> How do we serve our local community and bioregion while also addressing global challenges that require coordinated response across geographical boundaries?</p> <p><strong>Navigating with Wisdom:</strong></p> <p><strong>Bioregional Focus with Global Consciousness:</strong> Many enterprises choose to focus their direct work on their local bioregion while connecting with similar enterprises globally to share learning and coordinate larger-scale initiatives.</p> <p><strong>Supply Chain Justice:</strong> Using global supply chain relationships to support regenerative transformation in other bioregions while maintaining primary commitment to local community and ecosystem health.</p> <p><strong>Knowledge Commons:</strong> Contributing innovations and learning to global commons while adapting global knowledge to local contexts and needs.</p> <p><strong>Michael’s Integration:</strong> Michael Chen’s sustainable manufacturing company struggled with balancing local community commitments with supply chain relationships that spanned multiple continents. “We wanted to serve our local community while also supporting regenerative transformation in the communities where our materials come from.”</p> <p>They developed supply chain partnerships based on regenerative principles, investing in supplier community development and environmental restoration while maintaining their local focus. “We realized that serving our local place well required caring for all the places our work touches.”</p> <p><strong>Practical Tools for Tension Navigation</strong></p> <p><strong>The Both/And Practice:</strong></p> <p>When facing apparent either/or choices, explicitly explore both/and possibilities:</p> <ul><li>Instead of “Should we prioritize profitability OR social impact?” ask “How might we serve profitability AND social impact?”</li> <li>Instead of “Should we focus on local OR global concerns?” ask “How might we serve local wellbeing AND global transformation?”</li></ul> <p><strong>The Seven Generation Question:</strong></p> <p>When immediate pressures conflict with long-term commitments, ask: “What would our seven-generation descendants want us to prioritize? How can we honor both immediate needs and long-term responsibility?”</p> <p><strong>The Stakeholder Circle Practice:</strong></p> <p>When tensions arise, convene affected stakeholders to explore the tension together rather than trying to resolve it in isolation. Often the wisdom for navigation emerges from collective exploration rather than individual analysis.</p> <p><strong>The Pause and Deepen Protocol:</strong></p> <p>When tensions feel overwhelming or urgent resolution seems necessary, practice pausing to ask: “What is this tension teaching us? How might holding this complexity longer generate wisdom we wouldn’t access through quick resolution?”</p> <p><strong>Questions for Reflection:</strong></p> <ul><li>What tensions are you currently navigating in your regenerative journey?</li> <li>How might these tensions be generative rather than problematic?</li> <li>What support do you need to hold complexity with grace rather than rushing toward premature resolution?</li> <li>How might collective exploration of tensions serve both your individual enterprise and the broader regenerative movement?</li></ul> <p><strong>The Gift of Unresolved Questions</strong></p> <p>Perhaps the greatest gift of regenerative enterprise is learning to live and work with profound questions rather than simple answers. In a world that demands quick solutions and clear metrics, choosing to hold complexity with patience and wisdom becomes a radical act of faith in the possibility of business that serves life rather than consuming it.</p> <p>The tensions we navigate in regenerative enterprise are not obstacles to overcome but teachers that can deepen our capacity for wisdom, compassion, and service. They invite us into the ongoing work of becoming enterprises worthy of the trust of all those our work affects—including the generations yet to come.</p> <hr> <p><em>This completes our exploration of deepening regenerative practice through maturity, recognition, and relationship. The path forward is not about achieving perfection but about cultivating the capacity to serve life with greater wisdom, authenticity, and love through the ongoing work of enterprise transformation.</em></p>',1);function c(e){var t=r();o(320),i(e,t)}export{c as default};
