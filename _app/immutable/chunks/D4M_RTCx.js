The <code>AUBI</code>, <code>Financial Systems</code>, and <code>Moral Operating System</code> frameworks define the core logic for how Hearts, Leaves, the Love Ledger, and rights management will function. They are the “physics” of your ecosystem.</li> <li><strong>Key Actions:</strong> <ul><li>Focus all energy on getting these three frameworks to an A++ “Ready” status.</li> <li>Ensure their internal logic is flawless and consistent. For example, the conversion rate of care hours to Hearts must be clearly defined in the <code>Financial Systems</code> framework before anyone can design the Love Ledger app.</li> <li>The <code>Moral Operating System</code>’s <code>Dynamic Rights Spectrum</code> must be fully articulated, as it will define the permissions in the back-end systems.</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Create Detailed Technical Specifications for One Pilot Application:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Why:</strong> Instead of building a tool, the goal is to create a “ready-to-build” specification document that a future developer or technical partner can pick up and immediately understand.</li> <li><strong>Key Actions:</strong> <ul><li>Choose the first application to be built. My recommendation remains the <strong>Love Ledger</strong> interface for the <strong>“Community Consent Guide”</strong>.</li> <li>Draft a detailed technical specification document for this app. It should include: <ul><li>User stories (e.g., “As an Indigenous elder, I want to log my consent…“)</li> <li>Data schema (what information is stored, how it’s structured).</li> <li>API requirements (how it will interact with a future <code>Hearts</code> ledger).</li> <li>UI/UX wireframes (simple, hand-drawn-style mockups are sufficient).</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Standardize the Architecture of All Existing Frameworks:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Why:</strong> To ensure consistency and make the entire system easier to understand for new contributors, partners, and funders.</li> <li><strong>Key Actions:</strong> <ul><li>Continue the excellent work of revising all frameworks to the high standard of the Aethelred Accord, with the layered structure, standard appendices, and deep cross-integration. This makes the entire project look and feel cohesive and professional.</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Finalize All Tier 1 Frameworks to “Ready” Status:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Why:</strong> Tier 1 addresses “Urgent Global Stability & Justice”. Having a complete and robust set of solutions for these pressing issues is critical for the project’s credibility and immediate relevance.</li> <li><strong>Key Actions:</strong> <ul><li>Systematically review and revise all frameworks currently in the “review” stage (e.g., <code>indigenous-governance-and-traditional-knowledge</code>, <code>climate-and-energy-governance</code>, <code>gaian-trade-framework</code>) to the A++ standard of the Aethelred Accord, ensuring deep integration with the Treaty, MOS, and AUBI systems.</li> <li>Begin drafting the “planned” Tier 1 frameworks, starting with the <code>global-health-and-pandemic-security</code> framework, given its urgency.</li> <li>Ensure every framework has the complete set of standard appendices (e.g., Crisis Response, Opposition Matrix, Implementation Toolkit).</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Develop One Complete, Actionable Implementation Toolkit:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Why:</strong> To move from theory to practice and provide a tangible product for partners. This demonstrates that the frameworks are not just ideas, but operational guides.</li> <li><strong>Key Actions:</strong> <ul><li>Select one high-impact toolkit from an existing framework. A strong candidate would be the <strong>“Community Consent Guide”</strong> from the Aethelred Accord, as it is foundational for multiple other frameworks.</li> <li>Develop it fully, including templates, facilitation guides, and multimedia educational materials, making it ready for a pilot in a partner community or BAZ.</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Establish the “Genetic Governance Stack” as a Public Asset:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Why:</strong> The Aethelred Accord contains a “Genetic Governance Stack Diagram” which is a powerful visual and conceptual tool. Formalizing and publishing this can position the GGF as a thought leader in biotech governance.</li> <li><strong>Key Actions:</strong> <ul><li>Commission a professional, interactive version of the diagram for the website, as specified in Appendix L of the Accord.</li> <li>Write 2-3 accompanying articles explaining how the stack integrates legal, ethical, and community oversight.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol> <h2><strong>Initial Goals: Ecosystem Lab</strong></h2> <ol><li><p><strong>Recruit One Founding Technical Partner or Contributor:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Why:</strong> This is the <strong>single most critical goal.</strong> The project needs a technical co-lead to oversee the development of the GGF’s software infrastructure. You cannot and should not do it alone.</li> <li><strong>Key Actions:</strong> <ul><li>Actively search for a senior, full-stack developer who is passionate about open-source, ethical tech, and decentralized systems.</li> <li>Create a compelling “Call for a Technical Co-Founder” document that outlines the vision and the opportunity.</li> <li>Target communities where such individuals gather (e.g., open-source foundations, effective altruism forums, Web3/decentralized tech projects).</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Secure Seed Funding with a Focus on Technical Development:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Why:</strong> Your first major funding goal should be to secure enough capital to hire a freelance developer or bring on a part-time technical lead.</li> <li><strong>Key Actions:</strong> <ul><li>Refine your pitch to funders. With the finalized “Core Logic” frameworks and a detailed technical specification for the first app, you can now say: “We have the complete blueprint. We need X funding to build the first room of the house.”</li> <li>Target grants and philanthropies that focus on open-source technology for social good. Your robust, non-coded frameworks are a huge asset here, as they prove the depth of your planning.</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Establish a Strategic Technical Partnership:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Why:</strong> A partnership can provide not just funding, but also invaluable technical expertise and infrastructure.</li> <li><strong>Key Actions:</strong> <ul><li>Identify organizations that could be technical partners. This might be a university’s computer science department, a non-profit focused on open-source software, or an established company in the ethical tech space.</li> <li>The goal of the partnership would be to collaborate on building the first prototype of the Love Ledger or another core component.</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Onboard the First 50 Active Contributors:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Why:</strong> This directly aligns with the Year 1 milestone in the GGF-OS Maturity Roadmap. A project this ambitious can only succeed with a vibrant community.</li> <li><strong>Key Actions:</strong> <ul><li>Create clear “Contributor Journey” pathways, as outlined in the GGF-OS, for different roles (writers, developers, community managers, legal experts).</li> <li>Actively recruit founding contributors for the “planned” frameworks, starting with a lead for the <code>global-health-and-pandemic-security</code> lab.</li> <li>Launch a regular communication channel (e.g., a newsletter or monthly community call) to keep contributors engaged and informed.</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Secure Initial Seed Funding via OpenCollective:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Why:</strong> To cover essential operational costs (legal registration, hosting, software licenses) and to live the principle of Radical Transparency from day one.</li> <li><strong>Key Actions:</strong> <ul><li>Set up and promote an OpenCollective page for the “GGF Catalyst.”</li> <li>Establish a clear and modest initial fundraising target (e.g., €15,000 / 150,000 SEK) to build momentum and demonstrate financial viability to larger grant-making institutions.</li> <li>Draft the first “Reform Impact Bond” proposal, as mentioned in the GGF-OS, to present to potential funders.</li></ul></li></ul></li> <li><p><strong>Launch One Strategic Partnership:</strong></p> <ul><li><strong>Why:</strong> Partnerships provide validation, resources, and real-world testing grounds for the frameworks.</li> <li><strong>Key Actions:</strong> <ul><li>Identify and formally engage one “pilot partner.” This could be a BAZ-aligned Indigenous community, a municipality interested in <code>Hearts</code> currency (like Bristol, UK), or a university’s public policy department.</li> <li>Co-develop a pilot project with this partner, for example, implementing the “Community Consent Guide” or testing a simplified version of the LMCI.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ol> <hr>",1);function c(e){var t=r();n(14),o(e,t)}export{c as default};
