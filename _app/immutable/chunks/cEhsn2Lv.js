These objectives demonstrate how coordinated governance transforms food systems from extraction to regeneration through sovereignty bargains, Bioregional Autonomous Zones, and polycentric coordination that addresses climate, biodiversity, equity, and hunger simultaneously rather than through fragmented approaches.</p> <h2><a id="golden-triangle-coordination-architecture"></a>Golden Triangle Coordination Architecture</h2> <p><strong>Food Systems Coordination Council</strong>: The primary meta-governance body integrating agriculture with water, climate, economic, and social domains through <strong>polycentric coordination</strong> that respects subsidiarity while enabling planetary-scale coordination. The Council operates through:</p> <ul><li><strong>Treaty Integration</strong>: Sovereignty bargain representatives from agricultural powers (US, EU, Brazil, China) with enhanced roles contingent on regenerative transition commitments and Indigenous sovereignty recognition</li> <li><strong>Indigenous Leadership</strong>: 50% representation from Bioregional Autonomous Zones with Traditional Ecological Knowledge authority and veto power over decisions affecting traditional territories</li> <li><strong>Youth Authority</strong>: Next-generation food system leaders with binding authority over long-term agricultural policies and seven-generation impact assessment requirements</li> <li><strong>Crisis Coordination</strong>: 24-hour activation protocols for food system emergencies integrating supply chain, nutrition, economic, and climate response</li></ul> <p><strong>Cross-Domain Integration Protocols</strong>: <strong>Dynamic interoperability</strong> mechanisms enabling agriculture, water, climate, health, and economic policies to coordinate while maintaining domain expertise and local autonomy:</p> <ul><li><strong>Agricultural-Climate Coordination</strong>: Carbon
