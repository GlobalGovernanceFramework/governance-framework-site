Village elders knew forest patterns that predicted disease emergence, traditional healers recognized symptom patterns that biomedical systems missed, and community networks could track social transmission patterns invisible to external epidemiologists. Yet no technology existed to honor this knowledge while enabling rapid global coordination. The Operational Systems of the Global Health & Pandemic Security Framework emerge from this recognition: effective pandemic response requires technological infrastructure that serves community sovereignty rather than replacing it, that integrates traditional knowledge rather than ignoring it, and that enhances rather than undermines the human relationships that constitute community health.</em></p> <h2><a id="systems-planetary-sensory"></a>Systems as Planetary Sensory Networks</h2> <h3>Distributed Intelligence Architecture</h3> <p>The operational systems function as
