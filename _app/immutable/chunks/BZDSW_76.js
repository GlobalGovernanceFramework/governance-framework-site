That’s the vision of the Adaptive Universal Basic Income (AUBI).</p> <h4><strong>What is it?</strong> 💖</h4> <p>A new kind of economic system that provides a <strong>safety net</strong> for everyone, while also acting as a <strong>launching pad</strong> for you to contribute your unique gifts to the world.</p> <h4><strong>How Do You Participate?</strong> 🤝</h4> <p>It’s a simple, four-layer system designed to recognize all types of value:</p> <ul><li><strong>Layer 1: Your Foundation to Live.</strong> 🏠
You receive a universal baseline income to cover essential needs with dignity. No strings attached.</li> <li><strong>Layer 2: Your Chance to Contribute.</strong> ✨
You can earn extra by doing meaningful work—caring for an elder, restoring a local forest, teaching a skill, or creating art.</li> <li><strong>Layer 3: Your Right to Fairness.</strong> ⚖️
The system provides extra support to repair historical injustices and help those with greater needs, like caregivers or people with disabilities.</li> <li><strong>Layer 0: Your Community’s Heartbeat.</strong> ❤️
We honor the simple acts of kindness, wisdom, and connection that can’t be measured but hold our communities together.</li></ul> <h4><strong>How Does it Work?</strong> 🌍</h4> <ul><li><strong>New Kinds of Money:</strong> We use <strong>Hearts (<code>♥</code>)</strong> to reward care and community work, and <strong>Leaves (<code>🍃</code>)</strong> to reward healing the planet.</li> <li><strong>Community Governed:</strong> This isn’t a top-down system. It’s guided by local communities and Indigenous leaders through the <strong>Social Resilience Council</strong>.</li> <li><strong>Our Goal:</strong> To move beyond measuring “stuff” (GDP) and start measuring what really matters: <strong>Love, Meaning, and Connection (LMCI)</strong>.</li></ul> <p><strong>AUBI is our plan to build an economy where everyone doesn’t just survive, they flourish.</strong></p>`,1);function g(e){var o=s();r(18),n(e,o)}export{g as default};
