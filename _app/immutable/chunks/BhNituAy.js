This approach recognizes that justice transformation cannot be imposed according to arbitrary schedules but must emerge through community readiness, institutional capacity, and ecosystem integration.</p> <p>The implementation model draws from the <strong>Meta-Governance Framework’s</strong> polycentric coordination principles, respecting that different regions and communities will progress at different rates while maintaining global coherence through shared standards and mutual support. It integrates with the <strong>Indigenous Framework’s</strong> seasonal and ceremonial timing, recognizing that meaningful transformation must align with cultural protocols and community decision-making processes.</p> <p><strong>Prerequisite Milestone Architecture</strong> ensures that each phase builds solid foundations before advancing to more complex implementation challenges. Rather than arbitrary timeline targets, each phase requires demonstration of specific capabilities, community acceptance levels, and institutional functionality before progression. <strong>Adaptive Timeline Management</strong> enables regions and communities to advance through phases at their own pace while providing additional support for those facing implementation challenges.</p> <p><strong>Ecosystem Integration Sequencing</strong> coordinates justice system implementation with the broader GGF development timeline, ensuring that justice institutions can effectively enforce <strong>MOS rights</strong>, implement <strong>Treaty obligations</strong>, resolve <strong>AUBI disputes</strong>, and coordinate with <strong>Peace & Conflict Resolution</strong> and <strong>Shield Protocol</strong> frameworks as they become operational.</p> <h2><a id="phase-1-foundation"></a>Phase 1: Foundation and Constitutional Integration (12-24 months)</h2> <p>Phase 1 establishes the constitutional and institutional foundations necessary for global justice transformation, focusing on legal authority, institutional establishment, and initial stakeholder alignment rather than operational service delivery.</p> <h3>Critical Prerequisites for Phase Initiation</h3> <p><strong>Treaty Ratification Milestone</strong>: Implementation cannot begin until the <strong>Treaty for Our Only Home’s Pillar 3 (Strengthening Global Law & Enforcement)</strong> achieves ratification by <strong>minimum 60 UN member states representing at least 50% of global population</strong>, including <strong>minimum 15 Global South nations</strong> and <strong>formal endorsement by 75% of recognized Indigenous governments</strong>. This threshold ensures sufficient legal authority and legitimacy for global justice institution establishment.</p> <p><strong>MOS Rights Framework Adoption</strong>: <strong>Moral Operating System’s Dynamic Rights Spectrum</strong> must achieve <strong>formal recognition by 50+ nations</strong> through constitutional amendment, legislative adoption, or executive decree, with <strong>demonstrated implementation mechanisms</strong> for rights protection across all consciousness tiers. <strong>Indigenous Rights Recognition</strong> requires specific acknowledgment of Traditional Knowledge sovereignty and BAZ territorial authority.</p> <p><strong>Funding Security Verification</strong>: <strong>Global Commons Fund</strong> revenue streams must demonstrate <strong>minimum $1.2 billion annual capacity</strong> through verified carbon tax, financial transaction tax, and digital services tax implementation by Treaty signatory nations, with <strong>50% equity allocation guarantee</strong> for Global South and Indigenous community implementation support.</p> <h3>Core Phase 1 Deliverables and Timelines</h3> <p><strong>Global Justice Oversight Body Establishment (Months
