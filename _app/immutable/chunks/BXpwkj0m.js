In counting the health of our relationships with each other and our planetary home, we discover what truly matters for the flourishing of all life.”</em></p></blockquote> <p>The Gaian Trade Framework employs comprehensive monitoring and evaluation systems that track progress across ecological, social, cultural, and economic dimensions while ensuring accountability to affected communities rather than distant institutions. These systems measure not just the absence of harm, but the presence of healing—tracking how trade actively regenerates ecosystems, strengthens communities, and honors traditional wisdom.</p> <h2>Key
