By mandating that any resource use be <strong>consented to, necessary, stewarded as a commons, legally accountable, and radically transparent</strong>, the framework builds a multi-layered defense against exploitation.</p> <p>This system is more than just a set of rules; it is the foundation for a new, regenerative material culture. It creates a world where the story of our products is not one of hidden harm, but one of transparent, respectful, and reciprocal relationship.</p> <h4><strong>A Call to Action</strong></h4> <p>The success of this framework depends on the active participation of stakeholders at every level.</p> <ul><li><strong>To Indigenous & BAZ Leaders:</strong> Your sovereignty is the cornerstone of this entire system. Embrace the tools of FPIC 2.0 and the authority of your councils to defend your territories, to define a regenerative future on your own terms, and to lead the world by demonstrating what true stewardship means.</li> <li><strong>To Policymakers:</strong> Adopt these frameworks to create the legal conditions for a just transition. Move beyond the zero-sum calculations of national interest and embrace the profound responsibility of planetary stewardship for all generations.</li> <li><strong>To Regenerative Enterprises:</strong> Demand radical transparency in your supply chains. Use the Digital Product Passport to prove your commitment to a living world, and leverage your purchasing power to support the BAZs and communities that are the vanguards of this new economy.</li> <li><strong>To All Citizens:</strong> The information provided by these systems empowers you to become a conscious participant in the global economy. Use the tools of transparency to learn the stories behind your products. Support the communities, enterprises, and policies that are building this regenerative material culture, one ethical choice at a time.</li></ul> <hr>",1);function h(e){var t=n();a(14),r(e,t)}export{h as default};
