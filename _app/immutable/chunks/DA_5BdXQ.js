The mycorrhizal networks that connect forest trees don’t control the forest but enable communication and resource sharing that makes the entire ecosystem more resilient. Planetary health governance operates similarly within the broader ecosystem of global governance frameworks—serving as the ethical compass and integrative wisdom that helps specialized systems work together for the health of our planetary home rather than competing against each other.</em></p> <h2><a id="ethical-compass"></a>Planetary Health as Ethical Compass</h2> <p>The Planetary Health
